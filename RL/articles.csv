4/3/25,The Human Toll of Trump's Anti-Trans Crusade,https://www.aclu.org/news/lgbtq-rights/the-human-toll-of-trumps-anti-trans-crusade,ACLU,Lisa Francois,Pro,2,"President Donald Trump’s assault on transgender rights is a gross overreach of presidential power and yet another attempt to punish trans people just for existing. After President Donald Trump issued an executive order restricting access to gender-affirming medical care for transgender people under 19, many hospitals nationwide abruptly cut off treatment for trans youth. This sent thousands of families scrambling, with some even wondering if they needed to leave the country to protect their family’s future.

If enforced, President Trump’s order will deny transgender youth access to medically-necessary care, like puberty blockers and hormone therapy, even as these same treatments remain readily available to their cisgender peers. The order also intends to cut or reduce federal funding for health care providers who refuse to prioritize the Trump administration’s political preferences over their patients’ medical needs. At the American Civil Liberties Union, we know that politics and partisanship have no place in patient care and we all deserve the freedom to be ourselves. On February 4th, alongside Lambda Legal and the ACLU of Maryland, we sued the Trump administration to block its discriminatory efforts to limit needed health care. We filed our suit on behalf of transgender young adults and their families, as well as PFLAG and GLMA, two of the nation’s largest organizations supporting LGBTQ+ people and healthcare professionals.

Since his first term, Trump and his administration have carried out a years-long effort to roll back protections for LGBTQ people. Beginning in January, the Trump administration issued a series of executive orders that remove protections for trans people. His directives include targeting transgender students, banning trans Americans from military service, and giving federal agencies the green light to openly discriminate against their trans employees. These orders align with the extremist vision of Project 2025, a sweeping right-wing agenda that seeks to dismantle civil rights protections, consolidate presidential power, and dehumanize transgender people. President Trump “is determined to use every level of government to drive transgender people out of public life,” says Joshua Block, senior counsel for the ACLU’s LGBT & HIV Project. For Cameron, Gabe, and Robert, three of the five trans young people challenging the Trump administration’s anti-trans agenda, this fight goes beyond the courtroom. It’s about their fundamental right to make deeply personal medical decisions without government interference.

For Cameron, words like “boy” or “girl” were never meaningful. Being seen as nonbinary makes them feel “strong, happy, recognized, and loved.” Before puberty, they worried about how others would treat them based on their clothes and pronouns. Now, as their physical-self matures, Cameron worries about how they see their own body. “The changes feel violating,” they say. “It makes me depressed, stressed, and anxious.”

After seeing a therapist, Cameron’s parents consulted a doctor who first spoke to them about puberty blockers, a temporary pause that gives people time to decide whether to undergo male or female puberty. Getting more time was a relief to Cameron who, after starting treatment at 12, remembers feeling ""less stressed and a little more hopeful."" However, Cameron’s appointment for a puberty-blocking implant was abruptly canceled after the Trump administration issued its executive order. Their anxieties came rushing back, resulting in stomach pain, restless sleep, and missed school. Their parents fought to find a new doctor. Though Cameron did finally receive their implant, they fear losing care again. “I do not want to feel like a stranger in my body,” they told the ACLU.

For Gabe, a 14-year-old transgender boy, he hopes gender-affirming medical care will help him look and sound more like himself. Often, when strangers see him in public, they address him using male pronouns. Until he speaks. His voice still does not reflect who he is and causes people to misgender him, which only adds to the anxiety and dysmorphia that began when he started puberty.

“Even when I wasn’t sure why the changes felt wrong, I just knew they were,” Gabe says, reflecting on his experience trying to navigate his changing body.

To treat his dysphoria, Gabe’s parents consulted a doctor who explained how testosterone could help him feel more comfortable in his body. Gabe knew it was the right choice for him. “I want to be in a grown-up male body when I’m older,” he says. “I want the choice to tell people, not to be revealed by my voice.”

Gabe hoped to begin testosterone treatments in March 2025, but the administration’s actions put his plans at risk. Like many trans youth, Gabe now fears that he won’t have the choice to present as he truly is.

Families of trans youth also feel the impact of Trump’s discriminatory order. Rachel, a member of PFLAG, has always prioritized her son Robert’s health and well-being. From a very early age, she knew that Robert was meant to be a boy and that “he would thrive in school and the rest of his life if we let him live that way.”

At nine, Robert was diagnosed with gender dysphoria. Rachel made sure he received the care he needed. Under medical guidance, he began puberty blockers to prevent changes that would conflict with his identity. By 14, after years of therapy and careful consideration, he started testosterone. “As his mother, I agreed with his doctors that Robert would benefit from going through puberty alongside his peers,” Rachel says.

Robert is 16 now and is “healthy, social, and thriving.” But on January 29th, Rachel received a call: Robert’s appointment, a routine check-up for his hormone therapy, was canceled. “I am devastated that the president has sought to prevent my child from accessing the health care that allows him to be his true self,” Rachel says.

Without testosterone, Rachel fears that Robert will face severe distress. “This is a child who has told me since age two that he is a boy,” she says. “He is now a young man. It would be alarming for him to suddenly develop a woman’s body.”

Cameron, Robert, Gabe, and so many families like theirs see President Trump’s assault on their rights for what it is: an overreach of presidential power to deny them the health care that serves as the foundation of their lives and their future. At the ACLU, we refuse to let politics dictate who can and cannot receive essential healthcare, but our fight is about more than policy. Like all of us, trans youth deserve to grow up with the care and support they need. We will not stop fighting until their rights are protected."
4/3/25,Perkins et al. v. State (HB 121),https://www.aclu.org/cases/perkins-et-al-v-state,ACLU,None listed,Pro,3,"HB 121, which took effect on March 27, 2025, is a draconian law that singles out transgender and intersex people for dehumanizing and discriminatory treatment. It bars transgender people from using public restrooms, changing rooms, and sleeping quarters that correspond to their gender identity in a sweeping range of public spaces—including offices, libraries, universities, state parks, and hospitals. HB 121 also imposes a restrictive binary definition of “sex” which fails to recognize intersex people, who are born with a combination of male and female sex traits. As a result, under HB 121, intersex people apparently cannot use regulated sex-separated facilities at all. What is more, HB 121 subjects regulated entities to potentially severe legal liability: any person who “encounter[s] another individual of the opposite sex” in a restroom or changing room—including a transgender individual using a facility consistent with their gender identity—can sue the entity where the encounter took place.

The ACLU’s State Supreme Court Initiative, along with the ACLU of Montana and Legal Voice, have brought suit against the State of Montana, Governor Gianforte, and Attorney General Knudsen on behalf of a group of transgender and intersex plaintiffs. Each of the plaintiffs is a Montanan who—like any other Montanan—needs access to public buildings and spaces to work, go to school, seek healthcare, and enjoy recreation, among other things. But, under HB 121, they would not be allowed access to such spaces on equal terms with everyone else. Because they are denied access to restrooms and other sex-separated facilities, the plaintiffs and other transgender and intersex people may not be able to continue working, studying, or participating in public life.

Our lawsuit argues that the Montana Constitution prohibits this discrimination. The Montana Constitution provides robust protections for individual rights and liberties that in some respects exceeds the protections afforded by the U.S. Constitution. We allege that HB 121 violates Montana’s constitutional guarantees of equal protection under the law, privacy, and due process, as well as every Montanan’s constitutional right to pursue life’s basic necessities. At this initial stage of the case, we are asking the Court to enter a preliminary injunction preventing the State from enforcing HB 121 while litigation is ongoing because of the immediate and irreparable harm that the law would inflict on transgender and intersex people."
2/11/2025,Montana Senate endorses bill tying bathrooms to biological sex,https://www.kpax.com/news/montana-senate-endorses-bill-tying-bathrooms-to-biological-sex,KPAX (local news),Jonathon Ambarian,Anti,,"A bill that would require transgender people in Montana to use the bathroom that aligns with their sex at birth has cleared one of its last legislative hurdles before going to the governor.

The Senate endorsed House Bill 121 on a 32-18 party-line vote on Monday, with all Republicans in support and all Democrats in opposition. During the debate on the Senate floor, supporters said it was a commonsense measure, but opponents warned of unintended consequences. House Bill 121 is sponsored by Rep. Kerri Seekins-Crowe, R-Billings. It would require public schools, correctional facilities, other public buildings and domestic violence shelters to designate bathrooms, changing rooms and sleeping areas for either men or women, based on their biological sex at birth, and to “take reasonable steps” to keep the opposite sex out. Someone could then sue those facilities if they failed to take those steps and someone of the opposite sex used the space.

The bill wouldn’t apply to rooms that only one person can use at a time.

Republicans argued HB 121 was needed to protect single-sex spaces, particularly for women. They said it would address concerns about violence and harassment in places where women feel especially vulnerable. “It reinforces protection for women and children and as outlined, specific spaces for their privacy and well-being,” said Sen. John Fuller, R-Kalispell. “And it's about clarity.”

Democrats said transgender people aren’t a threat to women, and that HB 121 would create the same type of discomfort it’s trying to alleviate by requiring transgender men to use women’s bathrooms.

“This is not what the people of Montana need,” said Sen. Cora Neumann, D-Bozeman. “They need you using their money wisely. They need you using our time wisely and voting on things that will actually make their lives better.”

They also argued facilities would have a hard time meeting the requirements of the bill. Sen. Laura Smith, D-Helena, proposed amending the bill to take effect in July instead of immediately when it’s signed into law. She said lawmakers have heard from shelters that say they may have to close if they don’t have more time to get into compliance.

“I don't know why we wouldn't say, ‘Let's hold on, guys, let's give ourselves a second, let’s not harm vulnerable individuals who are in shelters or who are homeless in the middle of Montana winter,’” Smith said. Smith’s motion to amend the bill failed on a 22-28 vote. Supporters of the bill said they believed concerns about shelter closures were “red herrings.”

“If it's important, the governor can make an amendatory veto at a future date, and I would suggest lobbying him,” said Fuller.

HB 121 passed the House last month. It is scheduled for a final vote in the Senate on Tuesday. Once it passes, it will be on its way to Gov. Greg Gianforte’s desk. The Gianforte administration has already indicated support for the bill, with Lt. Gov. Kristen Juras testifying in favor of it."
3/26/25,Library Patrons Sue Greenville County Over Widespread Removals and Restrictions of LGBTQ Books,https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/library-patrons-sue-greenville-county-over-widespread-removals-and-restrictions-of-lgbtq-books,ACLU,None listed,Pro,4,"GREENVILLE, S.C. – Local library patrons, with help from the American Civil Liberties Union and ACLU of South Carolina, are suing officials in South Carolina’s most populous county for systematically purging literature by and about lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) people from its public library collection.

The lawsuit asks a federal court to permanently block Greenville County’s policies and practices that have deliberately hidden or removed dozens of books that positively portray transgender and gender-nonconforming people. The ACLU and the ACLU of South Carolina filed the lawsuit today in the U.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina on behalf of families and residents of Greenville County, arguing that county officials have violated library patrons’ First and Fourteenth Amendment rights.

""Books are one of our greatest tools to learn about other peoples, the world around us, and more importantly to learn about ourselves through representation,” said Greg Rogers, a Greenville County parent and plaintiff in the lawsuit. “All children and young adults should have equal access to these tools. Keeping even one child from accessing the representation they provide is a travesty for the equality of all children.”

“For years, the library board has tried to censor patrons' access to diverse stories,” said Stephen Shelato, co-founder of Freedom in Libraries Advocacy Group (FLAG), a vibrant local library group that has lobbied hard against anti-LGBTQ discrimination at the Greenville Library. “Local parents believe that exposure to diverse stories is healthy and developmentally appropriate, but board members have repeatedly chosen instead to follow the demands of a loud minority of activists and partisan groups. Local parents are now courageously speaking out and taking action—and they deserve the full support of our community.""

“Greenville County cannot censor our public libraries merely because its officials find certain materials politically, morally, or religiously objectionable,” said Allen Chaney, Legal Director for the ACLU of South Carolina. “After years of public advocacy against these discriminatory actions, we must now rely on the courts to vindicate a simple truth: the constitution protects everyone, including LGBTQ people.”

“Greenville County’s policy is a blatant infringement on the rights we all share to learn, read, and speak as we please,” said Shana Knizhnik, Senior Staff Attorney for the ACLU’s Jon L. Stryker and Slobodan Randjelović LGBTQ & HIV Project. “Decades of First Amendment precedent protects the freedom of readers and community members like our plaintiffs, and nobody’s story is unacceptable simply because of who they are or who they love. Across the country, communities like Greenville are standing up and fighting back against efforts to push LGBTQ people from public life, and we’re hopeful the court will see through these discriminatory acts of censorship.”

New policies adopted by the Greenville County Library Board in 2024 require that all materials with “illustrations, themes, or story lines [that] affirm, portray, or discuss changing the appearance of a minor’s gender in ways inconsistent with the minor’s biological sex” or with “illustrations, themes, or storylines that celebrate, portray, or affirm gender transitioning” must be removed from the juvenile and young adult sections of the library. The library system has moved these books to adults-only sections of the library, limiting access for young readers.

Meanwhile, the library system has completely removed dozens of titles that positively portray LGBTQ people, including in adult sections of the library. As today’s court filing explains, the library system’s leadership has granted more than 50 requests from the Greenville County Republican Women’s Club to remove LGBTQ materials, while disproportionately refusing other patrons’ requests to order new LGBTQ materials.

Plaintiffs in the lawsuit identify specific books that have been removed from the Juvenile section. Amber Galea, parent of two children, says her children are interested in books that have been moved out of the Juvenile section, including Hocus and Pocus and the Spell for Home by A.R. Capetta, The Cardboard Kingdom by Chad Sell, Riding Freedom by Pam Muñoz Ryan, and Snapdragon by Kat Leyh.

The following are other examples of books that the library has moved out of juvenile and young adult sections:

Julián is a Mermaid by Jessica Love (an award-winning children’s picture book about a young boy who wishes to dress up like a mermaid)
Ana on the Edge by A.J. Sass (an award-winning book about a 12-year-old nonbinary figure skater)
Red: A Crayon’s Story by Michael Hall (a picture book about a blue crayon that was mistakenly labeled as “red”)
A list of 59 books that were removed entirely from the Greenville County library system in 2023 is available here.

The complaint filed today can be found here.

The Greenville County Library Board members who promoted anti-transgender collection policies in 2024 did not try to keep their discriminatory motives a secret. According to those board members’ public comments, library materials condoning gender fluidity are “trash” and the “idea” of “transgenderism” is a “dangerous thing.” As one library board member put it: “[T]he presence of a transgender character in a book … is grounds for relocating it to the adult section.”

Meanwhile library board members and officials have ordered Pride Month displays to be taken down, ordered library staff to remove advertising for an LGBTQ book club, and encouraged librarians to use the “weeding” process — meant to remove books that are outdated or in physical disrepair — as a pretext to throw out LGBTQ titles, including books purchased within the past five years.

These actions by library board members and library administrators have contributed to an ongoing “culture of fear,” as highlighted in an October 2023 Greenville News article. That cultural shift has led the staff turnover rate to double.

For years, local advocates and library employees have shown resilience in the face of these attacks. Greenville County residents have shown up to speak against censorship at Library Board meetings. One library board member resigned in protest in July 2022 after the board chair ordered Pride Month displays to be taken down, and a former library communications director resigned in October 2022 after being pressured to remove a TV slide promoting an LGBTQ book club.

Today’s lawsuit seeks to address the practice of viewpoint discrimination in the Greenville County Library System, which reports 1.2 million visits per year across 12 locations. The plaintiffs are asking the court to uphold the freedom to access information, a right derived from the First Amendment. They also ask the court to uphold the Fourteenth Amendment right to equal protection under the law for all Greenville County residents.

Other South Carolina library systems considering following in the path of Greenville County should take heed."
3/1/2024,Greenville Co. library board approves policy to move books with transgender themes from the children section,https://www.wyff4.com/article/sc-library-board-approves-policy-move-books-with-transgender-themes-from-children-section/60031299,WYFF,Carlos Cristian Flores,Anti,4,"The Greenville County Library Board approved a new policy on Monday that deals with books with trans themes.

First on the agenda was whether to move the book called “Melissa,"" previously published as ""George."" by Alex Gino to the parenting and early childhood section. The book is a story about a transgender 10-year-old girl.

Trustee James Hoard made a motion to remove the book altogether.

""I think it's trash. We are a taxpayer-funded facility it's not the taxpayers' duty to subsidize trash,"" Hoard said.

The motion failed but the board trustee continued to discuss whether to move the book.

Some trustees felt the decision could lead to a slippery slope.

""We're going to have an endless string of book considerations or requests on both sides right,"" Joe Poore said.

Ultimately, the board voted to move the book to the parenting and early childhood section and then moved on to discuss a new policy.

The policy brought by the Library Materials Committee Meeting would move any books that are for kids 12 years old or younger that deal with transgender themes to be located in the parenting and early childhood collection.

""These are books that will never be discovered. If you don't walk in the library already knowing this is a book you want then you will never find it,"" Freedom in Libraries Advocacy Group(FLAG) member Susan Ward said.

FLAG has been very outspoken against this issue and others involving the moving or removal of LGBTQ materials at Greenville County Public Libraries. Ward believed the move would not only affect people who are a part of the LGBTQ community but believes it creates further separation in the community as whole.

""If books about trans kids aren't available then it makes the families who don't know other families that have trans kids, it just increases that sense of otherness,"" Ward said.

The board went on to unanimously approve the policy.

After reaching out to every member of the library board for comment, WYFF heard back from two and one, Dr. Gene Beckner provided the following statement.

""My hope is that moving forward that the Greenville County Library System continues to affirm that parents are the primary source of education for their children. Parents have a fundamental right and responsibility to direct the upbringing and education of their children including issues of moral, social, physical, civic, and spiritual development.""

Of the 12 Greenville County library branches, only six have a parenting and early childhood section.

3/18/25,"State District Court of Appeals Blocks Ohio’s Ban on Gender-Affirming Care for Trans Minors, in an Historic Win for Families and Bodily Autonomy",https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/state-district-court-of-appeals-blocks-ohios-ban-on-gender-affirming-care-for-trans-minors-in-an-historic-win-for-families-and-bodily-autonomy,ACLU,None listed,Pro,2,"Today, in an historic win for bodily autonomy and LGBTQ+ Ohioans, a three judge panel on the Tenth District Court of Appeals overturned House Bill 68, Ohio’s law banning gender-affirming medical care for trans youth, and prohibiting trans women and girls from participating in sports.

The case, Moe v. Yost, was originally filed on March 26 by the American Civil Liberties Union, the ACLU of Ohio, and the global law firm Goodwin on behalf of two families whose transgender adolescents would be negatively impacted by HB 68. On August 6, following a five-day trial in July, the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas rejected the plaintiffs’ challenge, and allowed the ban to take effect. Today, transgender youth in Ohio will once again be able to access lifesaving healthcare.

The following is reaction to the ruling:

Freda Levenson, Legal Director at the ACLU of Ohio:

“Today, we celebrate this win not only for our brave plaintiffs, but for all LGBTQ+ Ohioans and their families. This win restores the right of trans youth in Ohio to choose vitally important health care, with the support of their families and physicians. We are gratified by the Court’s decision, which soundly rejects this interference of politicians with Ohioans’ bodily autonomy. Although this litigation will likely not end here, we remain fervently committed to preventing this egregious bill from ever again taking effect. The path towards protecting the rights and civil liberties of trans Ohioans goes on, and we will continue to hold the torch.”

Harper Seldin, Senior Staff Attorney, American Civil Liberties Union:
“This is a critical victory for transgender youth and their families across Ohio. The state’s ban is discriminatory, baseless, and a danger to the well-being of the same Ohioan youth lawmakers claim to want to protect. It’s also part of a sweeping effort to drive trans people out of public life altogether by controlling our health care, our families, and our lives. We’re thankful the court upheld their rights under the state constitution.”

Miranda Hooker, Complex Litigation & Dispute Resolution Partner, Goodwin:

""We applaud the families who courageously shared their personal experiences to oppose House Bill 68. This victory underscores the critical need to safeguard bodily autonomy and access to essential healthcare. The decision marks an important milestone in advancing equality and personal freedom for all Ohioans and we will continue to fight against the unconstitutional Bill moving forward."""

The ruling comes after a Franklin County judge refused in August to permanently block House Bill 68, which banned transgender-affirming care for minors and boys competing in girls sports.

Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost promised to appeal.

“This is a no-brainer – we are appealing that decision and will seek an immediate stay,” Yost said. “There is no way I’ll stop fighting to protect these unprotected children. Ohio’s elected representatives properly passed legislation protecting children from irreversible chemical sex change procedures, and the trial court upheld the law. But now the 10th District Court of Appeals has just greenlighted these permanent medical interventions against minors.” A three-judge panel on the 10th District Court of Appeals blocked the law.

“Today, we celebrate this win not only for our brave plaintiffs but for all LGBTQ+ Ohioans and their families,” ACLU-Ohio Legal Director Freda Levenson said in a statement. “This win restores the right of trans youth in Ohio to choose vitally important health care, with the support of their families and physicians.

Although this litigation will likely not end here, we remain fervently committed to preventing this egregious bill from ever again taking effect. The path towards protecting the rights and civil liberties of trans Ohioans goes on, and we will continue to hold the torch.”

The ACLU sued in March 2024 on behalf of two families in Franklin County to stop the once-vetoed bill from taking effect in late April of that year. The lawsuit said the bill violates the Ohio Constitution’s single subject, the health care provision, the equal protection clause, and the due course of law provision.

The legislation blocks gender-affirming care for minors, including surgeries, puberty blockers, and hormone therapy.

In December 2023, Gov. Mike DeWine vetoed the bill and a week later issued an executive order that banned gender-affirming surgeries on minors and developed corresponding health care rules for children and adults.

The Republican-majority Senate easily voted to override the veto in late January. The House, also majority Republican, did the same earlier in the month.

The ACLU calls gender-affirming care lifesaving health care supported by major medical associations nationwide, including the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Psychological Association."
9/5/24,"The Supreme Court Case on Trans Health Care, Explained.",https://www.aclu.org/news/lgbtq-rights/the-supreme-court-case-on-trans-health-care-explained,ACLU,Gillian Branstetter,Pro,2 or 5,"Since 2021, 24 states have banned hormone therapy for transgender youth with gender dysphoria. Leading medical experts and organizations — such as the American Medical Association, the American Psychiatric Association, and the American Academy of Pediatrics — oppose these restrictions, which have already forced thousands of families across the country to travel to maintain access to medical care or watch their child suffer without it.

In July 2023, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected requests from families and medical providers to block laws in Tennessee and Kentucky banning gender-affirming medical care for transgender youth. At the same time, the Court elected to combine the requests, linking plaintiffs like a Nashville-based couple and their transgender teenage daughter, and a medical provider who supports trans youth  with families in Kentucky. Both states asked the United States Supreme Court to rule on whether these laws are unconstitutional. This year, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case, now listed as U.S. v. Skrmetti. The plaintiffs in the Tennessee case are represented by the American Civil Liberties Union, the ACLU of Tennessee, Lambda Legal, and Akin Gump. Our legal challenge is limited to the provisions of Tennessee’s ban targeting hormone therapies — such as hormone replacement therapy and puberty blockers — and does not implicate surgical care. To understand what’s at stake, the ACLU breaks down the case and who it impacts. We also share what we can all do to protect gender-affirming care and support trans rights.

How Could U.S. v. Skrmetti. Impact Trans Health Care?
The question in this case is whether Tennessee’s law banning gender-affirming hormone therapies for transgender minors violates the Equal Protection Clause of the US Constitution. Tennessee’s ban, like every other passed by politicians in recent years, specifically permits these same hormone medications when they are provided in a way that Tennessee considers “consistent” with a person’s sex designated at birth. This means, for example, a doctor could prescribe estrogen to a cisgender teenage girl for any clinical diagnosis but could not do the same for a transgender girl diagnosed with gender dysphoria.

The ACLU argues that Tennessee’s ban is a clear example of discrimination on the basis of sex and transgender status making it a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment of the Constitution. We made a similar argument in 2020 when, alongside other legal advocates, we successfully argued in front of the Supreme Court on behalf of LGBTQ clients fired because of their sexual orientation and gender identity, including a transgender woman fired from her job at a Michigan funeral home. In a 6-3 ruling, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of LGBTQ workers and found “it is impossible to discriminate against a person for being homosexual or transgender without discriminating against that individual based on sex” and therefore discrimination against LGBTQ workers was impermissible sex discrimination under Title VII, the federal law prohibiting sex discrimination in employment.

In recent years, district courts unanimously blocked bans in Arkansas, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, and Tennessee, but the Sixth, Seventh, and Eleventh Circuit Courts of Appeals have allowed these bans to take effect. The Supreme Court must now decide whether states can ban medical treatment for transgender youth with gender dysphoria, but not whether they must. If the court finds Tennessee’s law constitutional, the immediate impact on access to these treatments will be limited to the two states where the bans are already in effect.

How Does this Case Impact Other Health Care, Like Birth Control?
When arguing against transgender people and their families, states with bans like Tennessee’s have relied heavily on the Supreme Court’s opinion Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, which overturned Roe v. Wade and allowed states to ban abortion. U.S. v. Skrmetti will be a major test of how far the court is willing to stretch Dobbs to allow states to ban other health care. The court’s ruling could serve as a stepping stone towards further limiting access to abortion, IVF, and birth control."
12/5/2024,Most Justices Skeptical of Interfering With Tennessee’s Ban on ‘Gender-Affirming Care’ for Minors,https://www.dailysignal.com/2024/12/04/most-justices-skeptical-interfering-state-bans-gender-affirming-care-minors/?utm_source=chatgpt.com,The Daily Signal,"Sarah Parshall Perry, Thomas Jipping ",Anti,2 or 5,"The U.S. Supreme Court had only one case slated for oral argument Wednesday morning, but it was a doozy.

With protesters chanting outside, the court heard arguments for two-and-a-half hours from attorneys for the state of Tennessee, the Department of Justice, and the ACLU in a challenge to the constitutionality of Tennessee’s ban on “gender-affirming” care for minors.

In U.S. v. Skrmetti, the Biden Justice Department and the ACLU argued that the state law violates the equal protection clause of the Constitution’s 14th Amendment because it discriminates based on sex. To the contrary, the state of Tennessee and its attorney general, Jonathan Skrmetti, say the law restricts conduct based only on age (for those children under the age of 18) and how certain drugs are used (for so-called gender-affirming care). Legal challenges to these types of laws are typically brought by parents who seek drugs, such as puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones, and surgical intervention for their children who profess to identify with the opposite sex. They argue that laws like Tennessee’s violate two parts of the 14th Amendment—the due process clause, by depriving parents of the right to make medical decisions for their children, and the equal protection clause, by discriminating against their children based on sex.

President Joe Biden’s administration, rather than parents, brought this challenge, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit rejected both arguments. Last year, the 8th Circuit struck down a similar Arkansas law, but only on equal protection grounds.
The Supreme Court, therefore, is addressing only that argument, because that is the one on which the 6th and 8th circuits disagreed. During the argument, however, Justice Amy Coney Barrett clarified that upholding the Tennessee statute on equal protection grounds would not prevent parents from pursuing their claim that such laws violate the due process clause.

‘Main Issue on the Table’
The heart of the challengers’ case is that the Tennessee statute treats people differently based on sex. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson agreed that this is the “main issue on the table.” The kind of classification of a law is important to determining the appropriate standard of review, which in turn determines how easy or difficult it is to defend that law against a challenge under the equal protection clause.

Most laws that make distinctions as to when they will or will not apply do not do so on the basis of a “suspect class.” Such laws are subject to rational basis review and are constitutional if they are a “rational” way of addressing a “legitimate” legislative purpose—a relatively easy standard to meet.

If a law makes distinctions by classifying people based on a “sex,” it is subject to heightened or “intermediate scrutiny” review. Such laws will be upheld only if they are “substantially related” to achieving an “important” government purpose.

As Tennessee persuasively argues, rather than classifying based on sex, the law classifies on based on purpose. In other words, it distinguishes based on minors seeking drugs for gender transition and minors seeking drugs for any other medical purposes. The Supreme Court has never recognized restrictions on the use of drugs for a particular medical purpose to demand heightened scrutiny review, so rational-basis review applies.

That standard, the state of Tennessee easily satisfies, and the 6th Circuit agreed. ‘A Sex-Based Classification’?
But the challengers want to label the law a sex-based classification to make it harder for Tennessee to defend.

Arguing for the Biden administration, U.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar asked the court simply to put the Tennessee statute in that category and send the case back to the lower courts to apply the “intermediate scrutiny” review test. But Justice Brett Kavanaugh observed that, if it did, the case would soon be right back in the Supreme Court’s lap.

Prelogar insisted that the Tennessee statute is obviously based on sex, but her argument is inconsistent with the text of the statute itself. She argued that the law would allow a boy to obtain puberty-blockers to delay experiencing a normal male puberty, but a girl could not. But the statute only says that a minor may not obtain such drugs for the purposes of identifying with a different sex—and that prohibition applies equally to both boys and to girls.

Despite Prelogar’s insistence, the law only restricts access to the drugs based on age and on the medical use of the drugs.

Kavanaugh, Chief Justice John Roberts, and Justice Samuel Alito expressed hesitancy about involving themselves in issues that are better left to state legislatures to decide.

‘Leave the Issue to the Legislatures’?
Roberts argued that the court was “not [in] the best situation to make determinations about medical considerations. Doesn’t that make the case for us to leave the issue to the legislatures?” He also alluded to the court’s landmark ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization in June 2022, which overturned Roe v. Wade, saying that the current case was really about “constitutional allocations of authority.” In an almost verbatim recitation from the Dobbs majority opinion, he continued: “Perhaps we should leave this issue to the people and their elected representatives.”

Roberts and Kavanaugh also stressed the shaky scientific footing of gender “medicine,” and cited various European reports, saying that “countries who have been at the forefront [are now] pumping the brakes on this,” something that Kavanaugh noted gave the court “a yellow light, if not a red light” in moving forward into “constitutionalizing” a new area of law.

But it was perhaps the line of questioning from Alito that was the most intense of the morning. Alito, too, cited specific studies from Sweden and England, including the bombshell Cass report, which indicated that gender medicine is largely unproven and presents significant health risks to children.

He chided Prelogar, saying that she had “relegated [it] to a footnote.”

In their briefs, both the government and the ACLU asserted a different basis on which the court could provide relief.

If the justices didn’t think the law discriminated based on sex, they could find that the law discriminated on the basis of transgender status, and that, too, they argued, would require that the law be subject to intermediate scrutiny review. This alternative argument also took center stage in Wednesday’s argument. A majority of the justices, however, did not seem to buy it.

Both Barrett and Alito pointed out that the court had turned down other requests to expand constitutionally protected categories, such as age and mental disability. Their line of demarcation in equal protection clause cases had always been immutable characteristics—those derived by accident of birth, such as race, sex, and national origin.

So, when transgender lawyer Chase Strangio took the podium for the ACLU, Alito continued his grilling, asking pointedly “Is transgender status immutable?” When Strangio responded that it would indeed “satisfy an immutability test,” Alito peppered the ACLU lawyer with various hypotheticals: What about people who are “gender-fluid,” or who change gender identities over time, or who are “nonbinary”?

‘An Immutable Characteristic’?
When Strangio floundered, Alito retorted, “So, transgender status is not an immutable characteristic, is it?”

Unsurprisingly, the more liberal members of the court, Jackson and Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, appeared more favorable to Prelogar’s and Strangio’s arguments. Jackson likened the current case to Loving v. Virginia, the court’s landmark civil rights decision that determined that laws banning interracial marriage violated the Equal Protection and Due Process clauses of the 14th Amendment.

In arguing that the state had once legislated in such a way based on racial classifications, and that the court had overridden those state legislative judgments based on the Constitution’s promise of equality, Jackson argued it should do the same here.  Twenty-six states have passed laws similar to Tennessee’s in the past few years, and some of them have been challenged in the courts. But U.S. v. Skrmetti is the first case of its kind to reach the Supreme Court.

The court’s decision, which likely won’t be issued till June, no doubt will have a significant impact on the legislative and litigation efforts on this controversial issue for years to come."
12/17/24,Montana Court Blocks State From Refusing to Correct Sex Markers on Transgender People's Birth Certificates and Driver's Licenses,https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/montana-court-blocks-state-from-refusing-to-correct-sex-markers-on-transgender-peoples-birth-certificates-and-drivers-licenses,ACLU,None listed,Pro,6,"A Montana court has granted a preliminary injunction preventing the state of Montana from enforcing policies that bar transgender people from obtaining accurate sex designations on their birth certificates and driver’s licenses.

After a prior restriction on amendments of birth certificates was struck down by the courts, in early 2024 the state of Montana enacted a new rule that categorically bars transgender Montanans from correcting the sex designation on their birth certificates. Around the same time, the Montana Department of Justice adopted a policy similarly restricting amendment of driver’s licenses. The plaintiffs challenged these policies in state district court, arguing that they violate various constitutional provisions, including the right to equal protection of the law.

In a recent Montana Supreme Court decision, two justices concluded that discrimination on the basis of transgender status – as the state is engaging in here – is a form of sex discrimination that violates the Montana Constitution’s equal protection clause.

The plaintiffs, two transgender women, are represented by the American Civil Liberties Union, the ACLU of Montana, and Nixon Peabody LLP.

Plaintiff Jessica Kalarchik, a veteran who served in the United States Army for 31 years, said: “After finally being able to live my life openly as the woman I know myself to be, I am frustrated that my birth state, Montana, wants me to carry around a birth certificate that incorrectly lists my sex as male. I live my life openly as a woman, I am treated as a woman in my daily life, and there is no reason I should be forced to carry a birth certificate that incorrectly identifies me as male. Fortunately, the court agrees that this ridiculous policy should not be in effect.”

“Once again the State of Montana chose to adopt a draconian policy that is clearly intended to marginalize transgender Montanans, only for that discriminatory action to be blocked by the courts,” said Akilah Deernose, executive director for the ACLU of Montana. “Here in Montana we treasure our right to privacy and to live our lives free from governmental intrusion. The State of Montana clearly has not learned any lessons from the past few years, where courts have repeatedly struck down unconstitutional laws targeting transgender Montanans.”

“Forcing anyone to carry documents that contradict their identity unjustly violates their rights to privacy, equal treatment, and not being compelled to convey a government message about their sex that they disagree with,” said Malita Picasso, staff attorney for the ACLU’s LGBTQ & HIV Project. “Such a policy marks transgender people for further mistreatment and discrimination, essentially requiring them to carry papers that out them as transgender any time they need to provide identity documents. Fortunately, the court has refused to allow the state of Montana to subvert the freedom of transgender Montanans to control their own identity as this case goes forward.”

In granting the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction, the court held, “[i]f the challenged state actions discriminate against transgender individuals on the basis of their transgender status, they also necessarily discriminate the basis of sex.”

The state has the option of appealing the district court’s ruling to the Montana Supreme Court, but the underlying case will proceed in district court. A trial has not yet been scheduled."
12/18/2024,Montana judge temporarily blocks rules banning transgender people from changing sex on state documents,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/montana-judge-temporarily-blocks-rules-banning-transgender-people-from-changing-sex-state-documents,Fox,Stephen Sorace ,Anti,6,"A rule banning transgender people in Montana from changing the sex designation on their birth certificates and driver’s licenses will be temporarily blocked following a state judge’s ruling.

District Judge Mike Menahan on Monday ruled that the ban would be blocked while the case proceeds through the courts.

Chase Scheuer, press secretary for the attorney general's office in Montana, told Fox News Digital in a statement on Wednesday that the office is reviewing the judge's order to determine what steps to take next. ""The judiciary has once again defied the democratic will of Montanans by siding with special interest groups and radical leftist ideology,"" Scheuer said. Under state law, transgender people born in Montana are blocked from changing the sex designation on their birth certificate, and transgender residents are prevented from changing the sex on their driver’s licenses without an amended birth certificate.

Two transgender women filed the case in April on behalf of themselves and others who have been unable to obtain documents ""that accurately reflect their sex,"" the complaint said. The state had argued that sex is binary, either male or female, and that being transgender is not a protected class of people who could have their constitutional rights to privacy violated.

Menahan said it was not necessary at this point in the litigation to determine whether transgender Montanans constitute a special class on the basis of their transgender status, and disagreed with the state’s argument that discrimination on the basis of transgender status is not discrimination on the basis of sex. ""If the challenged state actions discriminate against transgender individuals on the basis of their transgender status, they also necessarily discriminate on the basis of sex,"" he wrote. The ruling comes days after the Montana supreme court temporarily blocked a state law banning transgender surgeries for minors, saying the law likely violates Montana’s constitutional right to privacy.

1/22/25,"Trump's Executive Orders Promoting Sex Discrimination, Explained",https://www.aclu.org/news/lgbtq-rights/trumps-executive-orders-promoting-sex-discrimination-explained,ACLU,Gillian Branstetter,Pro,3,"Donald Trump was re-elected president on a wave of attacks against women and transgender people. Anti-transgender politicians spent more than $215 million on ads scapegoating trans people and promoting a Project 2025 agenda that threatens to rollback reproductive freedom and punish people for departing from archaic gender roles. On his first day back in office, President Trump signed a far-reaching executive order requiring federal agencies to discriminate against transgender people by denying who they are and threatening the freedom of self-determination and self-expression for all.

In 2020, the Supreme Court issued a 6-3 ruling in Bostock v. Clayton County affirming that discrimination against someone because they are LGBTQ is sex discrimination under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Justice Neil Gorsuch, writing for the majority, said: “it is impossible to discriminate against a person for being homosexual or transgender without discriminating against that individual based on sex.” Trump also withdrew an executive order issued by former President Joe Biden directing federal agencies to enforce this court ruling as applied to all laws prohibiting sex discrimination.

We all deserve the freedom to be ourselves, including the right to determine what’s right for our bodies and lives. Trump’s sex discrimination mandate threatens to deny that freedom to transgender people across the country while forcing everyone else to sacrifice their own freedom and privacy, too.

What Does the Order Say?
Trump’s signed order states: “It is the policy of the United States to recognize two sexes, male and female.  These sexes are not changeable and are grounded in fundamental and incontrovertible reality.” The order defines terms like “man” and “woman” based on whether a person “at conception” belongs “to the sex that produces the large reproductive cell” or that “produces the small reproductive cell.”

Trump’s order then directs federal agencies to “enforce laws governing sex-based rights, protections, opportunities, and accommodations” using his cramped definitions, including designating sex on passports and other federal identification documents, or determining where transgender people are confined in federal custody. The order also includes a sweeping mandate to all agencies to “end the Federal funding of gender ideology.” Of course, the order does not explain what that means or how agencies would accomplish such a task.

For decades, feminist legal scholars and women’s rights advocates have opposed efforts to define gender based strictly on biology. Recent state laws that use these definitions to discriminate against transgender people have resulted in invasive and traumatizing efforts to determine who “counts” as a man or as a woman, targeting youth who are even suspected of being transgender because they do not conform to sex stereotypes. This order likewise ignores the existence of intersex people and others with variations in sex characteristics beyond the overly-simplistic definitions Trump endorsed.

What Does the Order Do?
Very few executive orders change policy immediately, and they cannot change laws passed by Congress or protections guaranteed by the Constitution. As of January 21, 2025 it is unclear how the Trump administration will enforce this order as applied to educational settings, health care access, housing, federally-funded programs, and many other areas where federal law or policy references “sex” or “gender.”

Some of the most immediate impacts will likely be felt by the more than 2,000 transgender people currently held in federal custody. The order specifically calls on the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to ignore the guidelines of the Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA) and enforce a blanket policy forcing transgender women into men’s prisons and detention centers against their will. This puts them at a severely heightened risk of sexual assault and abuse by other incarcerated persons and prison staff. The order also mandates that BOP withdraw critical health care from trans people in federal prison.

We also expect to see immediate impacts on access to updated sex designations on U.S. passports. Transgender people frequently update the sex designation on documents like birth certificates, driver’s licenses, and passports to reflect their gender identity rather than the sex they were assigned at birth. Requiring transgender peoples’ passports to show the sex they were assigned at birth effectively outs them as transgender whenever they have to present the document.

Soon after the order was issued, a Trump administration official told a reporter that the policy impacting gender markers on U.S. passports would not apply retroactively for current passport holders. Trump’s order will, however, prevent transgender and intersex people from obtaining new passports, visas, and trusted traveler documents that reflect who they are and how they are perceived in the world.

The State Department recently said that all applications for gender change are ""suspended."" Because people have to provide their existing passport and other documents to update their passport, if people attempt to update the sex designation on their passport now, they run the risk of not having a valid passport at all while the passport is out of their possession.

What Happens Next?
We expect the order may be enforced in other contexts, such as in public schools and sex-separated spaces. It may also be used to limit workplace protections and to limit federally-funded programs that provide access for gender-affirming health care. If federal agencies and departments act to make those risks a reality, the ACLU and other LGBTQ rights organizations will fight them every step of the way."
4/18/25 (last update),Marquez v. State of Montana,https://www.aclu.org/cases/marquez-v-state-montana,ACLU,None listed,Pro,6,"Senate Bill 280 makes it difficult, if not impossible, for transgender people born in Montana to correct the sex marker listed on their birth certificates. This law requires a transgender person to obtain a court order indicating that their “sex . . . has been changed by surgical procedure,” even though surgery changes one’s anatomy rather than one’s sex and even though surgery is unwanted, unnecessary, or cost-prohibitive for many transgender individuals born in Montana. Before the passage of SB 280, transgender individuals born in Montana only needed to provide an affidavit attesting to their sex to change the sex marker on their birth certificate. The Montana legislature put an end to this straightforward process, even though it had worked effectively without incident. SB 280 burdens transgender Montanans’ ability to obtain an accurate birth certificate, solely because they are transgender.

The effects of having an inaccurate birth certificate can be life-altering. For starters, an incorrect birth certificate can disclose the fact that a person is transgender without their consent. Additionally, employers, healthcare workers, government employees and officials, and others may harass and discriminate against transgender people whose identification documents do not align with their gender.

The ACLU, the ACLU of Montana, and Nixon Peabody LLP have challenged SB 280 in court, because it violates transgender Montanans’ right to equal protection, privacy, and due process.

UPDATE: On June 26, 2023, the trial court granted summary judgment in our favor and permanently enjoined enforcement of the Montana law and regulation barring a change of the sex marker on one’s birth certificate without obtaining a court order that one has been surgically changed as unconstitutionally vague under the Montana Constitution. The trial court also granted us attorneys’ fees for all our work in the case. It also held defendants in contempt for failing to comply with the preliminary injunction previously granted in the case."
4/10/25,"Fact Sheet: Mahmoud v. Taylor, the U.S. Supreme Court Case About Banning LGBTQ-inclusive Books",https://glaad.org/fact-sheet-mahmoud-v-taylor-banning-lgbtq-books/,GLAAD,None listed,Pro,4,"The Supreme Court of the United States is scheduled to hear oral arguments in Mahmoud v. Taylor on Tuesday, April 22, 2025.

Mahmoud v. Taylor is about a small number of LGBTQ-inclusive children’s books included in the classrooms of Montgomery County (Maryland) Public Schools. The books were chosen and evaluated by education professionals. Six parents (three couples) sued the school district board of education claiming their religious freedom was violated by not having an option to opt out their children from classrooms where the books might be part of curriculum, including when offered as nonmandatory supplemental learning materials.

Context to know and report:

In 2022, Montgomery County Public Schools (MCPS) in Maryland expanded their curriculum book collection with nine inclusive picture books for children. An MCPS committee selected the titles and completed the necessary evaluation forms, which were then reviewed by a content supervisor, according to district protocol. 
The school board stated in legal filings, “the books are made available for individual reading, classroom read-alouds, and other educational activities designed to foster and enhance literacy skills.
A district official said the books were to be integrated “into the curriculum in the same way that other books are used, namely, to put them on a shelf for students to find on their own; to recommend a book to a student who would enjoy it; to offer the books as an option for literature circles, book clubs, or paired reading groups; or to use them as a read aloud.”
The district’s communications director, Jessica Baxter, said the books tell “joyful stories of folks who happen to be part of the LGBTQ+ community,” and that they “celebrate and positively portray LGBTQ+ identities.” 
Three couples filed a lawsuit against MCPS in 2023, objecting to the books and claiming the district infringed on their religious rights by not allowing them to opt out their children from potential exposure to the books.
The plaintiffs are represented by Becket, formerly known as Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, a legal group with an anti-LGBTQ history that includes representing a school that fired a 15-year veteran teacher for being gay and marrying her partner of 25 years. Southern Poverty Law Center describes Becket as a “hardline” group that promotes legislation and lawsuits to justify anti-gay discrimination. Becket has also vigorously pursued banning access to abortion and access to contraception.
People of faith support LGBTQ people and equality, and LGBTQ people are also people of faith. 67% of adult Americans say being LGBTQ should be accepted by society, including 59% of religiously-affiliated adults. 
Two-thirds of U.S. Catholics, Protestants and other Christians oppose using religious beliefs as an excuse to discriminate against LGBTQ people.
UCLA’s Williams Institute: 2.6 million LGBTQ adults are raising children under age 18.
24% of all LGBTQ parents live in the Northeast U.S., which encompasses Maryland. 31% live in the U.S. South. Approximately 5 million children in the U.S. are being raised by an LGBTQ parent. 20% of LGBTQ people in Maryland are raising children.

PEN America has documented more than 16,000 book bans in public schools nationwide since 2021, predominantly targeting books by and about LGBTQ people and books about people of color and race and racism. In its latest report Cover to Cover in February, the organization found 29% of all banned titles during the 2023-2024 school year featured LGBTQ+ characters, people, or themes.
PEN America has tracked tactics used to ban books across the country. Religious freedom arguments are the latest way to try to get books, especially with LGBTQ themes and characters, banned. Mahmoud v. Taylor has the potential to dramatically escalate book bans across the country by giving legal cover to discriminatory censorship, particularly targeting LGBTQ narratives.
The American Library Association (ALA) tracked 414 book ban attempts against public school and library materials, encompassing 1,128 unique titles, in the first eight months of 2024. 
The U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear the plaintiffs’ appeal after their requests to force the school district to provide opt outs while the case was being litigated lost in both the lower federal trial and appellate court. Federal Court of Appeals Judge Steven Agee noted there was no “evidentiary link showing that the Storybooks are being implemented in a way that directly or indirectly coerces the Parents or their children to believe or act contrary to their religious faith.”  
The Supreme Court reached out to take this case at a very early stage and potentially decide it on a group of parents’ claims despite the fact that the case had not yet proceeded to the point where there was a record of how the books were actually being used in the classroom.
The authors and illustrators of books at issue in this lawsuit issued a statement in support of inclusive books: “We stand in support of the Montgomery County School District. We oppose censoring or segregating books, like ours, that feature LGBTQ+ people. All families deserve to be seen and heard. To act otherwise is harmful and sends a devastating message to students: that their lives and families are so offensive and dangerous that they can’t even be discussed in school.”
The books include the picture book Uncle Bobby’s Wedding, a celebration of family featuring a girl who finds that her favorite uncle’s marriage means she’s gaining another uncle, not losing one. The book was selected as a best picture book honoree by Kirkus Reviews. Author Sarah Brannen told Mombian’s Dana Rudolph: “Children need to see themselves in books. The books in the lawsuit need to be in the school and accessible to all the children in the school, without interference… we all know by now that banning books is the first step toward banning people.”
The authors of Jacob’s Room to Choose (about making schools and restrooms safe for all children) wrote in Time: “We believe that people have a fundamental right to practice and express their faith, but not when it harms others. Allowing families to opt their children out of reading our books hurts the children whose lives and families are reflected in those books. “Opt-out” policies starkly communicate to classrooms of children that behaving decently to all human beings is optional and tells kids who are different that they and their families don’t merit the respect of all their classmates.”
There has been prior precedent in the federal circuit courts ruling in favor of access to inclusive books. For example, in 2008, The U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal by two Lexington, Mass., couples, leaving in place a First Circuit Court of Appeals decision that, like four other federal circuit courts of appeals, held that participation in public school instruction cannot alone burden the right to free exercise of religion absent some “coercive effect.” The First Court held that merely exposing a child to ideas that conflict with the religious beliefs of their parents “does not inhibit the parent from instructing the child differently.”
Opt-out policies are costly for taxpayers, student education, and schools: “The administrative burden of having to notify parents, collect their responses, answer any questions they may have about the material, and determine what the opted-out students will do during class time when the LGBTQ books are read may dissuade schools from including LGBTQ books in the first place.”
Center for American Progress: Book bans “require tens of thousands of hours from teachers, librarians, and administrators to review the books and implement a system of censorship—all at a time when school resources are already stretched thin, and states across the country are facing teacher and staff shortages.”
First Book Research & Insights: A poll of 1,500 teachers and librarians revealed “book bans are negatively impacting their ability to teach,” undermine their expertise, and “contribute to a sense of erasing people and history.” Of the respondents, “72 percent noted that when students’ access to books is restricted, their reading engagement declines.”
EveryLibrary Institute: Polling and surveys reveal “a significant majority of the public opposes book bans, with a substantial majority of voters in some surveys supporting state legislation to protect individuals’ rights to read freely. Some surveys show that as many as three-quarters of voters believe that ensuring people have access to diverse books is essential. More than half of Americans appear to feel that book bans infringe on their right to make decisions for their children.”"

Notable Anti-LGBTQ Incidents Targeting Affirming Religious Communities

3/9/25: Multiple people made death threats against the First Congregational United Church of Christ in Park Ridge, New Jersey, after the local Moms for Liberty chapter posted about the church’s Pride flag and falsely claimed it supported “pedophilia.” One of the threats claimed that the church must be punished “with gasoline and a match.”
1/22/25: Multiple people sent death threats to Bishop Mariann Edgar Budde at the Episcopal Diocese of Washington D.C., following her sermon during President Trump’s inauguration where she called for mercy on LGBTQ and immigrant people. 
9/7/24: A person vandalized the Pride-themed walkway leading to the Immanuel Congregational Church in Hartford, Connecticut. The graffiti read: “Fuck f****ts,” and occurred a week prior to the church’s Pride event. 
8/17/24: A person tore down a Pride flag at the home of a local rabbi in South Whitehall Township, Pennsylvania, and blew it up with fireworks. They then x’d out the word “gay” on the flag with spray paint. 
7/28/24: A person stole Pride flags and left anti-LGBTQ letters at two churches in Natick, Massachusetts. At First Congregational Church and Christ Lutheran Church, multiple Pride flags were damaged and replaced with a banner that read: “Jesus is King.”
6/17/24: A person was arrested for planning a mass murder targeting LGBTQ people, religious institutions, hospitals, schools, and supermarkets in Owosso, Michigan. Police reported that they found an Israeli flag in the suspect’s home with the words “anti-Jew f****t killer” and “death to you all.”
Despite the fear these incidents aim to inspire, they instead shed light on the heroic figures at the head of these groundbreaking and affirming faith-based communities. The ALERT Desk sat down with leaders from across the religious spectrum to speak about their experiences with anti-LGBTQ hate and how they overcome it to serve all people.

“We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly affects all indirectly.” – Martin Luther King, Jr.

These are the words that Rev. Mark Suriano used to open his sermon at the First Congregational United Church of Christ, the Sunday after his church received death threats regarding their Pride flag. 

Rev. Suriano continued: “I have always loved [this] quote from Martin Luther King Jr., in theory. When he speaks of ‘an inescapable network of mutuality’ and ‘a single garment of destiny,’ my heart has always warmed. But this past week, I, for the first time, had the most palpable sense of these ideas in action… It was a weekend of terror, grief, and [exhaustion.] But, in the midst of all that, the outpouring of support far surpassed the hateful and violent rhetoric against us.” 

“I remain emotional about this physical manifestation of the ‘inescapable network of mutuality’ and the ‘seamless garment of destiny’ of which Martin Luther King, Jr. spoke. I also am overwhelmed by the beautiful truth that what affects one of us directly affects all of us indirectly.”

Presiding Bishop Elizabeth Eaton of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ECLA) echoed Rev. Suriano’s sentiments. “Bullying and discrimination have no place in the body of Christ, but, sadly, reminders are still needed. Jesus’ command that we love one another does not come with a caveat about who we are to love. Recent acts of violence at churches that affirm the LGBTQIA+ community and the congregations’ supportive ministries must not be tolerated. As a church, we must be even more committed to lifting up the dignity, safety and humanity of our LGBTQIA+ siblings or we will be worse off as a church and as a nation.” 

Rev. Terri Steed Pierce, an out pastor at the Joy Metropolitan Community Church in Orlando, Florida, has faced her fair share of hate, including demonstrators trying to disrupt her Sunday service in recent weeks. She summed it up neatly: “We say ‘all people are welcome here,’ but all behaviors aren’t and that means those that come with hate… Those who have a problem with that can take it up with Jesus.”

prabhdeep singh kehal leads the Sikh LGBTQIA+ Oral History Project and has seen firsthand the power of having religious leaders condemn anti-LGBTQ hate. “Working with LGBTQIA+ Sikh voices is an honor and one of the most rewarding experiences I have had in my life,” says kehal. “In a time when governments are using LGBTQIA+ communities as fodder to consolidate their own conservative, theocratic agendas, it is queer and trans affirming spaces that keep the energy to fight back going. And that is why politicians and conservatives target the places of safety for which we have fought to create – within and outside faith-based spaces.” 

“Faith leaders are at an important position in challenging these pathologizing, theocratic interpretations of LGBTQIA+ lives because ‘God’ is being used again to turn an entire group of people into a target for those already in power… Their voices and positions are needed and that is why they are being targeted, because affirming and supporting faith leaders are able to speak back against claims that the Divine advocates for harming LGBTQIA+ beings.” 

Ravjot Mehek Singh, a queer Sikh activist and award-winning filmmaker, added on: “As a Sikh in post 9/11 America, the racist attacks I experienced growing up in a predominantly White community left me traumatized and in doubt of my own identity. With my queerness, I get attacked oftentimes by my own community of conservative Sikhs, especially online where I am constantly doxxed and my videos collect thousands of hateful, violent comments. Because of my intersectional identity, I switch between facing threats from Americans and my own community – creating an often endless loop of hate… But Sikhi was founded to include all people regardless of gender or social standing, and I hope that the work I do alongside other brilliant advocates helps push for that equality to be acknowledged in its truest form.” 

“There is no right way to be queer, there is no right way to be Sikh, there is no right way to be American, and anyone who tries to silence the way you exist in this world is a victim that is unable to comprehend the incredible multitudes that you contain. There is no rulebook to existing as oneself, so pursue all the things that make you feel whole.”

As President & CEO of Keshet, a national LGBTQ Jewish organization, Idit Klein knows all too well what it’s like to be at the intersection of communities under attack. “It has been an especially painful and complex time for American Jews in the wake of the October 7th Hamas attacks, the ensuing bloodshed and suffering in Israel and Gaza, and rising antisemitism here in the U.S. It also is an increasingly dangerous time for LGBTQ+ people as we face growing attacks on our rights and protections across the country. Against this backdrop, Keshet believes that remaining connected to each other across identities and movements is more important than ever.” 

“As an organization committed to the full equality of LGBTQ+ Jews, we know that we cannot ever separate these parts of ourselves,” said Klein. “We work for a world free of homophobia, transphobia, and antisemitism. We work to find meaning and strength in this painful moment as many of us navigate rupture, uncertainty, and fear, whether in political spaces in our Jewish communities, and/or LGBTQ+ spaces.” 

Keshet’s Bay Area Education and Training Manager Rabbi Eliana Kayelle spoke powerfully to how LGBTQ Jews can find hope in these challenging times. “As a trans queer Jew this moment has me feeling the legacy of resilience deep in my bones. I’m thinking about Jewish ancestors. Miriam who, while under Pharaoh’s rule, held onto hope, planning for liberation by crafting instruments she would eventually use to dance out of Mitzrayim. Emma Goldman and Hannah Arendt, who remind me of the importance of action even when circumstances look bleak. These ancestors remind me that hope is not false optimism — it’s the desperate and powerful force that lives in our guts, the feeling that can move us to fight to repair a broken world.”

“I’m holding onto queer and trans ancestors and changemakers, especially trans women of color, drag queens and butches, who laid the groundwork for the queer liberation movement. The ones who became leaders because they had to. It is because of their work that I can shout: ‘I am here and I’m not going anywhere no matter how hard you try!’ I think of Miss Major Griffin-Gracy saying: ‘I don’t need their permission to exist; I exist in spite of them…we have a history, we have a reason to be here. We have a purpose.’ And I think: Yes.”

As President of Inter-Intra Community, Malik Johnson ministers to incarcerated Muslims, including those who identify as LGBTQ. “Someone might write in and say, ‘I’m a gay man who wants to be a part of the Muslim community in my [prison] facility, but I cannot because the others said that you cannot be gay and Muslim, and they will not let me pray with them. I feel very isolated from people and from the religion itself.’ Another might ask me, ‘What does it say in the Quran about me being trans?’”

“The beautiful thing is that the Quran doesn’t mention how queer a person has to be or not be to be sentenced to a heaven or a hell,” Johnson stated. “Instead the Quran relays [its message] in terms of action. What are your actions? What are you doing with your life? How are you treating other people?”

“Everyone has their own interpretation of what the Quran could mean. So I instead respond [to these questions] by addressing the heart. The first thing I say is ‘you matter.’ I say, ‘Thank you so much for calling or writing in. You are the most important part of this community. You mean so much. You’re very special. You’re worth something. If for no one else, you mean something to me. I love you and your Creator loves you. Because if your Creator didn’t love you, then they would not have created you and they would not have brought us together.’”

“You’re giving authority back to that person when you ask questions of them. Take someone who is trans. They have their dead name, that they used pre-transition, and they have their living name or preferred name. If that person is incarcerated, their dead name is continuously said to them. But if someone were to say, ‘What’s the name that you would like to be called?,’ it gives a symbol of hope and understanding and compassion. It gives back to that person so now that person is the authority in themselves. And that’s powerful. The best way to have autonomy is to name yourself.”

As we enter the holy season for those of so many faiths – from the end of Ramadan and Passover, to the start of Easter and Vaisakhi – let us remember these courageous leaders, who recognize our shared humanity and advocate for the importance of our diverse identities in fighting hate for all. In the words of the Interfaith Alliance, “While there are a variety of theological understandings of human sexuality and gender, we can all unite around the belief that nobody should fear for their safety or face discrimination based on who they love or who they are.”"
4/10/25,Research Explores How Trans Technologies are Removing Barriers to Access and Visibility,https://glaad.org/research-explores-how-trans-technologies-are-removing-barriers-to-access-and-visibility/,GLAAD,Jae Moore,Pro,7,"Trans Technologies, a new book from MIT Press and written by University of Michigan researcher and faculty member Oliver L. Haimson, Ph.D. explores the creative and novel ways technologies are being utilized to address the inequalities the transgender community faces, highlight and correct misinformation, and grow safety, acceptance, equitability, and visibility.

“Trans technologies,” as Haimson explains in the book (he also includes definitions from trans tech creators), are “built or adapted to address the specific concerns and needs of trans people and communities.” On a more theoretical level, trans technologies “embody or support themes or characteristics of transness.” Haimson uses a broad brush to paint his definition, adapting the concept to a wide variety of digital and analog applications “designed or adapted to help address some of the challenges transgender people face,” including basic needs such as access to society, employment, health care, and housing. Examples include, but are not limited to:

Apps – U-Signal, a prototype smartphone and smartwatch app to aid transgender people of color in identifying and reporting threats to their safety. The Safe Transgender Bathroom app (2021-22) helped trans people find safe/gender-neutral restrooms.
Maps – Trans activist and journalist Erin Reed created a map to assist trans people with finding health care providers who offer hormone therapy without requiring patients to obtain a letter of eligibility “from a therapist or psychiatrist.” Reed also created a map to identify legislative attacks against the transgender community in each state.
Websites – The Digital Transgender Archive offers a collection of historical transgender materials, including periodicals, news articles, photography.
Browser extensions – Deadname Remover updates “trans people’s previous names with their current ones,” while Gender Neutralize replaces gendered terms with “gender-neutral alternatives.”
Video games, augmented reality, and virtual reality – Through the Wardrobe uses augmented reality to empower “visitors [to] try out new identities via clothing and other artifacts.” Trans Fucking Rage Jam (2022) gave trans game developers the agency to channel their anger over anti-trans legislation into creative projects. Woven throughout the book, “care” and “ambivalence” serve as grounding forces, illustrating the (sometimes simultaneous) push and pull each trans tech creator faces in concepting and creating technology to meet their own individual needs or, more ideally, working with the broader transgender community, including people with multiple marginalized identities, to address one or more of the 14 categories of challenges transgender people face, as identified by Haimson and his team of researchers. The U-Signal prototype addresses “racial injustice,” for example, while the Safe Transgender Bathroom app targeted “access to society.” Another category, “pressure to educate cisgender people about trans identities,” includes The Trans Language Primer, a web site that defines more than 200 LGBTQ terms.

“Trans care” demonstrates the ways transgender people “show up for each other when society and family fail them.” Meanwhile, ambivalence, a word Haimson notes “has a particularly trans quality,” involves “two or more distant (maybe opposite) poles between which a person wavers and that they contemplate simultaneously.” For example, trans tech creators “have agency to create technology that addresses some trans needs,” but can’t solve the societal issues at the root of them – a moving target that continues to grow with each anti-LGBTQ executive order issued, law enacted, and the continued proliferation of hate speech online and in public settings.

Another ambivalence includes funding sources for trans technology: “capitalist and anticapitalist approaches, funders’ values and community values, paid work and volunteer work, profit and mutual aid,” among others. “While each of these pairs may seem like opposites,” Haimson explains, “in reality they are closer than they seem,” and may involve more than one approach.

Trans Technologies comes at a critical moment for the transgender community. Since assuming office in January, President Donald Trump has spent an outsize amount of time targeting transgender people and censoring evidence of their existence. These efforts include restricting federal websites from nearly 200 words used to describe marginalized people and communities, including LGBTQ, gender-affirming care, transgender, nonbinary, Black, race and racism, DEI, and yes, even the word “marginalized” itself.

Also at risk is important and life-saving academic research. President Trump’s recent anti-transgender executive orders have attempted to withdraw hundreds of research grants at several prominent educational institutions. In response, and to protect federal funding, universities throughout the country are scaling back or ending DEI efforts.

Haimson explained to GLAAD the cooling effect the Trump Administration’s harmful actions could have on future transgender research, including studies on the impact of trans technology on the community:

“The funding cuts to scientific research and universities will have tangible negative effects for so many marginalized groups, including trans people,” Haimson said.

“With the crackdown on ‘DEI’ research and the list of words that academics have been advised to no longer use in grant proposals, research that aims to improve trans people’s life chances is unlikely to be funded in the future (at least in the next four years). I have already seen my colleagues who are doing crucial trans health research have their NIH grant funding taken away, which means that we will have less knowledge about health disparities and action towards how to address them.”

Haimson warned that the absence of federal funding will require the support of trans folks “who typically have very little financial means and resources.”

Trans Technologies is the result of interviews with more than 100 English-speaking technology creators, 80 percent of whom are transgender and/or nonbinary. Haimson acknowledges this limitation in not including non-Western technologies and perspectives, and that he and many of his interviewees come from “relatively privileged” backgrounds in terms of education and socio-economic status. Regardless, Trans Technologies offers readers a thorough, yet approachable look at the types of technologies and their effects, both positive and negative, on transgender people and the trans community at large.

Trans Technologies can be purchased through most major booksellers. A digital edition of the book is also available at no cost on the MIT Press website."

3/24/2025,Election 2025: Wisconsin’s Supreme Court Candidates on the Record,https://glaad.org/election-2025-wisconsins-supreme-court-candidates-on-the-record/,GLAAD,Jae Moore,Pro,10,"Early voting has begun for the April 1 election for Wisconsin’s Supreme Court. Susan Crawford and Brad Schimel are running for a 10-year term. These are their records on LGBTQ issues: 

In response to the question from PBS Wisconsin, “Do trans people have any specific protections under the law? Are they a protected class? Do they get any other category of protection when it comes to them being singled out as a group?”

Crawford: “That is a question where if a case came in front of me, that was making an argument about the rights of transgender people or making a claim that they’d been discriminated against or something like that, I would have to look at the law and see what protections were available, and hear out what the attorney’s arguments were both for and against those kinds of protections. Obviously, look at the facts to see what was happening in that case. And then make a decision based on what I thought the facts and the law required.”
Schimel: “Under the law, they’re not in a particular protected class, no, but in a courtroom, in the justice system, you don’t have to be in a protected class to enjoy, to enjoy our constitutional rights. You know, I, I do name changes. Every Monday morning is when we hold name change hearings. And I have — it’s routine that I have individuals who have transitioned or are transitioning, want to change their names. I respect them for that decision, and I make those name changes as a matter of routine. I’ve even had some cases where they’ve undergone gender change operation and want to change their birth certificate. The law provides that they can do that. That’s what the law provides. My personal opinions have nothing to do with that.” Crawford’s LGBTQ history:

“Represented Planned Parenthood in challenging, along with the state and national ACLU, a 2013 law signed by Republican Gov. Scott Walker that required abortion providers to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals.” The ACLU noted “a federal judge blocked the law,” a decision that was upheld by a federal appeals court in both 2013 and 2015.
Called the 2022 overturning of Roe v. Wade “wrongly decided,” and noted it marked “the first time the court has ever taken away a right that was recognized and long vested under our United States Constitution.” Crawford said she found it “deeply concerning … when the government starts invading some of those fundamental decisions that men and women make every day about how to live their lives and what’s best for them and their families.”
In an interview with The Daily Cardinal (University of Wisconsin–Madison’s student newspaper), Crawford told young voters she is “looking to protect their rights under our Constitution and under our state laws and make sure that their fundamental freedoms are protected.” Referencing Brad Schimel’s remarks against reproductive freedom, she added, “I think young people should be concerned about a candidate who has an extreme position like that and is so willing to take rights away from people.”
In a guest column in The Cap Times, Crawford affirmed her commitment “to protecting the fundamental rights and freedoms of all Wisconsinites.” Drawing from her personal experience, Crawford said she “represented Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin and their doctors to protect women’s access to reproductive health care services.”
Said she prefers a “common sense” approach to reproductive rights rather than being labeled as “pro-choice,” a term she avoids “because of its policy implications and the way it’s been politicized.” Schimel’s LGBTQ history:

In 2014, while campaigning for attorney general, “Schimel pledged to defend Wisconsin’s ban on same-sex marriage and initially said he would refuse to uphold a 2009 state law granting domestic partnership benefits to same-sex couples.” Schimel later shifted his position on the latter, but remained committed “to enforcing the state’s same-sex marriage ban.”
Compared same-sex couples to Nazi skinheads in describing the religious exemption rights of Masterpiece Cakeshop plaintiff who fought to the U.S. Supreme Court to discriminate against a gay couple shopping for a wedding cake: “What if a person who is a minority owns a store and a couple of Nazi skinheads come in and demand that [the owner] provides a service?” Schimel said. “Can that person say no? I don’t know that they can if the Supreme Court decides that [the bakery owner] can be forced to make this cake.” 
As attorney general, hired Misha Tseytlin to be solicitor general. Tseytlin “played a central role in crafting the legal strategy to dismantle Roe v. Wade.” Schimel has an extensive record of attacks against reproductive freedom and once said Wisconsin has no “constitutional right to abortion.”
AP: Wisconsin taxpayers paid about $1,000 to send one of Schimel’s top lawyers to an event sponsored by Alliance Defending Freedom, a group with a long history of advocating against LGBTQ people and equality and a designated hate group by Southern Poverty Law Center. Schimel claimed the group only wants to make sure “LGBTQ+ rights did not interfere with the rights of other people.”
Accused the Wisconsin Supreme Court’s liberal, female majority of being “driven by their emotions” in determining whether to uphold the state’s 1849 abortion ban. “You could see it in their eyes, and you could hear it in the tone of their voice.”
At a recent campaign event in Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, Schimel sided with business owners who wished to use religious grounds to turn away LGBTQ couples. When an “attendee asked whether Schimel would do anything to protect ‘those of us who don’t want to hire or offer services’ to people whose marriages ‘violate our religious beliefs,’ Schimel responded, ‘Your religious rights need to be protected.’” In a 2017 interview with Wisconsin Eye, Schimel suggested that marriage equality could pave the way for LGBTQ couples to “take their right to be married and now infringe on the legitimate religious liberty beliefs or rights of a person who is an artist. This isn’t going down to the corner grocery store and buying a box of Ding Dongs. This is somebody who creates art.” In fact, the opposite happened: attempts at expanding religious exemptions to more scenarios to discriminate against LGBTQ people followed the narrow ruling in Masterpiece. Anti-LGBTQ legal group Alliance Defending Freedom reportedly shopped for plaintiffs to continue to challenge anti-discrimination laws in 303 Creative, featuring a web designer who had not been approached by any LGBTQ person or couple.
Expressed willingness to enforce a ban on marriage equality if the U.S. Supreme Court overturns Obergefell v. Hodges. At a campaign event in Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, Schimel said: “We have a constitutional amendment that’s still on the books.” Schimel previously explained his personal beliefs on marriage equality in an interview with Eye on Oshkosh in 2014, 18 months before the U.S. Supreme Court’s Obergefell decision legalized marriage equality nationwide: “As I do my job as attorney general, my personal view on that issue has no business entering into the equation. My job as the state’s lawyer is to defend Wisconsin’s law … until the Supreme Court says it’s unconstitutional or the people change it. So, you start with that, but my view is I favor traditional marriage: one man, one woman. That’s my personal view in my personal life, and that’s how I voted when the marriage amendment was on the ballot. Now, that doesn’t mean that I don’t accept that people of the same sex can be deeply in love with each other, and committed to each other. I wonder whether the government ought to be in the marriage business at all, and whether we ought to leave that to religion and other things.”
Criticized transgender singer Laura Jane Grace, who opened a Wisconsin rally held by Sen. Bernie Sanders with a performance of “Your God.” Schimel said the song was an “absolutely grotesque attack on people of faith.” 
Ran an anti-transgender ad campaign featuring a parent accusing Susan Crawford of supporting the “radical agenda” of special interests. “Let transitioning males use my girls’ bathrooms at school? Allow boys to compete against them in sports? Giving puberty-blocking drugs to children without parents’ consent? That’s who Susan Crawford sides with.”
Refused to comment on anti-transgender text messages from “Win Wisconsin, Win the Future,” a group which is not “registered with the state, the Federal Election Commission or the Internal Revenue Service.” The texts ask if “parents should have the right to know if their child is transitioning genders at school” and warn “ISSUES LIKE THIS COULD BE DECIDED BY THE WI SUPREME COURT.”
Fair Wisconsin, the state’s only statewide LGBTQ+ civil rights and political advocacy organization, issued a statement on the election: “Brad Schimel would be a dangerous addition to the Wisconsin Supreme Court because he poses a threat to our rights, both for the rights of Wisconsinites in general and for the LGBTQ+ community in particular. Schimel has recently launched an anti-trans attack ad, and I find his cynical attempt to sow fear by preying on our trans friends, family, and neighbors in Wisconsin absolutely disgusting. As I have said before in the face of anti-trans attacks, we cannot let these ugly ads work. People are not issues; children are not weapons; health care, safety, and support are for everyone. Every bill passed into law, and every decision made by a court has an impact on the LGBTQ+ community, and that is why we need to have a court we can rely on to protect our rights as Wisconsinites, including LGBTQ+ Wisconsinites – our rights to safety, health, and the freedom to live as our authentic selves and love who we love.”

GLAAD statement: “All elections are a chance for voters to use their voices, and the Wisconsin Supreme Court race is one with a ten-year impact on LGBTQ people as well as fairness and impartiality. Voters can review the LGBTQ records of the candidates to understand how they will defend or dismantle protections for LGBTQ people, as well as reproductive rights. The election on April 1 will have a profound and lasting influence on the safety and equality of all Wisconsinites.”

The court is expected to decide the future of abortion in the state and could redraw a congressional map. 

In addition, there is a proposed constitutional amendment on the ballot that seeks to embed Wisconsin’s voter ID law into the state constitution. Wisconsin currently requires voters to present their photo ID in person at the polls.

According to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, “The referendum isn’t asking whether to get rid of or keep that law. It’ll remain in place regardless of the referendum results.” Instead, it seeks to permanently add the voter ID law into the state constitution.
Crawford previously expressed opposition to the law and called it “draconian,” but declined to share how she would vote. Schimel is in favor of the state’s voter ID law and said he would support the resolution.
Strict voter ID laws can create barriers for transgender people, “both because of difficulties in obtaining an ID that’s accepted, or because they might run into bias or misunderstandings of the law when it comes to their gender.”
Unelected billionaire Elon Musk has endorsed Schimel and donated to groups that have reportedly spent more than $10 million in ads against Schimel’s opponent, Susan Crawford (including one that used a photo of the wrong individual to represent Crawford). Investigative reporters have noted that the groups have posted Facebook ads making false claims about Crawford’s position on cash bail. Crawford has not taken a position on cash bail.

The GLAAD ALERT Desk (Anti-LGBTQ Extremism Reporting Tracker) has documented 47 anti-LGBTQ incidents in Wisconsin since June 2022, including three bomb threats, three cases of vandalism, and two assaults. Examples include:

On Feb. 1, 2025, an individual mailed anti-LGBTQ letters to an LGBTQ person / former pastor at their home in Oak Creek, Wisconsin. The letters addressed the victim, calling them a “queer piece of sh*t.”
Starting on March 8, 2024, at least four bomb threats were called into Butler Middle School in Waukesha, Wisconsin. The threats followed a post by Libs of TikTok four days prior, which showed a school employee posting about his partner and saying: “Acceptance, equity and inclusion should be cornerstones of our schools.”
(TW) On Feb. 26, 2023, an individual shot and killed a transgender woman at her apartment in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The perpetrator allegedly filmed her death while making anti-trans comments."

04.15.2025  Sent a memo to lawmakers requesting that Congress rescind $1.1 billion in federal funding from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which contributes money to NPR and PBS. The funding is already appropriated by Congress. Public broadcasters like NPR and PBS have a track record of airing programming that highlights LGBTQ stories, issues, and communities,  providing representation and education often not found on commercial networks. The White House memo advocating for the cuts specifically criticized PBS for airing programs featuring transgender characters.

04.04.2025  Issued a proclamation recognizing National Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month that erroneously claims that assaults by undocumented immigrants are one of the leading causes of sexual violence. In fact, eight out of 10 rapes are committed by someone known to the victim, according to data from the Department of Justice. Previous proclamations emphasized support for survivors and perpetrator accountability. Trump was found liable for sexual abuse in 2023. 

04.04.2025  Created a new Title IX Special Investigations Team focused on preventing transgender women and girls from women’s and girls’ sports teams and restrooms. The Departments of Education and Justice jointly said that this team will “protect students, and especially female athletes, from the pernicious effects of gender ideology in school programs and activities.” Title IX was enacted by Congress in 1972 to protect students from discrimination “on the basis of sex.” NCAA President Charlie Baker testified in December 2024 that he knows of fewer than ten transgender college student athletes among 510,000 athletes total.

04.04.2025  Targeted transgender people and health care in a proclamation declaring April National Child Abuse Prevention Month. The proclamation is defamatory and without basis and betrays the month’s purpose. Trump’s proclamation singled out transgender care, and without basis, called it a form of child abuse. The proclamation does not address the most common risk factors for neglected or abused children.Transgender people exist, and every major medical association and leading world health authority supports health care for transgender people and youth.   

03.24.2025  Announced attempt to terminate at least 68 grants to 46 institutions, many of which were for research on the health of LGBTQ people. The grants totaled nearly $40 million when awarded and are funded through Congressional budget appropriation, which the executive branch does not control. Most were in some way related to LGBTQ health, including research on HIV prevention. Other canceled studies centered on cancer, youth suicide, and bone health. The AP reports that, “One canceled project at Vanderbilt University had been following the overall health of more than 1,200 LGBTQ people age 50 and older.… ‘We now no longer have anywhere studying LGBT cancer in the United States,’” a researcher noted.

03.15.2025 Shut down the 83-year-old Voice of America (VOA) asserting that the venerable international broadcasting state media network had distributed “radical propaganda,” citing a March 2019 segment about transgender migrants seeking asylum in the United States. The Washington Post‘s fact checker described this as an “ordinary news story” that was produced during the first Trump administration. The Trump administration has shut down VOA and other U.S.-funded media by placing nearly all staff on administrative leave and terminating contracts with affiliated broadcasters, effectively silencing operations that had promoted democracy globally for decades.

03.07.2025 Signed an executive order directing administration officials to modify the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program to exclude nonprofit organizations engaged in activities he baselessly described as having a “substantial illegal purpose.” The order to limit the program is aimed at organizations supporting immigrants, diversity initiatives, or transgender care for youth.

03.07.2025 The Department of Defense is reportedly flagging content for removal via keyword search including “gay,” meaning references to the Enola Gay, an airplane that dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima, Japan, would be scrubbed. The AP reports the “vast majority of the Pentagon purge targets women and minorities, including notable milestones made in the military. And it also removes a large number of posts that mention various commemorative months—such as those for Black and Hispanic people and women.” Additional content flagged includes a photo of an Army Corps of Engineer that had an engineer with the last name Gay, and a photo of Army Corps biologists “seemingly because it mentioned they were recording data about fish—including their weight, size, hatchery and gender.”

03.04.2025 Falsely claimed in his Address to Congress that he “brought back free speech in America.” In fact, his administration has aggressively censored LGBTQ people and identities in executive orders, from federal websites, in health care, and from the Stonewall National Monument website. 

03.04.2025 Made the dangerous and misleading claim that $8 million in taxpayer dollars were going towards creating “transgender mice.” In fact, this baseless claim comes from a far-right watchdog group. Transgenic mice are lab research mice that have been genetically altered to better model human disease response. They have been called a “revolutionary research resource” for medical advancements in asthma and cancer among other areas. 

03.04.2025 Falsely claimed the USA was giving “$8 million to promote LGBTQI+ in the African nation of Lesotho, which nobody has ever heard of.” In fact, the U.S. government does not support LGBTQ initiatives in Lesotho, but it does promote widely used health programs, particularly HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment. Trump has previously disparaged African countries and Haiti.

03.04.2025 Touted his executive orders banning transgender women from sports and cited anti-transgender advocate Payton McNabb, a former volleyball player injured during a match against an alleged trans player. In fact, more than 214,000 female student athletes have been injured playing volleyball since 2012, with the vast majority of accidents involving cisgender players.

03.06.2025 Marked Women’s History Month with a proclamation from the U.S. Embassy in Romania. The proclamation cited Trump administration policies that impinge on the right of some people to have passports that accurately reflect their gender identities, to restrict some women from participating in sports, and to seek to define “sex” in a way that excludes transgender women from the protections of civil rights laws. Trump’s own history with women includes nominating the Supreme Court justices who helped overturn the federal protections of Roe, and a jury found Trump liable for sexually abusing E. Jean Carroll in 1996, awarding her $5 million. In a leaked 2005 Access Hollywood tape, Trump was recorded bragging about kissing and groping women without their consent. Trump defended several political allies accused of sexual misconduct or domestic abuse, including his first nominee for Attorney General Matt Gaetz, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., and Education Secretary Linda McMahon who is accused of enabling child sex assault when she led the WWE. More than 40 women have publicly accused Trump of various forms of sexual misconduct since the 1970s.

02.19.2025 Rolled out a new HHS webpage, titled “Protecting Women and Children,” that employs Trump’s narrow and scientifically baseless definition of sex and asserts that gender-affirming care is a form of child abuse. The department is promoting a rigid definition of sex that excludes transgender identities, falsely framing gender-affirming care as “chemical and surgical mutilation” and targeting trans inclusion in sports. In fact, every major medical association and leading world health authority supports health care for transgender people and youth. The site section titled “Keeping Men Out of Women’s Sports,” repeats far-right rhetoric used to justify bans on transgender women athletes. 

02.18.2025 Added a baseless disclaimer to the top of government websites for the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control, and the Health and Human Services after a federal judge ordered that web pages that contained vital information about trans people and other marginalized groups be reinstated. The pages were posted again with a false header that reads, “Any information on this page promoting gender ideology is extremely inaccurate and disconnected from the immutable biological reality that there are two sexes, male and female… The Trump Administration rejects gender ideology and condemns the harms it causes to children, by promoting their chemical and surgical mutilation, and to women, by depriving them of their dignity, safety, well-being, and opportunities. This page does not reflect biological reality and therefore the Administration and this Department reject it.” The statement is false and contradicts global medical standards defining gender and sex. Transgender people exist. Every major medical association and leading world health authority supports health care for transgender people and youth.  

02.14.2025 National Park Service removes the word “transgender” from the Stonewall National Monument website. Transgender people were central in the Stonewall Riots and remain essential in the past, present and future of the LGBTQ movement.

02.10.2025 Signed an executive order to target mainstream essential health care for transgender youth, using inaccurate and inflammatory graphic language. The care is supported by every major medical association and has been prescribed for decades, including throughout the first Trump administration. The order was blocked by a federal judge and prohibits federal agencies from conditioning or withholding federal funding based on the fact that a healthcare entity or professional provides gender-affirming medical care to a patient under nineteen.

02.10.2025 Removed “T” from State Department travel advisory website which now only offers guidance for “LGB” travelers.

02.07.2025 Department of Justice directs federally-funded nonprofit organizations including the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) to remove references to transgender people from public materials. The Verge reported that three reports previously on the NCMEC website had become inaccessible, each of which mentioned LGBTQ people. LGBTQ youth are among the most vulnerable to housing insecurity, violence, and abuse.

02.04.2025 Paused foreign development assistance, including HIV drug supply to USAID-supported countries. Marco Rubio, as Secretary of State, has been put in charge of USAID while Pete Marocco, a Trump appointee, manages the defunding and dismantling of USAID programs. USAID supported HIV treatment and prevention programs, including PEPFAR, which provided lifesaving treatment to millions of people in 54 countries. In addition to HIV programs, USAID supported the rights of LGBTQ people in Dominican Republic, Uganda, Bangladesh, Kosovo, and Guatemala, and worked with LGBTQ populations across Central Asia, the Middle East, and North Africa.

02.04.2025 Froze applications for the gender-neutral “X” marker on U.S. passports. The option had been added in 2021 by the Biden administration. Several countries worldwide already offer options other than male and female on official documents. India, Pakistan and Nepal already have a nonbinary option, and  the Netherlands issued its first gender-neutral passport in 2018.

02.02.2025 Directed schools to stop using federal funding for purposes related to “gender ideology.” Transgender people are real, and not an ideology. More here on the origins of the phrase used to dehumanize trans people.

01.27.2025 Signed an executive order directing the Secretary of Defense to reinstate a ban on transgender people serving in the military. This policy prohibits transgender people from enlisting, bars currently serving transgender personnel from transitioning, and ends the use of authentic pronouns. The order revokes Biden’s policies that had allowed transgender troops to serve openly and access transition-related medical care and reversed protections for LGBTQ people in military service, education, housing, and federal employment.

01.23.2025 Moved some transgender women in prisons to administrative isolation and mandated that transgender women prisoners be detained in men’s prisons. 

01.23.2025 Falsely claimed, among multiple baseless claims and wild exaggerations in a speech to global leaders at the World Economic Forum, that “there are only two genders, male and female. And we will have no men participating in women’s sports and transgender operations, which became the rage, will occur very rarely.” Facts: Science and medicine as well as cultures throughout history have long acknowledged wider diversity of gender. Transgender women are women, and sometimes play sports. “Transgender operations” are already quite rare.

01.20.2025 Signed an executive order revoking multiple Biden-era policies. This order revoked an executive order that addressed discrimination based on gender identity or sexual orientation. 

01.20.2025 Ordered an end to Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) programs across the federal government, putting such staff on immediate administrative leave.

01.20.2025 The Trump administration has eliminated nearly all LGBTQ and HIV focused content and resources from the White House website, as well as eliminated LGBTQ and HIV content from key federal agency webpages. Mentions of “lesbian,” “bisexual,” “gay,” “transgender,” “sexual orientation,” “gender identity,” and related terms are no longer accessible on WhiteHouse.gov, and the search term “LGBTQ” now brings up zero results on the site. In addition, some LGBTQ-specific pages have been taken down from the Centers for Disease Control, Department of State, and more. 

01.20.2025 Signed an executive order declaring that the federal government would recognize only two immutable sexes: male and female. The order aims to  prevent taxpayer funds from being used for gender-transition health care and add “privacy in intimate spaces” in facilities such as prisons, migrant shelters and rape shelters. In fact, the development of the human body is a complex process, and sex is not solely determined by anatomy, nor is it strictly binary. As many as 1.7% of people are born with an intersex trait.

2024
10.28.2024 Repeatedly referred to CNN’s Anderson Cooper as “Allison” at a rally in Michigan when Cooper’s town hall with Vice President Kamala Harris came up. The anti-LGBTQ and misogynistic rhetoric evokes the trope of gay men as effeminate, suggesting that gay men are women and that being a woman is degrading.

10.13.2024 Aired a anti-transgender campaign ad that pictured Vice President Kamala Harris superimposed with transgender members of the Biden administration and a scene lifted from the television show Orange Is the New Black of inmates in prison jumpsuits. “Kamala supports taxpayer funded sex changes for prisoners and illegal aliens. Kamala is for they/them. President Trump is for you.” The assertion echoes a statement Trump made in the presidential debate with Harris: “Now she wants to do transgender operations on illegal aliens that are in prison.” In fact, by law the government must provide medical care to prisoners and immigrant detainees. During Trump’s presidency, officials at the Bureau of Prisons, which operates under the Justice Department, facilitated transgender health care for a limited number of incarcerated individuals who sought such care. This policy was implemented throughout Trump’s four-year term, despite his administration’s public stance on transgender issues.

09.10.24. In the presidential debate Trump said, “Now [Kamala Harris] wants to do transgender operations on illegal aliens that are in prison.” In fact, by law the government must provide medical care to prisoners and immigrant detainees. During Trump’s presidency, officials at the Bureau of Prisons, which operates under the Justice Department, facilitated transgender health care for a limited number of incarcerated people who sought such care. This policy was implemented during Trump’s term.

09.04.2024 Lied about access to gender-affirming care for minors, saying at a Moms for Liberty summit, “Think of it, your kid goes to school and comes home a few days later with an operation….The school decides what’s going to happen with your child.” The statement is a false, gross misrepresentation of the highly regulated process of transgender health care for minors in the United States. No children are going to school and receiving surgery there for gender dysphoria.

08.02.2024 In an interview at The National Association of Black Journalists conference he falsely questioned Vice President Kamala Harris‘ racial identity, claiming she “happened to turn Black” a few years ago and suggesting she previously only promoted her Indian heritage. The lie echos his previous racist remarks, such as the “birther” conspiracy theories he promoted against former President Barack Obama.

07.18.2024 During 90-minute nomination acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention, he repeats baseless disinformation about transgender women and girls participating in sports. GLAAD’s Voter Poll shows a majority of voters in all parties oppose “a political candidate [who] speaks frequently about restricting access to health care and participation in sports for transgender youth.”

07.10.2024  Campaign website includes formal policy plans called “Agenda 47” that includes a pledge titled “President Trump’s Plan to Protect Children From Left-Wing Gender Insanity.” The Advocate reports, “Trump promised to outlaw gender-affirming care for minors at the federal level, and ‘cease all programs that promote the concept of sex and gender transition at any age.’ He also promised to ban transgender athletes from competing on teams that match their gender identity.… Trump stated that he ‘will ask Congress to pass a bill establishing that the only genders recognized by the United States government are male and female — and they are assigned at birth.’ He then claimed that being transgender was ‘invented’ by the ‘radical left,’ though he did not use the term ‘transgender’ once throughout Agenda 47.”

06.21.24  Announced that if elected for a second term, he would cut federal funding for inclusive schools: “On day one, I will sign a new executive order to cut Federal funding of any school pushing critical race theory, transgender insanity, and other inappropriate racial, sexual, or political content onto the lives of our children.” He also announced his intent to target transgender people in sports.

05.17.2024 Recommitted to criminalizing abortion, telling Time that he would not intervene in decisions to monitor or prosecute pregnant people. He refused to say whether his second administration would enforce the Comstock Act, an 1873 “zombie law” that bans the mailing of “obscene” materials, including birth control and “instruments” used for abortions. The act has been unenforceable for the past 50 or so years, largely because it was rendered unconstitutional by Roe v. Wade, which Trump has repeatedly taken credit for overturning.

05.14.2024 Vowed to roll back Title IX protections for transgender student enacted in April 2024 by the U.S. Department of Education “on day one,” if he’s reelected. Trump said: “We’re going to end it on day one. Don’t forget, that was done as an order from the president. That came down as an executive order. And we’re going to change it—on day one it’s going to be changed…. It’ll be terminated.”

04.08.2024 Stated his current position on abortion on his social media platform in a video saying, “My view is now that we have abortion where everyone wanted it from a legal standpoint, the states will determine by vote or legislation, or perhaps both. And whatever they decide must be the law of the land. In this case, the law of the state.” In the same video he made the baseless claim that Democrats want to legalize the “execution” of babies that were already born, which is not true. Trump’s position on abortion rights has changed many times from saying he is “very pro-choice” in 1999, to personally taking credit for overturning Roe vs. Wade in 2022, to saying Florida’s six-week abortion ban is “a terrible mistake” in 2023, to saying he would “be open” to a 15 week ban in 2024.

04.04.2024 Announced he would declare November 5 to be “Christian Visibility Day” after a baseless complaint about Transgender Day of Visibility coinciding with Easter in 2024. Previously Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt issued a statement calling it “appalling and insulting” that Biden “formally proclaimed Easter Sunday as ‘Trans Day of Visibility.’ ”

03.16.2024 Defended Ohio Senate primary candidate Bernie Moreno, whose email address was used to create an account on Adult Friend Finder in 2008 seeking “men for 1-on-1 sex.” Moreno’s campaign said the account was created by an intern as a prank. Trump defended Moreno and claimed “Democratic fake treatment” for the story Moreno’s campaign had confirmed: “We all know this man. He’s a hero, he’s a winner and we’re not going to let these people — these people are sick.”

03.16.2024 Appeared at a campaign rally for Ohio Senate primary candidate Bernie Moreno, sponsored by the pro-Moreno Buckeye Values PAC. The PAC released an ad targeting a Moreno rival as “a champion for trans equality.” The PAC also reportedly sent campaign mail asking “What Team Does Frank LaRose Play For?” and “Is he with us … Or is he with they/them?”

03.04.2024 Endorsed North Carolina Lt. Governor Mark Robinson for governor, despite Robinson’s history of anti-LGBTQ disinformation and rhetoric, including calling gay people “filth” and “maggots.” Trump repeated his past claims that Robinson is “better than Martin Luther King” and “Martin Luther King on steroids.” 

02.02.2024 Used vulgar slang to refer to LGBTQ legal icon Roberta Kaplan, who represented E. Jean Carroll against Trump. Trump was found liable for sexually abusing Carroll in the 1990s and for defaming her by mocking her claims after he left the White House. A jury awarded Carroll with $83 million in damages. Kaplan recalled leading the deposition of Trump, saying that at the end Trump’s lawyers asked to go “off the record,” meaning what he said would not be included on the court deposition transcript. Kaplan said Trump then said to her: “See you next Tuesday,” a slang term referring to a word for female genitalia used as an insult for women.

02.20.2024 Supported by the anti-LGBTQ national organization Heritage Foundation with a 180-page document detailing regulations and executive orders to be taken in first days in office, including: “deleting [from federal agencies and federal rule] the terms sexual orientation and gender identity (“SOGI”), diversity, equity, and inclusion., gender, gender equality, gender equity, gender awareness, gender-sensitive, abortion, reproductive health, reproductive rights;” limiting abortion access with executive orders using the Comstock Act — a long-inactive 19th century law that banned birth control and abortion medication by mail. Semafor reported: While Project 2025 bills itself as being “candidate agnostic,” [project director Paul] Dans noted that at this point in the primary, they expect “and hope” that Donald Trump will ultimately end up in office again. NBC News reported that Project 2025 includes representatives from anti-LGBTQ, anti-equality and anti-democracy groups “led by veterans of the Trump administration, such as America First Legal, the Center for Renewing America and the Conservative Partnership Institute, the Claremont Institute, the Family Research Council and the Independent Women’s Forum.” (Links to groups added by GLAAD).

01.10.2024 Boasted of his role in the Supreme Court decision ending the right to abortion by nominating three of the justices who joined the decision: “If it weren’t for me, with Roe v. Wade, you wouldn’t even be talking about this stuff. For 54 years they were trying to get Roe v. Wade terminated, and I did it and I’m proud to have done it,” Trump said. Abortion is an LGBTQ issue: LGBTQ people can and do get pregnant, lesbian young women are two to ten times more likely to become pregnant than heterosexual youth, lesbian and bisexual women are often at higher risk of sexual assault due in part to their sexual orientation, which may also result in an unplanned pregnancy. 

2023
12.30.2023 Criticized Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine for vetoing state bill banning essential health care for transgender youth and banning trans youth from school sports, spread disinformation about the care and school sports. DeWine had said his veto was based on conversations he had with parents, patients and providers who told him how the care saves lives. Trump said in a Truth Social post: “DeWine has fallen to the Radical Left… What was he thinking. The bill would have stopped child mutilation, and prevented men from playing in women’s sports. Legislature will hopefully overturn. Do it FAST!!!” Ohio hospitals and providers, along with hundreds of others, had testified that they do not perform surgeries on youth, and Ohio’s school sports association has long had policies to ensure inclusive participation of transgender students.

12.17.2023 Announced on social media, “On Day One [of a second term if he were reelected President], I will sign a new executive order to cut federal funding for any school pushing Critical Race Theory, transgender insanity, and other inappropriate racial, sexual, or political content on our children…”

11.03.2023 Mimicked a Canadian weightlifter in an extended campaign event skit to mock and misgender transgender women in sports, claiming he will “end this on day one” if he’s re-elected.

09.13.2023 In “Agenda47: President Trump’s Ten Principles For Great Schools Leading To Great Jobs” on Trump’s campaign web site, he disparaged transgender people and includes misinformation about gender in eight of the ten principles. The Agenda targets LGBTQ people, particularly transgender people, by opposing gender-affirming care, restricting teachers from supporting transgender students, defining gender strictly as binary and assigned at birth, and eliminating LGBTQ-inclusive curricula. These policies aim to remove recognition and support for transgender identities in education and healthcare while promoting a restrictive view of gender and sexuality.

05.17.2023 Proudly stated, “I was able to kill Roe v. Wade,” taking credit for the Supreme Court overturning the national right to an abortion in the Dobbs decision. The Dobbs decision suggested that the right to same-sex marriage should be reconsidered by the Court as well. 

06.11.2023 Said of transgender athletes at a rally, “Who would even think that you can allow this? Who would say that this is okay? These people are sick. They are deranged…. It’s astonishing how passionately people react to that. When you talk about tax cuts, they remain calm. But when you mention transgender issues, everyone goes wild. Who would have imagined five years ago that they wouldn’t even know what ‘it’ meant?”

04.14.2023 Said that if re-elected, he would use the government to investigate and potentially halt transgender health care during a National Rifle Association (NRA) speech. “Upon my inauguration, I will direct the FDA to convene an independent outside panel to investigate whether transgender hormone treatments and ideology increase the risk of extreme depression, aggression and even violence,” said Trump. He also accused Democrats of “pushing the transgender cult” on children.

03.26.2023 Vowed to crack down on “transgender insanity” and pledged to “revoke every Biden policy promoting the disfigurement of our youth” at the first rally of his 2024 presidential campaign. He said that he would “keep men out of women’s sports” if re-elected president, after he last year misgendered transgender athlete Lia Thomas. He added: “I will immediately sign an executive order to cut federal funding for any school pushing critical race theory, transgender insanity, and other racial, sexual or political content on our children.”

01.31.2023 Made multiple false claims about gender affirming care, tweeting a so-called “Plan to Protect Children from Left-Wing Gender Insanity.“ Every major medical association and world health authority supports gender affirming care; statements here including from the American Academy of Pediatrics: “There is strong consensus among the most prominent medical organizations worldwide that evidence-based, gender-affirming care for transgender children and adolescents is medically necessary and appropriate. It can even be lifesaving. The decision of whether and when to start gender-affirming treatment, which does not necessarily lead to hormone therapy or surgery, is personal and involves careful consideration by each patient and their family.”

01.29.2023 At a campaign event, falsely claimed and without evidence or fact: “We’re going to stop the left-wing radical racists and perverts who are trying to indoctrinate our youth, and we’re going to get their Marxist hands off our children…We’re going to defeat the cult of gender ideology and reaffirm that God created two genders: men and women. We’re not going to allow men to play women’s sports.”

01.26.2023 Released so-called education policy that cuts federal funding for any school or program that includes “critical race theory, gender ideology, or other inappropriate racial, sexual, or political content onto our children.”"
3/20/2025,LGBTQ Alabamians and Our History Will Not Be Erased,https://glaad.org/lgbtq-alabamians-and-our-history-will-not-be-erased/,GLAAD,Jose Vasquez,Pro,4,"Freedom has never been a passive gift. It is a fight we carry forward, generation after generation.

Living in Alabama, I’m aware that every right we enjoy was won by the people—not simply granted by lawmakers. Black elders in Montgomery remind us that the Montgomery Bus Boycott wasn’t just a symbolic protest—it was 381 days of relentless organizing, sacrifice, and resistance. These histories are blueprints for our movements today, and we need them now more than ever.

As a volunteer for Montgomery Pride United, I have witnessed how the LGBTQ movement is sustained by elders who survived bar crackdowns, led revolutionary marches, and endured the HIV/AIDS crisis. And now, we’re seeing the state of Alabama work to intentionally suppress this crucial history.

On the federal level, under the current Administration, LGBTQ people are facing an aggressive, coordinated effort to censor our stories and restrict equal access to public life. Currently,  456 anti-LGBTQ bills have been introduced across the United States. Here’s what is at stake in Alabama:

House Bill 4 introduces the vague term “gender-oriented conduct” into the state obscenity law—an intentional tactic to ban books about queer and trans people from public libraries.
House Bill 67 is a drag ban also designed to target and criminalize innocent trans people for simply existing in schools or libraries.
House Bill 244 expands “Don’t Say Gay” through 12th grade, further isolating queer and trans youth while censoring free speech, LGBTQ history, and the contributions of queer and trans leaders from classrooms.
House Bill 246, the “Pronoun Bill,” would prohibit public school, college, and university employees from using a student’s name or pronouns without explicit written parental permission.
The inaccurate and harmful act ignoring the existence of intersex, transgender, and nonbinary people , was recently signed by Governor Ivey. It enshrines medically inaccurate definitions of “male” and “female”and aims to block people from their own accurate identity documents and justifies bathroom restrictions that are vague and dangerously enforced. This bill takes effect on October 1.
Anti-LGBTQ bills have emboldened extremists on the ground in Alabama.

These bills are not just targeting LGBTQ people, they are a direct attack on First Amendment freedoms. When Alabama lawmakers passed an anti-DEI law last year, a Black Student Union was forced to give up its meeting space, excluding Black students from necessary and safe places to find community. These actions are part of a broader strategy to roll back civil rights and silence those who challenge systemic oppression. In 2023, lawmakers threatened the Alabama Department of Archives and History’s budget for inviting Invisible Histories, a community archive organization, to present a lecture on Alabama’s rich, and too often untold, LGBTQ History. Since 2024, we have seen an increase in challenged and banned books across public libraries – including The Pronoun Book, The Meaning of Pride, The Hate U Give, and Being You: a First Conversation about Gender. Our local LGBTQ community center, managed by Montgomery Pride United, has also heard from many queer teens that they fear repercussions by teachers and students alike for being themselves. This onslaught of oppressive laws is meant to make life harder for queer and transgender people in the state.

But here’s what lawmakers fail to understand: LGBTQ people are not leaving Alabama. No amount of hateful legislation will erase us. We are active in our communities, schools, churches, and in every facet of public life across the state. Our history is our power. And right now, lawmakers are not just trying to ban books—they are trying to deny we exist online and in real life. You can help ensure this never happens by joining the collective effort to preserve LGBTQ histories, both digitally and physically, by signing up with Invisible Histories, a community-based archive working with LGBTQ organizations across the South to protect the legacy of LGBTQ Alabamians and help safeguard the online records of DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) programs set to be eliminated because of the President’s executive order. We’ve survived attacks against LGBTQ people before, and this time, we have the tools to protect our history. Our elders were battle-tested, building movements from the ground up and laying the foundation for the social progress we no longer can take for granted. It is our turn to ensure their wisdom and resilience are imparted to future generations. LGBTQ Alabamians shouldn’t have to leave home to thrive, and those intent on making life intolerable for the most marginalized in our state should never be in the majority."
2/28/2025,New York Times Removes Mention of Transgender Man from Headline,https://glaad.org/new-york-times-removes-mention-of-transgender-man-from-headline/,GLAAD,None listed,Pro,4,"In mid-February, news broke of the horrific murder of transgender man Sam Nordquist, in New York. We here at GLAAD stand in solidarity with Sam’s loved ones as they demand justice. News of Sam’s death and the now seven individuals charged in connection with his death was picked up by media in New York, Sam’s home state of Minnesota, and nationally.

The New York Times, an outlet with a pattern of bias and inaccuracies within their coverage of transgender people, also covered the story. One Times article caught the eye of many LGBTQ people and allies, posted February 15th with a headline calling Sam a trans man, which is an accurate description of Sam. On February 16th, the headline was changed from trans man to man. Late that same day, the headline was again changed, this time from man to person. Sam and all victims of violence deserve accurate coverage of their lives. At a time when trans people and the word trans are literally being erased from government websites due to hate and anti-trans violence is increasing, Sam’s identity as a man who was trans must not be hidden behind generic language.

Why did the Times change their headline about Sam? Many LGBTQ people and allies wondered the same thing. All of these headline changes are available to view directly here at the Internet Archive, which archives webpages.

One additional article about Sam was published in the Times, on February 17th. It appears that the online headline of that story included transgender man from publish time to present (as of February 26th), and the descriptor transgender man was a part of the print headline too.

GLAAD and 100+ organizations and leaders have been calling out the Times’ pattern of inaccurate, biased trans coverage since February 2023. The coalition recently placed a mobile billboard in front of Times’ offices requesting a meeting between leaders from the trans community and Times staff. Requests for this meeting date back longer than two years, to which the Times has not yet responded.

2/13/2025,"Missouri AG’s Lawsuit Aims to Undo Protections for LGBTQ Youth, Defends Harmful Practice of Conversion Therapy, as Local LGBTQ Advocates Respond",https://glaad.org/missouri-attorney-general-lawsuit-lgbtq-youth-conversion-therapy-advocates-respond/,GLAAD,Tony Morrison,Pro,2 or 3,"In a shameless and alarming move, Missouri Attorney General, Andrew Bailey, this week filed a lawsuit to reverse the protective bans on conversion therapy in Kansas City and Jackson County.

This legal battle threatens to expose LGBTQ youth in the state to discredited, dangerous practices that have long been debunked by medical professionals and mental health experts.

Conversion therapy, an attempt to “change” someone’s sexual orientation or gender identity, has caused irreparable harm to countless LGBTQ individuals.

Justice Horn, a former chair of Kansas City’s LGBTQ Commission, GLAAD Media Institute alum, and an outspoken activist, was instrumental in securing the passage of the Kansas City and Jackson County conversion therapy bans.

He called the Attorney General’s lawsuit a dangerous step backwards: “By attempting to legalize child abuse, this lawsuit not only threatens the safety of LGBTQ youth, but also sends a message that their lives are expendable,” Horn said.

“We will fight, we will resist, and we will protect our LGBTQ youth—because their lives, their safety, and their futures are non-negotiable.” The lawsuit, filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri, targets both the Kansas City and Jackson County governments, challenging local ordinances passed in 2019 and 2023, respectively. These ordinances, which have overwhelming bipartisan support, were passed with one clear goal: to protect children and teenagers from conversion therapy—a harmful practice that has been repeatedly condemned by every major medical and mental health organization in the U.S.

Since Kansas City passed its ban in 2019, and Jackson County followed suit in 2023, these ordinances have represented a crucial step in affirming the right of LGBTQ people, particularly youth, to live authentically and free from coercion or abuse. They reflect an understanding that conversion therapy causes devastating harm, contributing to depression, anxiety, homelessness, and tragically, suicide. Studies show that 25% of LGBTQ youth who had undergone conversion therapy had attempted suicide within the previous 12 months—a stark reminder of the irreversible damage these practices cause.

According The Trevor Project, nearly 1 in 3 LGBTQ young people said their mental health was poor most of the time or always due to anti-LGBTQ policies and legislation, including conversion therapy.

The legal challenge by Missouri’s Attorney General could have devastating consequences for LGBTQ youth, who are already at higher risk for mental health struggles and violence. Experts agree that rather than helping individuals, conversion therapy compounds the emotional and psychological trauma faced by LGBTQ people, particularly young people who are still finding their identity.

In the face of these efforts to roll back protections, the LGBTQ+ community is standing firm. Advocates are doubling down on their commitment to protecting LGBTQ+ youth, ensuring that harmful practices like conversion therapy have no place in Missouri—and beyond.

This fight isn’t just about one city or one county—it’s about the rights of LGBTQ people everywhere to live without fear of harm or discrimination. The community’s response has been swift and resolute: “We will not allow our youth to be subjected to this abuse. We will continue to fight for their safety and dignity,” Horn stated.

The movement to end conversion therapy is gaining momentum across the country, with more and more states passing laws to protect LGBTQ youth from these discredited practices. But the Missouri lawsuit serves as a stark reminder that the fight for LGBTQ rights is ongoing, and that progress must be fiercely defended.

As the case unfolds, the LGBTQ community remains united in its commitment to ensuring a future where all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity, can live their truth without fear of rejection, harm, or violence."
4/17/2025,"Transitioning teen cannot change name, Mississippi Supreme Court rules",https://apnews.com/article/gender-identity-name-change-supreme-court-mississippi-40470721a90795566e9728c71a8d89a7,Associated Press,Sophie Bates,Pro,2 or 3,"The Mississippi Supreme Court on Thursday upheld a ruling denying a transgender teen’s name-change petition.

The ruling comes nearly two years after a then 16-year-old undergoing a gender transition filed a petition to change his name to better fit his gender identity. Both of the teen’s parents consented to the name change. But Hinds County Chancery Judge Tametrice Hodges in November 2023 denied the petition, citing the teen’s lack of maturity.

The Mississippi Supreme Court voted 8-1 to uphold the ruling.

“The petitioner’s primary appellate argument is that the chancellor had no discretion to deny the name-change petition because it was uncontested and both parents agreed,” the majority opinion reads. “But Mississippi law says otherwise.” 

Presiding Justice Leslie King was the sole dissenting vote. He wrote that the record in the case is deficient, leaving it unable for the Supreme Court to decide whether the lower court was wrong to dismiss the petition. “I find that the chancery court’s order should be vacated and that the case should be remanded,” King said in his dissent.

The initial petition was filed by the teen’s mother in July 2023. She sought to change her child’s first, middle and last names. She requested to change the first name to a more masculine name, the middle name to her own middle name and the last name to the father’s last name only — the last name is currently hyphenated."
4/17/2025,"Transgender women in Britain fear ruling could place toilets, sports and hospitals off limits",https://apnews.com/article/transgender-rights-uk-supreme-court-21fcf89b655712351ba2696795d49ece,Associated Press,"Brian Melley, Jill Lawless",Pro,"3, 11","Transgender women will be excluded from women’s toilets, hospital wards and sports teams after a U.K. Supreme Court ruling, the head of the Equality and Human Rights Commission said Thursday, as trans groups digested a judgment that could have a broad and detrimental impact on daily life.

While Britain’s highest court said there was no clear winner in its ruling defining a woman for anti-discrimination purposes as someone born biologically female, noting that transgender people remain protected from discrimination, trans groups said the decision would undermine their rights.

Equality Commission Chairwoman Kishwer Falkner said the “enormously consequential” ruling brought clarity and would prompt her organization to update public codes by summer to comply.

“Single-sex services like changing rooms must be based on biological sex,” she told the BBC. “If a male person is allowed to use a women-only service or facility, it isn’t any longer single-sex, then it becomes a mixed-sex space.”


Court challenge arose from public board quota
The ruling Wednesday came in a case that had nothing to do with those spaces, but stemmed from a 2018 law passed by the Scottish Parliament that required at least 50% women on boards of Scottish public bodies. Transgender women with gender recognition certificates were to be included in meeting the quota.

But the court said that using a certificate to interpret someone’s sex would clash with definitions of man and woman and, therefore, the anti-discrimination provisions of the 2010 Equality Act could “only be interpreted as referring to biological sex.”

Out of some 66 million people in England, Scotland and Wales, about 116,000 identified as trans in the latest census count. About 8,500 gender recognition certificates have been issued.

The feminist group that brought the court case said the outcome provided common sense, protected same-sex spaces for women and brought clarity to the thorny issue. But trans groups said it had caused fear and uncertainty. Trans support services overwhelmed
Trans activist jane fae, a director of the group TransActual, said she worried the ruling would mean “total exclusion and segregation” of trans women.

“No trans women in women’s changing rooms, no trans women in women’s loos, no trans women in women’s sports,” fae said.

“The number of people I have come across on social platforms, on forums, etc., saying ‘How do I go on? I am in tears, I’m in pieces. I am shattered. I am broken,’” fae said. “That seems to be pretty much a unanimous reaction.”

Gendered Intelligence, a charity dedicated to understanding gender diversity and improving trans lives, said its support services had been overwhelmed with calls from people worried about whether they’d be able to return to their soccer team next week, receive medical care or get support for domestic violence.

“The fear and the despair is very, very real,” said spokesperson Cleo Madeleine. “And in all of this talk of whether or not people are going to be excluded, whether or not people are going to be banned, there’s been no real sense of what we’re supposed to do if we are.”

Falkner noted that there was no law requiring single-sex spaces and she encouraged trans groups to advocate for neutral spaces such as unisex toilets or changing rooms. Divisive issue in the culture wars
Gender identity has not been as divisive in the U.K. as the U.S., where it has created political firestorms in some states, but the topic factors into Britain’s own culture wars.

Newspapers have reported on a group of female nurses who sued their employer after they had to share a changing room with a male colleague who identifies as female, and about a nurse who was suspended for calling a transgender pedophile “mister.”

Chris Evans, editor of The Telegraph, a politically conservative London newspaper, said in its morning newsletter Thursday that the court had “declared that transgender women are not legally women,” and said it was looking into what the ruling means for “public bodies who have sacrificed women’s rights on the altar of inclusivity.”

British Transport Police announced it was reviewing its policies in light of the ruling and would temporarily change the way it conducts strip searches of transgender people in custody by assigning an officer of the same biological birth sex. Uncertainty over what comes next for trans people
Falkner said her group would continue to defend the rights of trans people.

“They have rights, and their rights must be respected,” she said. “It’s not a victory for an increase in unpleasant actions against trans people. We will not tolerate that.”

But Madeleine said that Falkner had provided no sense of what the future holds for vulnerable people who may find themselves shut out of sports, counseling services and health care.

“My concern is that if the equalities minister does push for transgender people to be shut out from these spaces, as they say, there’s going to be nowhere else for them to go,” Madeleine said. “The message we’re getting, frankly, from the highest equalities office in the country is that they want to get rid of us, and they don’t really care where we go.”"
4/16/2025,Trump administration sues Maine over participation of transgender athletes in girls sports,https://apnews.com/article/maine-education-department-transgender-athletes-pam-bondi-5b5c8d0022233fae5ec60efc9fa5394f,Associated Press,"Alanna Durkin Richer, Eric Tucker, Patrick Whittle",Pro,3,"Trump’s departments of Education and Health and Human Services have said Maine’s education agency is violating the federal Title IX antidiscrimination law by allowing transgender girls to participate on girls teams. The Justice Department is asking the court to order the state to direct all schools to prohibit the participation of males in athletic competition designated for females.


Maine officials have refused to agree with a settlement that would have banned transgender students from sports, arguing that the law does not prevent schools from letting transgender athletes participate. Mills said Wednesday that the lawsuit was expected and is part of a pressure campaign by Washington to force Maine to ignore its own human rights laws. “This matter has never been about school sports or the protection of women and girls, as has been claimed, it is about states rights and defending the rule of law against a federal government bent on imposing its will, instead of upholding the law,” Mills said in a statement.

Maine’s attorney general, Aaron Frey, said Wednesday he is confident Maine is acting in accordance with state and federal law.

“Our position is further bolstered by the complete lack of any legal citation supporting the Administration’s position in its own complaint,” he said in a statement. “While the President issued an executive order that reflects his own interpretation of the law, anyone with the most basic understanding of American civics understands the president does not create law nor interpret law. ”

The government’s complaint cites as examples the case of a transgender athlete who in February won first place in pole vault at a Maine indoor track and field meet and a transgender athlete who last year began competing in female cross country races in the state and placed first in a girl’s 5K run. The lawsuit reflects a stark philosophical turnabout from the position on gender identity issues taken during Democratic administrations.

Under President Joe Biden, the government tried to extend civil rights policies to protect transgender people. In 2016, the Justice Department, then led by Attorney General Loretta Lynch, sued North Carolina over a law that required transgender people to use public restrooms and showers that corresponded the gender on their birth certificate.

Trump signed an executive order in February, “Keeping Men Out of Women’s Sports,” that gave federal agencies wide latitude to ensure entities that receive federal funding abide by Title IX in alignment with his administration’s interpretation of “sex” as the gender someone was assigned at birth.

Bondi was joined at the news conference by former University of Kentucky swimmer Riley Gaines, who has emerged as a public face of the opposition to transgender athletes. Gaines tied with a transgender athlete for fifth place in a 2022 NCAA championship and has testified before lawmakers across the country on the issue. She and others frame the issue as women’s rights. During a February meeting with governors, Trump threatened to pull federal funding from Maine if the state did not comply with his executive order. Mills responded: “We’ll see you in court.”

Maine sued the administration this month after the Department of Agriculture said it was pausing some money for the state’s educational programs because of what the administration contended was Maine’s failure to comply with the Title IX law. A federal judge on Friday ordered the administration to unfreeze funds intended for a Maine child nutrition program.

Questions over the rights of transgender people have become a major political issue in the past five years.

Twenty-six states have laws or policies barring transgender girls from girls school sports. GOP-controlled states have also been banning gender-affirming health care for transgender minors and restricting bathroom use in schools and sometimes other public buildings."
4/16/2025,A look at recent global actions limiting legal recognitions for transgender people,https://apnews.com/article/transgender-rights-uk-usa-global-57d5bf507d5674f89f2848d21bfb3110,Associated Press,None listed,Pro,"3, 11","A ruling Wednesday from the top court in the United Kingdom that says the legal definition of a woman is someone born biologically female is the latest high-profile action globally involving the issue of what legal recognitions transgender people are allowed. The spectrum of protections around the world ranges widely, from none at all in a number of countries to the existence of anti-discrimination protections and legal gender identity changes in some others.

Here’s a look at actions in some countries recently:

United Kingdom
The decision from U.K. Supreme Court revolved around the U.K. Equality Act, which bars discrimination along protected categories including age, race, and sex. The court’s ruling said that for the purposes of the act, the definition of a woman is someone born biologically female, which excludes transgender people. The unanimous decision means trans women can be barred from places like women-only changing rooms and homeless shelters and kept from groups like those offer medical or counseling services only to women. But the ruling also said the decision didn’t mean transgender people were without any legal protection, because the Equality Act also recognizes gender reassignment as a protected category.

Supporters of For Women Scotland, the group that brought the suit, celebrated the decision while advocates for transgender rights called it a setback.


Hungary
Rights for transgender people were restricted as part of a wider crackdown on LGBTQ+ communities in Hungary through an amendment to its constitution passed on April 14. The measure was proposed by the ruling coalition led by populist Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, and easily sailed through Hungary’s parliament.

Under the new amendment, the nation’s constitution says there are two sexes, male and female. A government spokesman called it “a clarification that legal norms are based on biological reality.” It lays a constitutional groundwork for denying transgender people the ability to have their gender identities protected.

Critics of the amendment said it was about humiliating and excluding people, and part of the ruling party’s moves toward authoritarianism. The amendment also banned any public events from LGBTQ+ communities, which Hungary’s government has strongly campaigned against in recent years. 
United States
President Donald Trump has made a ban on transgender participation in sports a central focus of his administration. On Wednesday, he sued the state of Maine for not following an executive order he signed that banned transgender athletes from participating in girls’ and women’s sports.

In a February meeting with state governors, Trump called out Gov. Janet Mills for not complying with his order, and threatened to pull federal funding, to which Mills replied, “We’ll see you in court.”

The administration’s lawsuit calls for Maine to be ordered to tell its schools that it’s prohibited for males to participate in athletic competition designated for females.

Another of Trump’s executive orders insists on a rigid definition of the sexes, rather than gender, for federal government purposes. The orders are facing court challenges. For its part, Maine sued the administration after the Department of Agriculture said it was pausing some money for the state’s educational programs. A federal judge on Friday ordered the administration to unfreeze funds intended for a Maine child nutrition program.

It’s not just on the federal level; the question of legal protections for transgender people is a political issue in many American states as well. In twenty-six states, transgender girls from are banned from girls school sports. Other issues around the country include access to gender-related healthcare for minors and bathroom access in public spaces like schools and government buildings."
4/15/2025,"Hungary passes constitutional amendment to ban LGBTQ+ public events, seen as a major blow to rights",https://apnews.com/article/hungary-pride-ban-amendment-orban-gay-rights-lgbtq-155ec12cbbde7cc6be0f96adb323de77,Associated Press,Justin Spike,Pro,"3, 4, 11","Hungary’s parliament on Monday passed an amendment to the constitution that allows the government to ban public events by LGBTQ+ communities, a decision that legal scholars and critics call another step toward authoritarianism by the populist government.

The amendment, which required a two-thirds vote, passed along party lines with 140 votes for and 21 against. It was proposed by the ruling Fidesz-KDNP coalition led by populist Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.

Ahead of the vote — the final step for the amendment — opposition politicians and other protesters attempted to blockade the entrance to a parliament parking garage. Police physically removed demonstrators, who had used zip ties to bind themselves together.

The amendment declares that children’s rights to moral, physical and spiritual development supersede any right other than the right to life, including that to peacefully assemble. Hungary’s contentious “child protection” legislation prohibits the “depiction or promotion” of homosexuality to minors aged under 18.
The amendment codifies a law fast-tracked through parliament in March that bans public events held by LGBTQ+ communities, including the popular Pride event in Budapest that draws thousands annually. That law also allows authorities to use facial recognition tools to identify people who attend prohibited events — such as Budapest Pride — and can come with fines of up to 200,000 Hungarian forints ($546).


Dávid Bedő, a lawmaker with the opposition Momentum party who participated in the attempted blockade, said before the vote that Orbán and Fidesz for the past 15 years “have been dismantling democracy and the rule of law, and in the past two or three months, we see that this process has been sped up.”

He said as elections approach in 2026 and Orbán’s party lags in the polls behind a popular new challenger from the opposition, “they will do everything in their power to stay in power.” Opposition lawmakers used air horns to disrupt the vote, which continued after a few moments.

Hungary’s government has campaigned against LGBTQ+ communities in recent years, and argues its “child protection” policies, which forbid the availability to minors of any material that mentions homosexuality, are needed to protect children from what it calls “woke ideology” and “gender madness.”

Critics say the measures do little to protect children and are being used to distract from more serious problems facing the country and mobilize Orbán’s right-wing base ahead of elections.

“This whole endeavor which we see launched by the government, it has nothing to do with children’s rights,” said Dánel Döbrentey, a lawyer with the Hungarian Civil Liberties Union, calling it “pure propaganda.”

Constitution recognizes two sexes
The new amendment also states that the constitution recognizes two sexes, male and female, an expansion of an earlier amendment that prohibits same-sex adoption by stating that a mother is a woman and a father is a man.

The declaration provides a constitutional basis for denying the gender identities of transgender people, as well as ignoring the existence of intersex individuals who are born with sexual characteristics that do not align with binary conceptions of male and female.

In a statement on Monday, government spokesperson Zoltán Kovács wrote that the change is “not an attack on individual self-expression, but a clarification that legal norms are based on biological reality.”

Döbrentey, the lawyer, said it was “a clear message” for transgender and intersex people: “It is definitely and purely and strictly about humiliating people and excluding them, not just from the national community, but even from the community of human beings.”

The amendment is the 15th to Hungary’s constitution since Orbán’s party unilaterally authored and approved it in 2011.  Facial recognition to identify demonstrators
Ádám Remport, a lawyer with the HCLU, said that while Hungary has used facial recognition tools since 2015 to assist police in criminal investigations and finding missing persons, the recent law banning Pride allows the technology to be used in a much broader and problematic manner. That includes for monitoring and deterring political protests.

“One of the most fundamental problems is its invasiveness, just the sheer scale of the intrusion that happens when you apply mass surveillance to a crowd,” Remport said.

“More salient in this case is the effect on the freedom of assembly, specifically the chilling effect that arises when people are scared to go out and show their political or ideological beliefs for fear of being persecuted,” he added.

Suspension of citizenship
The amendment passed Monday also allows for Hungarians who hold dual citizenship in a non-European Economic Area country to have their citizenship suspended for up to 10 years if they are deemed to pose a threat to public order, public security or national security.

Hungary has taken steps in recent months to protect its national sovereignty from what it claims are foreign efforts to influence its politics or even topple Orbán’s government.

The self-described “illiberal” leader has accelerated his longstanding efforts to crack down on critics such as media outlets and groups devoted to civil rights and anti-corruption, which he says have undermined Hungary’s sovereignty by receiving financial assistance from international donors.

In a speech laden with conspiracy theories in March, Orbán compared people who work for such groups to insects, and pledged to “eliminate the entire shadow army” of foreign-funded “politicians, judges, journalists, pseudo-NGOs and political activists.”"
4/2/2025,Montana’s anti-transgender bathroom restrictions are on hold under a judge’s order,https://apnews.com/article/montana-transgender-bathroom-law-judge-order-9dea02ee6d1d2e6f0a1b01e632006747,Associated Press,None listed,Pro,12,"A judge on Wednesday temporarily blocked a Montana law that restricts transgender people’s use of bathrooms in public buildings.

The measure, which Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte signed into effect last week, threatened to deprive transgender people of their constitutional right to equal protection under the law, Montana District Court Judge Shane Vannatta ruled. The law prevents people from using restrooms in public buildings that do not align with the sex they were assigned at birth.

The five people who sued over the law were likely to prevail, Vannatta added in his ruling.

The new law “is motivated by animus and supported by no evidence that its restrictions advance its purported purpose to protect women’s safety and privacy,” Vannatta wrote.

The judge’s order will be in effect at least until an April 21 hearing on whether it should continue to be blocked while the lawsuit moves ahead. Gianforte spokesperson Kaitlin Price said the governor will defend the law “and the privacy and safety of women and girls.”

“We’re not surprised to see far-left activists run to the courts to stop this common sense law,” Price said in an emailed statement. “A man shouldn’t be in a women’s restroom, shouldn’t be in a women’s shower room and shouldn’t be housed in a women’s prison.” The American Civil Liberties Union praised the ruling.

“Today’s ruling provides enormous relief to trans Montanans across the state. The state’s relentless attacks on trans and Two Spirit people cannot withstand constitutional scrutiny by the courts,” said a statement by Alex Rate, ACLU of Montana’s legal director.


The law passed this year despite opposition from Democrats who worried it would complicate daily life for two fellow lawmakers who are transgender and nonbinary. They included Rep. Zooey Zephyr, a Missoula Democrat who in 2023 was silenced and sanctioned by her Republican colleagues for comments she made on the House floor. The law would require public buildings including the state Capitol, schools, jails, prisons, libraries and state-funded domestic violence shelters to provide separate spaces for men and women. It defines the sexes based on a person’s chromosomes and reproductive biology, despite a recent state court ruling that declared the definitions unconstitutional.

The order wasn’t unexpected, bill sponsor Republican Rep. Kerri Seekins-Crowe said in an emailed statement.

“I am thankful that there is a team of Montanans devoted to protecting women’s spaces from men who desire to invade them,” said Seekins-Crowe.

At least a dozen other states already have variations of bathroom bans on the books, many directed at schools. Even more states, including Montana, have passed laws to ban gender-affirming medical care for transgender children and keep trans girls out of girls sports.

Montana’s law allows people to sue a facility if it does not prevent people from using restrooms or changing rooms that do not align with their sex assigned at birth. They can recover nominal damages, generally $1, and the entity could be required to pay the plaintiff’s legal fees."
4/1/2025,California lawmakers reject bills to ban trans athletes’ participation in girls sports,https://apnews.com/article/california-transgender-athlete-newsom-students-ban-bc295b65ce04e5f8df7792545263f393,Associated Press,Sophie Austin,Pro,"2,3,12","California lawmakers won’t change state policies allowing transgender kids and teens to play on sports teams consistent with their gender identities amid heated nationwide debates over the participation of trans youth in athletics.

Democratic lawmakers on the state Assembly’s Committee on Arts, Entertainment, Sports and Tourism rejected two proposals by Republican lawmakers on Tuesday after hours of impassioned debate and commentary.

One bill would have required the California Interscholastic Federation, the governing body for high school sports, to adopt rules banning students whose sex was assigned male at birth from participating on a girls school sports team. The other would have reversed a 2013 law allowing students to participate in sex-segregated school programs, including on sports teams, and use bathrooms and other facilities that align with their gender identity. It would have applied to K-12 and college students.

The hearing came a day after Transgender Day of Visibility, and weeks after Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom angered his political allies when he suggested on his podcast it’s unfair for transgender athletes to participate in girls sports.

Democratic Assemblymember Chris Ward, the committee chair who leads the legislative LGBTQ+ caucus, said the bills were part of a broader attack on the rights of transgender youth. He said they could also be invasive to cisgender girls who might be asked to prove their sex.


“I don’t think anybody should be gender policing women and girls,” Ward said.

But Republican Assemblymember Bill Essayli, who authored the bill to reverse the 2013 law, said the proposal was about fairness.

“Biology matters,” he said. “Sports are one of the places where that reality is most obvious.”

Taylor Starling, a student-athlete in Riverside who says a trans runner took her spot on her high school’s varsity cross country team, said a ban would help ensure female athletes are treated fairly. “Why are girls being told that we must sit down and be quiet while boys unfairly get ahead of us in life?” she said.

But LGBTQ+ advocates and parents of transgender children urged lawmakers to support trans kids — in sports and beyond.

Cati Johnson, a parent of a transgender girl in middle school, said it was important to defend the rights and protections of trans kids, such as the ability to use a restroom that aligns with their gender identity.

“The facilities ban really sends the message that she is not welcome as her authentic self,” Johnson said of her daughter. “And that’s just not OK.”

There are more than 49,000 trans youth aged 13 to 17 in California, according to an estimate from the Williams Institute, a group at the UCLA School of Law that researches LGBTQ+ issues.

“While we know of a few high-profile stories of trans girls who play on teams, we are not seeing evidence that their participation is unfair or harmful,” said Elana Redfield, the group’s federal policy director. “Mostly, these laws appear to be motivated by anti-transgender bias.” At least 24 states have laws on the books barring transgender women and girls from participating in certain women’s or girls sports competitions. Judges have temporarily blocked bans in Arizona, Idaho and Utah. In New Hampshire and West Virginia, students who sued those states over bans were allowed to compete. At the federal level, President Donald Trump signed an executive order last month aimed at barring transgender athletes from participating in girls and women’s sports.

Some states have also imposed bans on gender-affirming care and required schools to share students’ gender identity with parents without the students’ consent.

Essayli and other proponents of the proposals referred multiple times to Newsom’s comments. The governor later told The Los Angeles Times he had deliberated on the issue for years, and he stuck by his comments.

“I know that hurt a lot of people. But respectfully, I just disagree with those on the other side of this,” he said.

Newsom has not directly called for a reversal of existing state law and won’t have to weigh in after the bills died.

Education Secretary Linda McMahon sent Newsom a letter last week, saying his remarks on his podcast caught her attention and requesting he clarify his stance.

“Take a stand on your convictions,” she wrote. “Be clear about the harms of gender confusion. Protect female spaces. Do not encourage children to seek permanent medical interventions to their sex. Inform parents.”

The U.S. Department of Education also announced an investigation last week into the state education department over a law banning school districts from requiring teachers and staff to notify parents if a student changes their gender identity at school."
3/24/2025,Trump administration cancels at least 68 grants focused on LGBTQ health questions,https://apnews.com/article/lgbtq-research-grants-terminated-trump-5b2810312de1420ca3df875314b0a1e9,Associated Press,Carla K. Johnson,Pro,"5, 7","A surge of grant cancellations hit researchers focused on the health of gay, lesbian and transgender people last week, as the Trump administration continues to target what it describes as ideologically driven science.

Last week the U.S. government terminated at least 68 grants to 46 institutions totaling nearly $40 million when awarded, according to a government website. Some of the grant money has already been spent, but at least $1.36 million in future support was yanked as a result of the cuts, a significant undercount because estimates were available for less than a third of grants.

Most were in some way related to sexual minorities, including research focused on HIV prevention. Other canceled studies centered on cancer, youth suicide and bone health.

Health and Human Services spokesman Andrew Nixon said the agency is “dedicated to restoring our agencies to their tradition of upholding gold-standard, evidence-based science.” The grants were awarded by the National Institutes of Health, an agency under HHS. One canceled project at Vanderbilt University had been following the overall health of more than 1,200 LGBTQ people age 50 and older. Most of the money has been spent from the grant funding the project, but it was up for renewal in April, said Tara McKay, who leads Vanderbilt’s LGBTQ+ Policy Lab. She said the grant won’t be renewed because of the termination, which jeopardizes any long-term results. Still, the Vanderbilt project had already generated two dozen published papers, including work used to train doctors to provide better care to LGBTQ people, increasing the likelihood of cancer screenings and other preventive care.


“That saves us a lot of money in health care and saves lives,” McKay said.

Insights from minority populations can increase knowledge that affects everyone, said Simon Rosser, who studies cancer in gay and bisexual men at the University of Minnesota. “We now no longer have anywhere studying LGBT cancer in the United States,” said Rosser, who saw his grants canceled on Friday.

“When you decide to cancel all the grants on sexual minorities, you really slow down scientific discovery, for everyone,” Rosser said. Young researchers will lose their jobs, and the field as a whole will suffer, he added.

“It’s a loss of a whole generation of science,” Rosser said.

Termination letters seen by The Associated Press gave as reasons that the research was “unscientific” or did “nothing to enhance the health of many Americans.”

That language felt personal and stinging, McKay said.

“My project’s been accused of having no benefit to the American people. And, you know, queer and trans folks are Americans also,” McKay said.

3/22/2025,Denmark advises transgender people to contact US Embassy before traveling to the United States,https://apnews.com/article/denmark-us-transgender-travel-advisory-c0b533a72f2b22b438e6a4077889fefb,Associated Press,None listed,Pro,"11,13","The Danish foreign ministry has changed its U.S. travel advisory for transgender people, following other European countries such as Germany and Finland who suggest they may face difficulties when trying to enter the United States.

The Nordic country wrote on its website that transgender people should contact the U.S. Embassy before traveling to the United States.

“When applying for an ESTA or visa to the United States, there are two gender designations to choose from: male or female,” the Danish travel advisory stated in an update Friday.

“If you have the gender designation X in your passport, or you have changed your gender, it is recommended that you contact the U.S. Embassy prior to travel for guidance on how to proceed,” the ministry advised.

While the travel advisory does not explicitly mention the new U.S. administration, it comes only weeks after President Donald Trump signed an executive order calling for the federal government to define sex as only male or female and for that to be reflected on official documents such as passports and policies such as federal prison assignments.The U.S. State Department has stopped issuing travel documents with the “X” gender marker preferred by many nonbinary people, who don’t identify as strictly male or female. The department also stopped allowing people to change the gender listed on their passport or get new ones that reflect their gender rather than their sex assigned at birth. The head of the transgender group LGBT+ Denmark, Susanne Branner, told Danish radio RadioIII her group had reached out to the country’s foreign ministry earlier in the week and asked for the update of the advisory.


She said there are a few thousand people in Denmark who have changed their legal gender and who might encounter unpleasant situations at airports when trying to enter the U.S. or could even be denied entry because their passports do not reflect the gender assigned at birth. “If you are transgender or have an X in your passport, can you risk being denied entry? We would like concrete answers to this,” Branner told RadioIII.

Other European countries have also changed their official advisories for members of the transgender community in a reflection to the situation in the U.S.

The German foreign ministry put out an advisory earlier this month, telling “travelers who have the gender entry ‘X’ or whose current gender entry differs from their gender entry at birth” to contact a U.S. diplomatic mission in Germany “before entering the country and find out the applicable entry requirements.”

Finland, too, advises prospective U.S. travelers on its foreign ministry homepage that if their “current gender as recorded in their passport differs from the gender they were assigned at birth, U.S. authorities may deny entry. It is recommended that you check with U.S. authorities in advance for entry requirements.”

3/21/2025,South Dakota governor signs anti-transgender bathroom bill,https://apnews.com/article/south-dakota-antitransgender-bathroom-bill-823b8672ec78ebaca451c97704ff1a68,Associated Press,Sarah Raza,Pro,"3, 14","A new law in South Dakota will restrict transgender people’s use of communal facilities in public schools and state-owned buildings starting July 1.

Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden signed bill HB 1259 into law on Friday, which prohibits transgender people from using changing rooms and restrooms that align with their gender identity. The bill also allows people who encounter transgender people in these facilities to seek declaratory and injunctive relief against the school or state if officials did not take reasonable steps to prevent the transgender person from using that facility.

“South Dakota is a place where common-sense values remain common,” Rhoden said in a statement, adding that the bill promotes “freedom from the ‘woke’ agenda like what has happened in too many other places.”

This is the first time South Dakota has had a state law restricting transgender people’s bathroom access, thanks to the overwhelmingly conservative state legislature this session. A bill had previously passed through both chambers of the state legislature in 2016 before it was vetoed by then Gov. Dennis Daugaard. Samantha Chapman, advocacy manager at the ACLU of South Dakota, said the organization is exploring its options against the law.

“This is a really painful law,” Chapman said. “It’s really disheartening and kind of heartbreaking, frankly, to see Rhoden take this position and sign this bill into law.”


South Dakota is at least the 13th state to adopt a law barring transgender girls and women from girls and women’s bathrooms at public schools, and in some cases other government facilities. A similar measure was sent Thursday to the governor in Tennessee; a bill is also on the governor’s desk in Montana.

Most of the bans in other states face court challenges, but those haven’t had final rulings. Courts have struck down some school district-level bathroom bans across the country. But this week, a federal appeals panel ruled 3-0 that a district judge was not wrong to allow Idaho’s ban to be enforced while the case is considered. Since he returned to office in January, President Donald Trump has signed a series of executive orders intended to curtail the rights of transgender people. President Joe Biden’s administration had sought to apply the federal barring of gender discrimination at schools to gender identity, but the courts put the brakes on that."
4/18/2025,"In landmark ruling, UK's top court says legal definition of woman refers to biological sex",https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uks-highest-court-rule-definition-woman-under-equality-laws-2025-04-15/,Reuters,"Sam Tobin, Michael Holden",Anti,"3, 11","LONDON, April 16 (Reuters) - Britain's highest court ruled on Wednesday that only biological and not trans women meet the definition of a woman under equality laws, a landmark decision greeted with concern by trans supporters but welcomed by the government as bringing clarity.
The much anticipated ruling centred on whether a trans woman with a gender recognition certificate (GRC), a formal document giving legal recognition of someone's new gender, is protected from discrimination as a woman under Britain's Equality Act. The decision confirms that single-sex services for women such as refuges, hospital wards and sports can exclude trans women, clearing up legal ambiguity. Transgender campaigners said the decision could lead to discrimination, especially over employment issues.
""The unanimous decision of this court is that the terms 'women' and 'sex' in the Equality Act 2010 refer to a biological woman and biological sex,"" Deputy President of the Supreme Court Patrick Hodge said.
""But we counsel against reading this judgment as a triumph for one or more groups in our society at the expense of another - it is not."" Transgender rights have become a highly political issue in Britain and other parts of the world. Some critics say the conservative right has weaponised identity politics to attack minority groups, while others argue that liberal support for transgender people has infringed on the rights of biological women.
In the United States, legal challenges are underway after President Donald Trumpissued executive orders that include barring transgender people from military service.
SCOTTISH GUIDANCE
Wednesday's judgment in Britain followed legal action by a campaign group, For Women Scotland (FWS), against guidance issued by the devolved Scottish government that accompanied a 2018 law designed to increase the proportion of women on public sector boards.
The guidance said a trans woman with a gender recognition certificate was legally a woman. FWS, which was backed by lesbian rights groups, lost its case in the Scottish courts, but the Supreme Court ruled in its favour.
""Single-sex spaces are protected in law and will always be protected by this government,"" a government spokesperson said.
In an example of the ruling's potential impact, a Scottish health organisation that is being sued by a nurse it suspended over her response to a trans woman using a female changing room said it had noted the judgment.
""We will now take time to carefully consider the judgment and its implications,"" a spokesperson for NHS Fife said.
Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling, who has been vocally gender critical, was among those who welcomed the decision.
""It took three extraordinary, tenacious Scottish women with an army behind them to get this case heard by the Supreme Court and, in winning, they’ve protected the rights of women and girls across the UK,"" Rowling said on X.
The Supreme Court said trans people - whether trans women or men - would not be disadvantaged by its decision as the Equality Act afforded them protection against discrimination or harassment.
Trans rights campaigners said the ruling had worrying implications.
""Today is a challenging day, and we are deeply concerned at the widespread, harmful implications of today's Supreme Court ruling,"" a consortium of LGBT+ organisations, including prominent group Stonewall, said in a statement.
""We need to take the time to digest the full implications of the ruling and to understand what this will mean on both legal and practical levels ... it is important to be reminded that the Supreme Court reaffirmed that the Equality Act protects trans people against discrimination.""
Trans woman and campaigner ‪Ellie Gomersall said it was ""another attack on the rights of trans people to live our lives in peace"".
Legal experts said the ruling showed equality legislation might need to be urgently updated to ensure trans people were protected.
Phillip Pepper, employment partner at law firm Shakespeare Martineau, said the court's decision could ""create further division and increase tensions"" in the short term.
""However, it will offer long-term clarity for businesses which have been left to interpret ambiguous, contradictory legislation on their own until this point, potentially landing in hot water as a result,"" he said."
4/16/2025,"Department of Defense sued over book removals, curriculum changes in its schools",https://thehill.com/homenews/education/5251555-department-of-defense-book-changes-removals-lawsuit/,The Hill,Lexi Lonas Cochran,Anti,4,"A group of 12 students sued the Department of Defense Education Activity (DODEA) over changes that have been made to curriculum and book removals in its schools.  

The lawsuit accuses the DODEA of eliminating curriculum that deals with subjects such as slavery, Native American history, and LGBTQ issues, taking books off shelves and canceling events the government says are promoting “gender ideology” or “divisive equity ideology.”  The changes come after President Trump signed several executive orders aimed at the military, transgender people, and diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. Military schools are under the direct control of the administration, which allows for implementation of these changes at a much quicker rate.

“Learning is a sacred and foundational right that is now being limited for students in DoDEA schools. The implementation of these [executive orders], without any due process or parental or professional input, is a violation of our children’s right to access information that prevents them from learning about their own histories, bodies, and identities,” said Natalie Tolley, a plaintiff on behalf of her three children in the department’s schools.  

“I have three daughters, and they, like all children, deserve access to books that both mirror their own life experiences and that act as windows that expose them to greater diversity. The administration has now made that verboten in DoDEA schools,” she added. The 12 students, ranging from pre-K to 11th grade, represent six families stationed in Virginia, Kentucky, Italy and Japan. 

The suit was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the ACLU of Virginia and the ACLU of Kentucky in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia."
4/15/2025,Judge rules against parents who wore wristbands to protest transgender student athlete,https://thehill.com/homenews/lgbtq/5249752-judge-parents-protest-transgender-student-athlete/,The Hill,Brooke Migdon,Pro ,12,"A federal judge ruled Monday that two fathers cannot wear pink wristbands with two X’s — the symbol for female chromosomes — drawn on them in opposition to a transgender high school athlete on one of their daughters’ rival soccer teams. 

Kyle Fellers and Anthony Foote sued administrators at Bow High School in south-central New Hampshire last year after they were banned from school property for wearing the wristbands to a match against Plymouth Regional High School, whose girls team includes a transgender player, 16-year-old Parker Tirrell. They asked a federal district court to allow them to silently wear the wristbands and display signs objecting to trans athletes in girls sports at school events. Officials temporarily barred both men from school grounds for distributing and refusing to remove the wristbands during the Sept. 17 game between Bow and Plymouth Regional. Foote also placed a poster that read “Protect Women’s Sports for Female Athletes” on his Jeep and held the sign up in the parking lot after the game ended. 

According to court documents, Fellers and Foote previously discussed with other Bow parents the possibility of more vocally protesting the match once they learned their daughters would be competing against a transgender girl. 

“The plans discussed reportedly included wearing dresses to the game, buying anti-trans gear, making signs, and generally heckling and intimidating the player,” Bow High School Athletic Director Michael Desilets wrote in a declaration to the court in October. In the days leading up to the game, Fellers, according to court documents, purchased “a large number of pink wristbands” and gave them to Foote, who used a black magic marker to adorn each one with either “XX,” the female gender symbol — a circle above a cross — or the acronym “NAD,” which Foote said meant “not a dude.” 

Marcy Kelley, superintendent of schools for SAU 67, which includes the Bow School District, testified during a hearing in November that the “XX” symbol, when used in the context of transgender athletes, “conveys a well-understood anti-trans message.” She noted that Riley Gaines, a conservative activist who campaigns against the inclusion of transgender athletes in girls and women’s sports, uses the “XX” symbol in her social media posts, clothing line and speaking engagements. According to court filings, Fellers and Foote often reference Gaines in their social media posts and on their signs and posters. 

Kelley said she and other school officials believed Fellers and Foote’s protest targeted a single player, violating the Bow High athletic handbook and a school board policy regulating public conduct on school property. Tirrell is the only transgender player on Plymouth Regional High School’s girls soccer team. 

Kelley added that she was not troubled by Fellers and Foote’s opinions on trans athletes but was concerned about protecting an individual student from being the sole subject of a protest. “This was organized and targeted,” she said. 

Fellers and Foote testified in November that they did not intend to harass or target Tirrell. Attorneys for the two men avoided describing their actions as “protest,” instead characterizing it as a “passive statement of support for women’s athletics.” But in denying their motion Monday, U.S. District Court Judge Steven McAuliffe, an appointee of former President George H.W. Bush, said the parents’ “narrow, plausibly inoffensive” intentions cannot be separated from the broader context. He added that adults attending high school events do not enjoy a First Amendment protected right to speech that demeans students. 

“The message generally ascribed to the XX symbol, in a context such as that presented here, can reasonably be understood as directly assaulting those who identify as transgender women,” McAuliffe wrote in his ruling. “Beyond ‘I oppose your participation,’ the message can reasonably be understood to include assertions that there are ‘only two genders,’ and those who identify as something other than male or female are wrong and their gender identities are false, inauthentic, nonexistent, and not entitled to respect.” 

School authorities, McAuliffe wrote, “were duty bound” to protect Tirrell and any transgender students attending the game from “the harassment, intimidation, and anxiety likely to follow” the parents’ actions. Del Kolde, an attorney for the plaintiffs at the Institute for Free Speech, said the group strongly disagrees with McAuliffe’s ruling. 

“This was adult speech in a limited public forum, which enjoys greater First Amendment protection than student speech in the classroom,” Kolde said in an email. “Bow School District officials were obviously discriminating based on viewpoint because they perceived the XX wristbands to be ‘trans-exclusionary.’ We are still evaluating our options for next steps.” 

New Hampshire in July became the first state in the Northeast to ban transgender student-athletes from participating on girls and women’s sports teams. In August, a federal judge allowed Tirrell and another student, 15-year-old Iris Turmelle, to continue playing on their respective schools’ girls teams while challenging the ban in court. The same judge, U.S. District Court Judge Landya McCafferty, appointed by former President Obama, allowed Tirrell and Turmelle to add the Trump administration to their lawsuit after President Trump signed an executive order to ban transgender athletes from girls and women’s sports nationwide."
4/11/2025,CMS tells states Medicaid funds cannot be used for gender-affirming care,https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5245488-gender-affirming-care-medicaid/,The Hill,Alejandra O'Connell-Domench,Pro ,5,"The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) is urging states to not use Medicaid funds for gender-affirming care for minors, specifically gender reassignment surgeries or hormone treatments.  

“As a doctor and now CMS Administrator, my top priority is protecting children and upholding the law,” Mehmet Oz, the recently confirmed agency head, said in a statement Friday.  “Medicaid dollars are not to be used for gender reassignment surgeries or hormone treatments in minors—procedures that can cause permanent, irreversible harm, including sterilization,” he continued. “We have a duty to ensure medical care is lawful, necessary, and truly in the best interests of patients.” 

The CMS sent a letter to state Medicaid agencies Friday notifying them of their responsibility to make sure program payments are “consistent with quality of care” and that covered services are in the best interest of the patient.  

The letter, signed by CMS Deputy Administrator and Director Drew Snyder, claims both surgery and hormone treatments lack evidence to support that they offer long-term benefits for transgender minors and that these interventions can cause “long-term and irreparable harm.” It adds that some developed countries like the United Kingdom, Sweden and Finland have issued restrictions on the use of puberty blockers and hormone treatments on children.  

However, every major medical association in the U.S. supports gender-affirming care, including gender reassignment surgery and hormone treatments, for transgender adults and minors. The American Medical Association also supports public and private health insurance coverage for the gender-affirming care to treat gender dysphoria and opposes the “denial of health insurance based on sexual orientation or gender identity.”  At least 10 states — Kentucky, Arizona, Idaho, Missouri, Florida, Nebraska, Ohio, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas — have introduced legislation to prohibit Medicaid coverage of gender-affirming care for adults and minors, according to nonprofit think tank the Movement Advancement Project."
4/11/2025,WorldPride organizers caution transgender visitors from abroad,https://thehill.com/homenews/lgbtq/5245215-worldpride-lgbtq-transgender-travel/,The Hill,Brooke Migdon,Pro ,13,"Organizers of WorldPride, a global LGBTQ Pride event series to be held this year in Washington, issued an advisory Friday for transgender people from overseas, citing recent policies put forward by the Trump administration. 

The Capital Pride Alliance, a Washington-based LGBTQ nonprofit, said in an emailed statement that international travelers to the U.S. should “understand the advisories that may be issued by their home country.” “We recommend that travelers considering entry to the United States make an informed decision based on the potential risks involved, as we, alongside advocates and partner organizations, continue to actively navigate the measures being put in place by the current federal administration,” the group said Friday, adding, “Traveling with caution and educating ourselves is regular practice for LGBTQ+ people.”

International travelers are already facing heightened difficulties entering and leaving the country, said Ashley Smith, Capitol Pride Alliance’s board president, and some transgender people from abroad are wary of visiting the U.S. with passports or other identity documents that do not match their sex at birth. 

The State Department in January suspended a policy allowing trans, nonbinary and intersex Americans to update the sex designations on their passports, causing confusion and concern about whether it is safe for them to travel overseas. The department previously allowed U.S. passport holders to self-select their sex designations, including an “unspecified” gender marker denoted by the letter X.  The new policy stems from President Trump’s Jan. 20 executive order declaring the U.S. recognizes only two sexes, male and female. 

Officials in Denmark and Finland last month advised transgender and gender-nonconforming citizens to practice caution when traveling to the U.S., and trans people across the nation — including the actress Hunter Schafer — have shared on social media stories of their passports being involuntarily updated to reflect their sex at birth, rather than their gender identity
Seven transgender and nonbinary Americans are challenging the new policy in federal court, arguing it is motivated by “impermissible animus.” Capital Pride Alliance’s travel advisory Friday said the new State Department policy “could impact some transgender and nonbinary travelers, so we encourage all visitors to consult official sources and seek legal guidance as needed.” 

Smith said WorldPride organizers are addressing visitors’ concerns as they come. 

“We’re communicating as best as possible about the different safety measures,” he said. “We’re talking consistently, and we’re having meetings nearly every single day, all day long, to go through this as well as so many other things.” Council of Governors Vice Chair Charles Allen said he attributes any decline in international travelers to the celebrations next month in Washington “completely to the change in administration.” 

Potential warnings to visitors from abroad, he said, “have nothing to do with the local communities, the state communities, the County communities, and fall squarely with the incredibly shameful tactics we’ve seen in language from the federal administration.” 

Allen added that he was “deeply disappointed” by reports that corporate sponsors had backed away from WorldPride since President Trump’s return to office in January. “It can’t be lost on us that fear is used as a weapon,” he said. WorldPride organizers have said they expect roughly 2 million people to attend the event, which will run between May 17 and June 8 in Washington."
4/10/2025,"Transgender pilot falsely linked to DC plane crash sues conservative influencer, alleging defamation",https://thehill.com/homenews/lgbtq/5243045-transgender-pilot-dc-potomac-reagan-plane-crash/,The Hill,Brooke Migdon,Pro ,3,"A transgender military helicopter pilot sued a conservative social media influencer for alleged defamation on Wednesday, two months after she was falsely blamed for a deadly midair collision over the Potomac River in Washington. 

Jo Ellis, a pilot in the Virginia National Guard, filed the defamation suit against Matt Wallace, a cryptocurrency investor and influencer on the social platform X. In January, Wallace falsely claimed on his X account, where he has 2.2 million followers, that Ellis had been operating the Black Hawk helicopter that collided with a passenger jet on Jan. 29. All 67 people aboard the two aircraft were killed in the crash, the deadliest U.S. aviation disaster in more than 20 years. 

On Jan. 30, less than 24 hours after the crash, Wallace shared a post from one of his alternative accounts that claimed the helicopter pilot was transgender. The post, which Wallace later deleted, included a photo of Ellis, according to the lawsuit. 

Wallace made two additional posts linking Ellis to the crash, according to the lawsuit, including one that referenced a Jan. 29 podcast interview where Ellis discussed President Trump’s executive order to bar transgender people from serving openly in the military. 

On Jan. 31, after learning from friends that she had been falsely connected to the crash, Ellis filmed and uploaded a “proof of life” video to her personal Facebook page. 

“I understand some people have associated me with the crash in D.C., and that is false,” Ellis said in the video. “It is insulting to the families to try to tie this to some sort of political agenda, they don’t deserve that. I don’t deserve this, and I hope that y’all know that I’m alive and well and this should be sufficient for you all to end all the rumors.” Wallace then distanced himself from the claim, according to Wednesday’s lawsuit. He said another account had started the rumor that Ellis had been involved in the crash and that the post “seemed credible” because Ellis “wrote an article calling out Trump’s trans military ban only a few days ago.” Ellis, backed by Equality Legal Action Fund, an LGBTQ legal organization, argued on Wednesday that Wallace’s claims “are outright and unequivocal falsehoods.”

Her lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado, where Wallace resides, claims he used his platform “to monetize a false narrative that [Ellis] was not only one of the Army pilots involved in the mid-air collision, but also that she engaged in ‘another trans terror attack’ and intentionally caused the mid-air collision due to her ‘depression’ and ‘Gender Dysphoria.’” 

Far-right social media personalities and conservative provocateurs in recent years have been quick to claim, often without evidence, that transgender people are to blame for devastating acts of violence, including mass shootings at a Texas elementary school, celebrity pastor Joel Osteen’s megachurch and a high school in suburban Iowa. 

In December, former Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) falsely suggested a transgender student carried out a shooting at a Wisconsin private school, and tech billionaire Elon Musk, the owner of the social platform X and a close ally of President Trump, wrote in a recent social media post, “The probability of a trans person being violent appears to be vastly higher than non-trans.” 

In the immediate aftermath of the Jan. 29 collision, Trump said diversity initiatives at the Federal Aviation Administration may be to blame."
4/1/2025,"Ohio school district reverts to birth names, catching students, parents off guard",https://thehill.com/homenews/education/5225664-ohio-school-district-columbus-trans-student-names/,The Hill,Delaney Ruth,Pro ,2,"Students at Columbus City Schools with preferred names in the district’s system have had their names reverted back to the one listed on their birth certificates, including transgender and nonbinary students, who were not notified that this was happening.

Students and teachers were caught off guard on March 19 when attendance was called and they realized preferred names were changed in the district’s system, which is called Infinite Campus. “He found out about the rescinded name change policy at school,” said a parent with a transgender son. “His fourth-period teacher advised him to go to the office because his preferred name was not listed in Infinite Campus. My son started to go to the office and in a panic ran to the bathroom to call me at work.”

Izetta Thomas, the lead organizer with the Columbus Education Justice Coalition, said she has been talking to parents and students since the day of the change.

“To have that happen on such a grand scale and to not even see it coming, I don’t think that there are any words to describe the feelings that folks had when that happened,” she said.
Thomas added, “Those names that were in the system were actually there with parent consent and permission because there was a form that parents had to fill out for that change to even be in the system at all.”

She also said she feels uncomfortable sending her son back to class. “My son has not physically been back to school since March 19,” the parent said. “For his safety, we unenrolled from his previous school. Now, his educational opportunities have been taken from him.”

Columbus Schools Superintendent Angela Chapman sent out a letter to students, parents and staff on Friday acknowledging that no warning was given. In the letter, Chapman said in part, “We did not provide prior notice this was occurring, nor did we ensure support was in place to prioritize the emotional well-being of everyone impacted.”

Chapman also apologized for how the district handled this situation.

The letter cited recent Ohio laws — including a school bathroom bill and the Parents’ Bill of Rights — as reasons for the change, but Thomas said that none of those laws require school districts to revert trans students’ names. “A lot of the information that we’ve been getting from folks at the district is that it was anticipatory,” Thomas said. “An apology is not enough. An apology is not accountability, and that’s what we’re looking for, is accountability.” The parent did say Chapman called them personally to apologize, but they said she offered little in the way of a solution.

Thomas said a number of people from the Columbus Education Justice Coalition planned to be at the next Columbus Board of Education meeting to show their support for impacted students and families."
4/1/2025,Georgia Legislature approves transgender athlete ban,https://thehill.com/homenews/lgbtq/5225743-georgia-transgender-athletes-ban/,The Hill,Brooke Migdon,Pro ,12,"Georgia lawmakers on Monday sent legislation to bar transgender student-athletes from participating in girls’ and women’s sports to Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, who is expected to sign the measure into law. 

Georgia’s Senate Bill 1 would require middle schools, high schools and colleges to restrict participation in sports and access to multioccupancy facilities like restrooms and locker rooms on the basis of students’ “reproductive biology and genetics at birth.” It employs narrow definitions of male and female that are based on an individual’s capability to produce either “human sperm” or “human ovum.”  Also known as the “Riley Gaines Act,” named after the conservative activist who regularly campaigns against the inclusion of transgender girls in sports, the bill easily cleared both chambers of the state Legislature with support from Republicans and Democrats. 

“Such a tremendous honor. There are few causes more worthy than protecting opportunities for the next generation,” Riley Gaines wrote on the social platform X after Georgia state House lawmakers passed the bill Monday. The lower chamber passed the measure in a 100-64 vote, with three Democrats voting with all Republicans to send it to Kemp’s desk. 

Another “Riley Gaines Act” applying rigid definitions of male and female in state code became law this month in West Virginia. 

In a statement on Monday, Georgia House Speaker Jon Burns (R) said the Legislature in passing the bill “sent a clear message — biological men are not welcome in girls’ sports or spaces here in Georgia.” The state’s Lt. Gov. Burt Jones (R) called the measure’s success in the general assembly “a historic step toward achieving a critical goal for this session.” 

Jones, along with Gaines, attended a signing ceremony in Washington in February for one of President Trump’s executive orders to ban transgender athletes from girls’ and women’s sports. 

Georgia’s state Legislature, which is controlled predominantly by Republicans, in 2022 adopted a similar law creating a commission with the authority to ban transgender athletes from competing on sports teams that match their gender identity. The Georgia High School Association, the state’s governing body for high school sports, passed a rule the same year mandating students’ participation in athletics will be determined by their original birth certificate. 

LGBTQ and civil rights groups have largely opposed efforts to restrict or ban transgender athletes from participating on sports teams that best align with their gender identity, alleging they discriminate against trans young people and open the door to abuse. In January, House Democrats dubbed a GOP-backed measure to ban trans athletes from girls’ and women’s athletics nationwide the “Child Predator Empowerment Act.” 

At least 25 states since 2020 have enacted laws barring transgender athletes from competing on teams that match their gender identity. Four of those laws — in Idaho, West Virginia, Utah and Arizona — are blocked by federal court orders."
3/31/2025,House Dems look to expand access to gender-affirming care amid Trump crackdown,https://thehill.com/homenews/lgbtq/5223884-democrats-gender-affirming-care-trump-crackdown-trans-day-of-visibility/,The Hill,Brooke Migdon,Pro ,"5, 10","More than two dozen House Democrats are looking to protect and expand availability to gender-affirming care for transgender youths and adults as the Trump administration takes steps to sharply curb access. 

The Transgender Health Care Access Act, introduced Monday by Rep. Becca Balint (D-Vt.), would establish grants supporting medical education programs and professional training in transition-related care and expand its access in rural communities. Balint introduced the measure on Trans Day of Visibility, recognized annually on March 31 to celebrate the lives and contributions of trans people and draw attention to disproportionate discrimination faced by the community. The bill has nearly 30 Democratic co-sponsors, several of whom, including Reps. Jerry Nadler (N.Y.) and Sara Jacobs (Calif.), are slated to speak at a transgender rights rally Monday evening in Washington. 

LGBTQ civil rights groups, including the Human Rights Campaign, the National Center for Lesbian Rights, Advocates for Trans Equality and the ACLU, are also backing the legislation, according to a news release from Balint’s office, though it stands little chance in the GOP-controlled Congress.

In a statement, Balint, one of 14 openly LGBTQ lawmakers and a member of the Congressional Equality Caucus, which has also endorsed the bill, said the measure is a response to legislation filed disproportionately by Republicans to curb access to care that major medical organizations have said is medically necessary. 

“As Republicans use their power to take away health care and continue to attack and dehumanize trans folks, I’m not standing down. That’s why I’m introducing this bill to expand access and train more providers,” she said. 

“Republicans are obsessed with attacking trans people. It’s dangerous. Over and over again they use messages designed to get Americans to fear one another and to divide us,” Balint added. “But I want queer and trans Americans to know you have fighters and allies in Congress.” President Trump and his administration have made transgender rights a key target, and half a dozen executive orders signed by the president since his return to office in January directly impact trans Americans. A sweeping order Trump signed during his first hours back in Washington proclaims the government recognizes only two sexes, male and female, and another he signed in February seeks to end federal support for transition-related care for youth. Two federal judges blocked the administration from implementing the latter order. 

Trump has also endorsed states’ efforts to heavily restrict or ban access to gender-affirming care for minors and called on Congress this month during a joint address to pass legislation outlawing such care nationwide. 

Federal legislation to ban trans health care for youth has been introduced in each of the last two Congresses. The bill’s primary sponsor, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), has not refiled the measure in the current Congress but has said she plans to do so. The 2023 Senate version of Greene’s bill, the Protect Children’s Innocence Act, was sponsored by now-Vice President Vance. 

Earlier this month, Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-Texas) reintroduced legislation to block hospitals that provide gender-affirming care to minors from being eligible to participate in the Children’s Hospital Graduate Medical Education Payment program, which funds education and training for pediatric medical residents and fellows. He filed the bill on DeTrans Awareness Day, which recognizes the experiences of individuals who once, but no longer, identified as trans and advocates against transition-related medical care, particularly for minors.

Laws passed in 27 states ban care — including puberty blockers, hormone therapy and surgery — for transgender youth. The Supreme Court will decide this summer whether such bans violate the constitution."
3/28/2025,McMahon warns schools of increased enforcement on parents’ rights,https://thehill.com/homenews/education/5220439-mcmahon-warns-schools-of-increased-enforcement-on-parents-rights/,The Hill,Lexi Lonas Cochran,Anti,"2, 15","Education Secretary Linda McMahon sent a “Dear Colleague” letter to schools Friday warning of increased enforcement of parental rights.  

The letter comes following investigations conducted by the Department of Education against California and Maine over policies the federal agency alleges keep records of students’ gender identity away from their parents, allegedly violating the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). FERPA gives parents a legal right to have access to all their children’s educational records.  

“Parents are the most natural protectors of their children. Yet many states and school districts have enacted policies that imply students need protection from their parents,” McMahon said.  

“These states and school districts have turned the concept of privacy on its head—prioritizing the privileges of government officials over the rights of parents and wellbeing of families. Going forward, the correct application of FERPA will be to empower all parents to protect their children from the radical ideologies that have taken over many schools,” she added.  The “Dear Colleague” letter from the Student Privacy Policy Office also identifies “priority concerns” for which the office is considering “proactive measures” to address.  

The concerns include schools that allegedly have policies that do not allow parents to see if the district comes up with a “gender plan” to support a transgender student and districts that are allegedly not annually notifying parents of their rights under FERPA. The letter and investigations into Maine and California over FERPA come as the Trump administration has implemented policies affecting transgender students and athletes.  The president signed an executive order barring transgender athletes from competing on the sports team they choose. Funding has also been paused to the University of Pennsylvania (Penn) and the University of Maine over alleged violations of that order. 

Both schools have said they are following NCAA rules, which were changed to bar transgender athletes after President Trump’s order.  

The investigations came after Republican backlash to Penn over a swimming controversy with a transgender student back in 2022. The University of Maine investigation began after a spat between Trump and Maine’s governor over his order."
4/11/2025,Trump administration advances effort to pull Maine’s federal K-12 funding over trans athletes,https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/11/trump-administration-advances-effort-to-pull-maines-federal-k-12-funding-over-trans-athletes-00287077,Politico,Bianca Quilantan,Anti,"12, 15","The Education Department launched the process for pulling Maine’s federal K-12 funding citing the state’s refusal to bar transgender students from girls’ sports.

The agency referred its Title IX investigation into the state’s K-12 transgender student athletics participation policy to the Justice Department, which is a key step to launching enforcement actions. The Education Department will also initiate an administrative proceeding to adjudicate the termination of Maine’s education agency’s federal K-12 funding, including formula and discretionary grants. “The Maine Department of Education will now have to defend its discriminatory practices before a Department administrative law judge and in a federal court against the Justice Department,” acting Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Craig Trainor said in a statement. “Governor Mills would have done well to adhere to the wisdom embedded in the old idiom — be careful what you wish for. Now she will see the Trump Administration in court.”


In February, the agency’s Office for Civil Rights launched a self-initiated investigation into the Maine agency for potentially violating Title IX after a public spat between President Donald Trump and Maine Gov. Janet Mills.

Trump threatened Maine’s federal funding and singled out Mills, a Democrat, and her state’s policies after she refused to say whether she would comply with his executive order barring transgender girls from girls’ sports.

Trump has since demanded a “full throated apology” from Mills and a promise to never pose a “challenge” to the federal government again.

In March, the Education Department’s probe found the Maine Department of Education’s sports participation policy violated Title IX. But the proposed agreement given to the state to sign to avoid losing its funding went beyond just addressing sports.

The requirements of the agreement would have forced the state to say the Trump administration’s interpretation of Title IX outweighs Maine’s Human Rights Act, which provides protection for transgender people.

The Education Department’s proposed resolution agreement would have also required the state agency to direct all schools to comply with Title IX and specify that the federal law requires schools to “forbid allowing males to participate in any athletic program, or access any locker room or bathroom, designated for females.” The directive must also tell schools there are only two sexes, “woman” and “man.”"
4/1/2025,"Planned Parenthood applies its abortion playbook to push for transgender rights in California
",https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/01/planned-parenthood-push-transgender-rights-california-00265387,Politico,Rachel Bluth,Pro ,5,"California reproductive health care advocates are moving to extend their playbook for abortion protections to transgender care in the wake of federal funding cuts and moves to reverse trans rights under the Trump administration.

In a state legislative package first shared with POLITICO, Planned Parenthood is backing six bills that touch on access to medication abortion, STI testing, Medi-Cal funding and privacy protections for patients and providers who work in gender-affirming care. The package comes just after the Trump administration notified Planned Parenthood clinics that it’s withholding tens of millions of dollars under the Title X family planning program and threatens further cuts to other state health resources. President Donald Trump has also taken aim at transgender care, threatening to cut off Medicaid funding to any facility that provides it, especially to minors.


Planned Parenthood now sees an opening to try to protect gender-affirming care in California, similar to how the state moved to enshrine abortion rights under the first Trump administration.

Several of the proposals build on shield laws and privacy protections the groups first pushed for to cover abortion providers and patients in the immediate aftermath of the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade in 2022.

“Plain and simple, we’re protecting our patients and providers,” Jodi Hicks, CEO of the group’s California advocacy group, told POLITICO. “We’re really looking at everything that we did, what was successful when we were protecting abortion, transferring that over to ensure our trans folks are also protected.”

The legislative package is being rolled out at a critical juncture for Planned Parenthood. The group is coming under threat at the macro level in Washington, where anti-abortion activists have spent the month lobbying Congress to defund the organization; and at the micro level in Sacramento where social conservatives have spent the past few days advocating against abortion at the March for Life and transgender rights at other bill hearings.

One proposal from state Sen. Scott Wiener, which he’s calling the Transgender State of Refuge, builds on a law he passed in 2022 that prevents law enforcement from accessing some medical records around gender-affirming care.

Wiener’s bill this year, SB 497, closes a loophole in the prior bill, now requiring a warrant for law enforcement when they want to access a prescription drug database that could be used to identify transgender men accessing testosterone. The bill also expands the state’s shield laws to prohibit health care providers from complying with subpoenas that require them to disclose medical information about gender-affirming care. It’s similar to two other measures passed in recent years, SB 345 from former state Sen. Nancy Skinner and AB 1666 from Assemblymember Rebecca Bauer-Kahan. Together, they create a thicket of legal protections for patients and providers of both abortion and gender-affirming care to keep out-of-state law enforcement out of patient records and doctors’ offices.

“There’s this commonality of the government trying to micromanage not just people’s lives, but micromanage who they are and what kind of life they’re allowed to live,” Wiener said in an interview with POLITICO.

Another bill on Planned Parenthood’s list this year is AB 82 from Assemblymember Chris Ward, which also intertwines protections for gender-affirming care with protections for abortion care.

Ward’s bill would prevent prescriptions for testosterone or mifepristone (often used in abortions) from even being entered in the prescription drug database mentioned in Wiener’s bill.

It also extends some existing protections for reproductive health and abortion providers to gender-affirming care providers as well. Today, abortion providers, patients and volunteers who fear harassment or violence have extra privacy and confidentiality protections to prevent doxxing, or sharing personal information online to harass them. Ward’s bill would extend those protections to patients and providers of gender-affirming care as well.

“It is imperative that we support the privacy and safety of patients and their families,” Ward said in a statement.

The specter of the Trump administration looms large over the entire bill package. One proposal, from Sen. Akilah Weber-Pierson — who is also a trained OB-GYN — is a direct response to the administration’s threats to cut Medicaid.

Her bill, SB 528, proposes creating “The Health Care Maintenance and Expansion Fund,” which would use state revenue or private donations to pay for services that could be cut from Medicaid. This is meant to ensure that if the Trump administration ends Medi-Cal funding that’s used for treatments and services like abortion, family planning or gender-affirming care, the state would still offer its own funding. It’s extra pertinent now, as the Trump administration just announced tens of millions of dollars in cuts to the Title X family planning program, including delays in grants to California.

Weber-Pierson said she is “deeply concerned” about the Title X grants, which are used to help low-income people get STI screenings, contraception and other reproductive health care services. Her bill wasn’t specifically written in response to the Title X cuts, but could ultimately help fill those gaps, she said.

“Whether it could help backfill some of this lost funding will ultimately depend on the budget process and how we implement it, but I am committed to fighting for the resources necessary to protect reproductive healthcare access in our state,” Weber-Pierson said in a statement to POLITICO.

Hicks said the bill could also help Planned Parenthoods around the state: as one of if not the largest providers of gender-affirming care in the state, the clinics could also lose Medicaid funding under the executive order from Trump that threatens to cut funding to anyone that provides this care.

And in order to further shore up the state’s reproductive and sexual health infrastructure, Planned Parenthood is also supporting SB 339 from state Sen. Christopher Cabaldon to increase the rates Medi-Cal pays for STI testing.

Planned Parenthood is also working on medication abortion access with two bills, AB 54 from Assemblymember Maggy Krell and AB 260 from Assembly Majority Leader Cecilia Aguiar-Curry. They both reaffirm the right to access mifepristone in the state, and Hicks said they could both change throughout the legislative process if lawmakers adjust for other potential state impacts from Washington.

Aguiar-Curry’s bill is modeled off a similar one that just became law in New York, which lets providers keep their names off abortion medication prescriptions, and adds extra privacy protections as well.

“With federal threats to reproductive rights, it’s more important than ever that we stand strong in protecting the rights of California women and their health care providers to make decisions for ourselves and our families,” Aguiar-Curry said in a statement."
4/1/2025,Trump picks lightning-rod California legislator to be US attorney in Los Angeles,https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/01/donald-trump-lightning-rod-california-legislator-us-attorney-los-angeles-00265322,Politico,Blake Jones,Anti,10,"President Donald Trump has chosen a California Republican state lawmaker who helped prosecute the 2015 San Bernardino terrorist attacks and elevated his profile antagonizing Democrats in the state Legislature to be the next U.S. attorney in Los Angeles.

Assemblymember Bill Essayli will resign from the Legislature on Tuesday night and begin the new role on Wednesday, according to two people with direct knowledge of his plans who were granted anonymity because they weren’t authorized to speak publicly on the matter. His nomination, previously unreported, demonstrates how Trump’s return to office has heightened the relevance of California Republicans who are frequently sidelined in the Democratic-supermajority state.


Essayli will oversee federal law enforcement in the Central District of California — the nation’s most populous federal court jurisdiction, which encompasses large swaths of Southern California and nearly 20 million residents. He served as an assistant U.S. attorney in the office earlier in his career.

Representatives for Essayli and the White House didn’t respond to requests for comment.

Essayli has since 2022 represented a conservative pocket of inland Southern California in the statehouse. There, he focused heavily on gender issues, traveling to local school board meetings to advocate for policies requiring school staff to alert parents if a student showed signs of being transgender. He also carried unsuccessful legislation that would have made such “parental notification” mandatory statewide.

He presented a bill Tuesday that would ban transgender athletes’ participation in girls’ and women’s sports, an issue that was given oxygen in Sacramento when Gov. Gavin Newsom broke with fellow Democrats on the issue last month.

Essayli focused his testimony on the legal side of the issue, echoing a Trump administration interpretation of Title IX which argues the civil rights law already precludes trans girls from participating on school sports teams matching their gender identity.

California’s allowance of trans sports participation is “not just bad policy, it’s also a flagrant violation of Title IX and puts California schools at risk of losing billions in federal funding,” Essayli said during a committee hearing Tuesday. “I believe California will come into compliance with Title IX, either through this legislative process or the court process.”

The son of Lebanese immigrants, Essayli became the first Muslim member of his chamber when he was elected in 2022.

He frequently angered ruling Democrats and even frustrated some moderates within his own caucus with his pugnacious approach. One especially memorable episode came on the last night of last year’s legislative session, when legislative Democrats had run out of time to hear all the bills on their docket and declined to call on him to speak as they rushed through their agenda.

“I have the Goddamn right to speak,” he yelled while banging on his desk minutes before midnight.

The Democrat overseeing the proceedings told Essayli he was out of order.

“You are a fucking liar,” Essayli yelled back twice, before walking off the Assembly floor.

Essayli found unique ways to agitate the opposing party, recently joining forces with advocates of a slavery reparations proposal that Democrats held during that same final day of the legislative session. And he developed powerful alliances, recently working with Trump’s Special Envoy Richard Grenell and Republican Assemblymember Carl DeMaio to qualify a statewide voter ID requirement for the ballot in 2026.

Trump has also nominated California attorney Harmeet Dhillon to lead his Department of Justice’s civil rights division.

Essayli will replace acting U.S. Attorney Joseph McNally, who filled the post earlier this year after Biden-appointed Martin Estrada left for private practice just before Trump’s inauguration.

The position requires Senate confirmation. Confirmation for most U.S. attorney jobs is typically routine, though California Sen. Adam Schiff has promised to hold up the confirmation of D.C.-based acting Attorney Ed Martin."
4/15/2025,Federal judge rules against parents seeking to protest transgender athletes with wristband,https://www.foxnews.com/us/federal-judge-rules-against-parents-seeking-protest-transgender-athletes-wristband,Fox,Michael Dorgan,Anti,12,"A federal judge in New Hampshire is siding with a local school district in preventing parents from wearing armbands on school property in support of biological girls-only sports.

In September, the parents wore pink-colored ""XX"" wristbands during a high school soccer game where transgender athlete Parker Tirrell, now 16, was playing on an opposing team. The wristbands referenced the sex chromosomes associated with biological females.

The protest led to Bow and Dunbarton School Districts Superintendent Marcy Kelley issuing a notice of trespass against parents Anthony and Nicole Foote, along with Kyle Fellers and Eldon Rash, according to the New Hampshire Journal. The parents then sued the school district, claiming their First Amendment rights were violated. While the no-trespass orders have since expired, they asked the judge to allow them to carry signs and wear the wristbands featuring the symbol for female chromosomes at school events while the case proceeds.

On Monday, U.S. District Court Judge Steven McAuliffe, a President George H. W. Bush appointee, ruled that the district acted reasonably in its decision to prevent parents from protesting.

McAuliffe said the parents’ ""narrow, plausibly inoffensive"" intentions were not as important as the wider context, and that adults attending a high school athletic event do not enjoy a First Amendment-protected right to convey messages that demean, harass or harm students. ""While plaintiffs may very well have never intended to communicate a demeaning or harassing message directed at Parker Tirrell or any other transgender students, the symbols and posters they displayed were fully capable of conveying such a message,"" he wrote. ""And, that broader messaging is what the school authorities reasonably understood and appropriately tried to prevent.""

""The broader and more demeaning/harassing message the School District understood plaintiffs’ ‘XX’ symbols to convey was, in context, entirely reasonable,"" wrote McAuliffe.

Fellers and Foote testified that they had not intended to harass or otherwise target a transgender player on the opposing team, but the school district said differently. The group of parents had also not protested at any previous game. In the days leading up to the game, another parent told school officials that she had overheard others talk about showing up to the game wearing dresses and heckling the transgender player.

""When we suspect there’s some sort of threat . . . we don’t wait for it to happen,"" Kelley said previously.

In February, the parents asked the court to rule that they be allowed to wear pink wristbands at the spring games to protest transgender athletes competing in girls’ sports. Their request for a preliminary injection was denied, and the court has yet to rule on the request to wear the pink wristbands at all school sporting events, per the Concord Monitor. Del Kolde, a senior attorney for the Institute for Free Speech and one of the attorneys representing the parents, said he strongly disagrees with the court’s opinion issued denying their request for a preliminary injunction.

""This was adult speech in a limited public forum, which enjoys greater First Amendment protection than student speech in the classroom,"" Kolde said in a statement to the outlet. ""Bow School District officials were obviously discriminating based on viewpoint because they perceived the XX wristbands to be ‘trans-exclusionary’."""
4/18/2025,HHS probing hospital over firing of nurse who blew whistle on minors getting gender treatments,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/hhs-probing-hospital-over-firing-nurse-who-blew-whistle-minors-getting-gender-treatments,Fox,"Rachel Wolf , Nate Foy",Anti,5,"The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is probing ""a major pediatric teaching hospital"" over the alleged firing of a nurse who sought a religious exemption to avoid administering puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones to children.

""The Department will robustly enforce federal laws protecting these courageous whistleblowers, including laws that protect healthcare professionals from being forced to violate their religious beliefs or moral convictions,"" Acting HHS OCR Director Anthony Archeval said in a statement.

While HHS has not confirmed the hospital’s identity, it is believed to be Texas Children’s Hospital (TCH) — the largest children’s hospital in the U.S. — as the investigation follows whistleblower nurse Vanessa Sivadge’s testimony on Capitol Hill. Sivadge first came forward publicly in June 2024 and was later fired in August 2024. Sivadge told lawmakers that she had witnessed ""disturbing trends and concerning practices"" relating to the treatment of children diagnosed with gender dysphoria. She also said that she ""observed the powerful and irreversible effects"" of treatments that patients were told were ""lifesaving."" 

""I witnessed firsthand how doctors emotionally blackmailed parents by telling them that if they did not affirm their child’s false identity, their child would harm themselves. In particular, I was saddened to see young girls suffering from profound mental health struggles like depression and anxiety, many of whom had also suffered sexual abuse or trauma, persuaded by doctors at Texas Children’s that a hormone would resolve their gender confusion,"" Sivadge told lawmakers.

Dr. Eithan Haim, who was accused of violating HIPAA while in surgical training at Baylor College of Medicine, which is affiliated with TCH, also blew the whistle on the hospital for ""lying about the existence of its transgender program."" The Biden DOJ brought charges against Haim for the alleged HIPAA violations, but the case was ultimately dropped under the Trump administration.

Haim claimed the hospital was engaging in fraudulent billing practices to hide the fact that it was carrying out transgender procedures on minors even though it was against Texas law. This included recording mastectomies as ""breast reduction"" surgeries and billing testosterone prescribed to a teen girl under a male diagnosis.

In her testimony, Sivadge said that federal agents came to her home when investigating the whistleblower, now known to be Haim, because of her objections to transgender medicine. She described the interaction as intimidating and said that one of the special agents ""effectively asked me to compromise my Christian beliefs and made veiled threats regarding my career and safety if I didn’t comply with their demands.""

Sivadge's attorney filed a complaint with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) on April 11, alleging that she ""observed TCH doctors, after very little deliberation or critical analysis, embarking children on dangerous and often irreversible courses of ‘gender-affirming’ treatment.""

According to the complaint, TCH ""temporarily"" paused ""gender-affirming services"" for minors after Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said in February 2022 that such treatments could constitute child abuse. The treatments were banned in the state following the passage of a bill in May 2023, which went into effect in September 2023. According to Sivadge's attorney, she asked to be transferred back to cardiology in May 2024, citing her religious beliefs. 

Sivadge publicly blew the whistle on TCH on June 18, 2024, and was asked not to report to work the next day, according to the complaint. Just days later, on June 21, she was placed on administrative leave and was officially terminated in August 2024. TCH alleged that the termination of her employment was due to improper access to medical records.

On Jan. 28, 2025, President Donald Trump signed the ""Protecting Children from Chemical and Surgical Mutilation"" order, which prevents minors from undergoing transgender treatments. In accordance with this order, HHS has issued guidelines for prospective whistleblowers.

Fox News has reached out to TCH and HHS for comment."
4/11/2025,USA Fencing responds to federal investigation over transgender competitor incident,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/usa-fencing-responds-federal-investigation-over-transgender-athlete-incident,Fox,Jackson Thompson,Anti,12,"USA Fencing has acknowledged a forthcoming federal investigation into an incident that occurred at one of its events where a women's fencer was punished for refusing to face a transgender competitor. 

The investigation, which will be carried out by the newly-formed Title IX investigations team in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Education and Department of Justice, was announced on Friday by Education Secretary Linda McMahon. 

The incident, which occurred at the Cherry Blossom Open in Maryland on March 30, saw female fencer Stephanie Turner take a knee in protest of trans competitor Redmond Sullivan. Turner was then disqualified from the event and escorted out of the venue.

USA Fencing provided a statement to Fox News Digital saying it will cooperate with the investigation. 

""USA Fencing will respond and cooperate to any inquiry as required by law,"" the statement read. The incident involving Turner quickly drew national attention after a video of her taking a knee to protest Sullivan went viral. The footage ignited widespread awareness and backlash against USA Fencing's gender eligibility policies. 

Turner told Fox News Digital that she came to the decision to take the knee the night before the event, when she checked the competition pools and saw that she would be competing against Sullivan.

""I saw that I was going to be in a pool with Redmond, and from there I said, ‘OK, let’s do it. I'm going to take the knee,'"" Turner said. ""I knew what I had to do because USA Fencing had not been listening to women's objections regarding [its gender eligibility policy]."" USA Fencing first enacted its current trans-inclusion policy in 2023. It allows transgender athletes to compete in the women's category at both the junior and senior level after completing one calendar year of testosterone suppression treatment. Proof of compliant hormone therapy must be provided prior to competition, but the organization has taken even further steps to prioritize its trans competitors. 

In November 2022, it announced a policy to give preference when selecting host cities for national tournaments to states without laws that ""harm members of LGBTQ communities"" and states that do not ""have laws undermining the reproductive health of women."" That policy went into effect in the 2023 season, the same year it changed its gender policy. It later released a list of states that it intended to ""avoid where possible"" and the states that it flat out would not allow hosting major events. This past December, a nonprofit fencing organization, the Fair Fencing Organization, penned an open letter to USA Fencing Board Members urging the re-evaluation of its stance on several issues, including transgender inclusion. Just days later, however, board members voted against several motions to approve an all-female task force to re-evaluate and revise the current transgender policy, in an 8-3 vote. 

Now, after siding against women fencers seeking protection from trans inclusion, USA Fencing faces potential federal sanctions.

This Title IX investigation will be one of the first missions for the newly formed Title IX investigations team, which was officially formed last week. The initiative was announced last Friday with the mission to ""protect female athletes, from the pernicious effects of gender ideology in school programs and activities."""
3/20/2025,Maine universities agree to keep transgender athletes out of women's sports after Trump admin pauses funding,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/maine-universities-agree-keep-trans-athletes-out-womens-sports-after-trump-admin-pauses-funding,Fox,Jackson Thompson,Anti,"12, 15","The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced Wednesday that the University of Maine System (UMS) has agreed to comply with President Donald Trump's executive order to keep transgender athletes out of women's sports. 

UMS, a network of eight public universities in Maine, claims it has been compliant with the NCAA's revised gender policy to keep trans athletes out of the women's category since the NCAA's revision was made on Feb. 6, and has always followed state and federal law. UMS was subject to a temporary pause in funding from the USDA last week during an ongoing battle between the state and the federal government over trans inclusion in women's and girls sports. The funding was reinstated just days later. 

The USDA now claims the UMS is in full compliance with Trump's executive order. ""After the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) initiated a Title IX compliance review regarding federal funding, the University of Maine System (UMaine) has clearly communicated its compliance with Title IX’s requirement to protect equal opportunities for women and girls to compete in safe and fair sports, as articulated in President Donald J. Trump’s Executive Order,"" the USDA said in its announcement. 

""Any false claim by the UMaine can, and will, result in onerous and even potentially criminal financial liability."" UMS Chancellor Dannel Malloy provided a statement to Fox News Digital, saying the system is ""relieved"" to have come to an understanding with the USDA. 

""The University of Maine System has always maintained its compliance with state and federal laws and with NCAA rules, which the U.S. Department of Agriculture also affirmed in a press release today,"" said Chancellor Malloy. 

""We are relieved to put the Department’s Title IX compliance review behind us so the land-grant University of Maine and our statewide partners can continue to leverage USDA and other essential federal funds to strengthen and grow our natural resource economy and dependent rural communities through world-class education, research and extension.""

In fiscal year 2024 alone, the USDA awarded $29.78 million in funding to UMS for research, the system said. The USDA claims it has provided over $100 million to the UMS in recent years in a letter addressed to the system. 

Trump initially vowed to cut funding to Maine specifically if it continued to allow trans athletes to compete in girls sports during a meeting of GOP governors at the White House Feb. 20.

The next day, Gov. Janet Mills' office responded with a statement threatening legal action against the Trump administration if it withheld federal funding from the state. Then Trump and Mills verbally sparred in a widely publicized argument at the White House during a bipartisan meeting of governors.

Just hours after that interaction, the U.S. Department of Education announced it would investigate the state for allowing transgender athletes to compete in girls sports and for potential Title IX violations. 

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has already determined that the state and its Department of Education violated Title IX by allowing transgender athletes to compete and warned that it will make a referral to the U.S. Department of Justice if the state does not provide a written agreement to comply with Trump's executive order.

""What HHS is asking of the Maine Department of Education, the Maine Principals’ Association (MPA) and Greely High School is simple — protect female athletes’ rights. Girls deserve girls-only sports without male competitors. And if Maine won’t come to the table to voluntarily comply with Title IX, HHS will enforce Title IX to the fullest extent permitted by the law,"" OCR acting Director Anthony Archeval said in a statement to Fox News Digital."
4/6/2025,Women's pool tournament championship features 2 transgender players after beating female competition,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/womens-pool-tournament-championship-features-two-transgender-players-after-beating-female-competition,Fox,Ryan Morik,Anti,12,"A women's pool tournament championship in the United Kingdom featured two transgender athletes who defeated their female competition.

Harriet Haynes and Lucy Smith went toe-to-toe in the Ultimate Pool Women's Pro Series Event 2 at Robin Park Leisure Centre in Wigan.

Both competitors defeated four female opponents each to get to the championship bout. Each of Haynes' matchups were rather close, but Smith dominated in the early going of the bracket. Smith defeated Jane Mitchell 7 frames to 3 in the first round and then beat Vicki Lomax, 7-1.

Haynes led the championship match, 6-3, at a point, but Smith came back to cut the deficit to one. Haynes, though, held on to the victory.

According to Ultimate Pool Group, Smith won 85 of 113 matches and 62% of 848 frames dating back to 2021 before entering the final. Haynes owned a .750 winning percentage in 241 lifetime matches and won 61% of the frames before taking on Smith.

The two players wound up facing each other in the semifinals of the U.K. Mini Series pool championships in October. Haynes won that matchup but lost the championship to a biological woman.

The rules of both the English Pool Association and World Eightball Pool Federation (WEPF) state that trans-identified athletes are allowed to compete in the sport with absolutely no restrictions, according to their website. Those bylaws for the English Pool Association have been under review since December 2023.
In August 2023, the WEPF announced it was updating its guidelines to only allow those who were ""born female"" to play the sport.

""We understand that this decision may prompt questions and discussions within our sport. We want to emphasize that our commitment to upholding the values of sportsmanship, inclusivity, and adherence to regulatory standards remains unwavering,"" the WEPF said at the time. ""Our ultimate goal is to ensure the continued growth and development of the sport we all love, while maintaining a harmonious balance between inclusivity and the integrity of competition. We recognize the importance of fostering an environment where everyone can participate and thrive, and we remain dedicated to upholding these principles to the best of our ability."" But in October that year, the WEPF reversed that protection. It allowed transgender competitors under the condition that they identified as female for a minimum of four years and submitted proof of lowered testosterone levels."
4/9/2025,Trans fencer no longer on college team amid latest controversy,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/trans-fencer-no-longer-college-team-amid-latest-controversy,Fox," Ryan Gaydos , Jackson Thompson",Anti,12,"A transgender fencer, who competed in a USA Fencing-sponsored tournament and was at the center of controversy after an opponent protested against the organization’s gender-participation policies, is no longer on the Wagner College women’s fencing team.

Wagner College confirmed to Fox News Digital that Redmond Sullivan was off the team more than a week following the controversy at the Cherry Blossom Open in Maryland. Sullivan is shown to have competed for the Wagner women’s team in the foil competition in several meets during the first half of the 2024-25 season. Sullivan participated on the men’s team during the 2023-24 season, scoresheets from meets during the season showed.

The NCAA changed its transgender-inclusion policy after President Donald Trump signed the ""No Men in Women's Sports"" executive order.

""A student-athlete assigned male at birth may not compete on a women’s team,"" the policy read.

Sullivan was at the Cherry Blossom Open and was set to face off against Stephanie Turner. ""This is a serious issue that is happening within all sports, and it needs to be addressed. There is a difference between men and women,"" Turner said. ""It is a civil rights movement for women and girls, and I prioritize the safety and rights and protection of women and girls over trans-identified males.""

Turner decided to take a knee in protest of Sullivan’s inclusion in the meet and of USA Fencing’s transgender-participation policies. Turner spoke to Fox News Digital about her decision to protest and ultimately get expelled from the event. USA Fencing has since defended its transgender participation policies.

Sullivan’s club team, Iconic Fencing Club, backed the fencer after the event with Turner.

""Red has followed every rule and guideline set forth by the FIE and USA Fencing, the statement said. ""She has every right to compete in the events that she qualifies for, and has long since met the criteria to do so.

""Fencing is rooted in a deep tradition of honor, sportsmanship, inclusion, and respect, and in a sport that prides itself on these values, the type of behavior expressed by Red’s opponent has no place. Iconic Fencing Club supports Red in her fencing journey and will continue to do so in the future."""
4/1/2025,"Gender-affirming hormone therapy is linked to lower depression in transgender adults, study shows",https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/17/health/gender-affirming-hormone-therapy-depression-wellness/index.html,CNN,Madeline Holcombe,Pro ,5,"Gender-affirming hormone therapy may help patients with their mental health as well as their physical bodies, according to a new study.

“Transgender, nonbinary, and gender diverse patients prescribed hormones had a 15% lower risk of moderate-to-severe depressive symptoms over 4 years of follow-up compared with those not prescribed hormones,” said lead study author Dr. Sari Reisner, associate professor of epidemiology at University of Michigan School of Public Health, in an email.

The study analyzed data of 3,592 patients of two federally qualified community health centers in Boston and New York City and looked at both their hormone therapy prescription and their Patient Health Questionnaire scores, which indicated their depression levels.

Those participants who received hormone therapy had significantly lower risks of moderate to severe depression symptoms in their four years of follow-ups, according to the study published Monday in the journal JAMA Network Open.

“When gender diverse patients access medically safe and effective hormone medication and care they are more likely to experience healthier mental health outcomes over time,” said Dr. Michelle Forcier, medical director for FOLX Health, a mental health and wellness telehealth platform for people in the LGBTQIA+ community, and clinician at TransHealth, a non-profit clinic in Florence, Massachusetts.

“Providing gender hormones did not just provide physical benefits to transgender and gender diverse patients, but yet again, we demonstrate that they improve their mental health outcomes as well,” added Forcier, who is also assistant dean of admissions at the Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University. She was not involved in the research.

The study comes amid President Donald Trump’s executive orders that would restrict gender-affirming medical care for transgender youth, ban trans women from competing in most women’s sports and discharge transgender military members and recruits.

Depression rates higher in transgender population
Depression rates in people who are transgender, nonbinary or gender diverse are a public health crisis and need to be addressed, Reisner said.

“Trans people experience mental health disparities with higher rates of depression and suicidality than cisgender (non-transgender) people,” he added. “Trans people are literally dying. There is an urgent need — now more than ever — to care for us, support us, and ensure we have the life-saving care that we deserve and need to thrive.”

An estimated 8.3% of US adults have experienced at least one major depressive episode, according to the National Institute of Mental Health. But a 2023 study found that about 33% of transgender people showed signs of depression. The higher rates of poorer health outcomes –– including anxiety, depression and suicidality –– in transgender people can be due to many factors, but a big contributor is the effects of bias and discrimination, Forcier said.

“Minority stress and discrimination also leads to higher risks for economic disadvantage, housing and homeless difficulties, substance use/abuse, and HIV. These cumulative disadvantages can significantly impact many aspects of physical and mental health,” she said.

Systemic problems, including stigma, attacks on civil rights and preventing access to health care exacerbates mental health challenges, added Dr. Melina Wald, a clinical psychologist at her private practice Bespoke Psychology in Connecticut and New York state, via email. Wald cofounded Columbia University Medical Center’s Gender and Sexuality Program.

Wald was not involved in the research.

Bills targeting medical care for transgender people have been on the rise, Reisner said.

In 2018, “2 bills were introduced and in 2023, there were 185 bills. Recent Executive Orders banning ‘gender ideology’ and restricting the rights of trans people have devastating mental health consequences for trans communities,” he added in an email.

Accessible to everyone
One strength of the study was the diversity in the ages, races, ethnicities and socioeconomic statuses of the population, Forcier said.

“This sample is much more reflective of the diversity of the US population than previous specialty clinic-based studies,” she said. “The US is an increasingly diverse population and medical studies that reflect this offer more valuable insights to care.”

The study also shows that effective hormone care might be feasible in more diverse community settings, Forcier said.

“That these patients benefited from care in these various primary care clinics in a diversity of communities suggests that effective gender affirmative hormone is no longer restricted to urban, academic, specialty clinics,” she added in an email.

Overall, the scientific literature shows that hormone therapy is safe and effective, Forcier said.

“We have more than 25 years of consistent, persistent, insistent evidence that gender affirmative approaches to care for transgender persons offer a variety of medical and mental health benefits. There are no studies that suggest that withholding medically indicated, safe, effective care (offers) any benefit at all,” she said. That said, care for depression in the transgender population should not end at hormone therapy, Wald said.

“While gender affirming hormone therapy is crucially important to improving mental health, the importance of access to evidence-based psychiatric interventions for treatment of depression should not be overlooked,” she said. “It is a both/and approach rather than either/or.”"
3/6/2025,Newsom says trans athletes playing in women’s sports is ‘deeply unfair’ in split with Democrats,https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/06/politics/newsom-trans-athletes-womens-sports/index.html,CNN,"Shania Shelton, David Wright",Pro ,"10, 12","Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom said transgender athletes playing in women’s sports is “an issue of fairness” in a break from most Democrats’ position on the topic.

“Well, I think it’s an issue of fairness. I completely agree with you on that. It is an issue of fairness. It’s deeply unfair,” Newsom said in a podcast episode with conservative activist Charlie Kirk.

“I revere sports, and so the issue of fairness is completely legit. And I saw that the last couple of years. Boy did I saw how [Republicans] were able to weaponize that issue at another level,” he said. Newsom addressed both sides of the issue, saying, “You know that these poor people are more likely to commit suicide, have anxiety and depression, and the way that people talk down to vulnerable communities is an issue that I have a hard time with as well. So both things I can hold in my hand.”

Newsom’s comments come after President Donald Trump signed an executive order last month banning transgender women from competing in women’s sports, delivering on a political issue central to his 2024 campaign.

Other Democrats have gotten pushback for comments similar to Newsom’s. Democratic Rep. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts has been vocal about transgender policies and told The New York Times in November that identity politics, particularly around transgender rights, hurt Democrats in the election, saying, “I have two little girls. I don’t want them getting run over on a playing field by a male or formerly male athlete. But as a Democrat, I’m supposed to be afraid to say that.”

Moulton got criticism from Democrats for his comments, and his campaign manager, Matt Chilliak, resigned in response to the remarks, according to The Boston Globe. Newsom has a long record of supporting LGBTQ rights. He ordered the city and county of San Francisco to start issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples in 2004 after being elected mayor of San Francisco.

The California governor’s comments come as he eyes a potential 2028 presidential bid, having watched Republicans wield the issue against Democrats last cycle. Transgender policies were a major factor in the advertising wars of the 2024 presidential race, as Trump and his allies leaned into sharp attacks on former Vice President Kamala Harris’ record, running waves of stark TV spots.

“Kamala’s agenda is they/them, not you,” said one ad, referring to the pronouns used by some transgender and non-binary individuals.

Newsom called the ad “devastating” to her campaign during the podcast. He went further, saying, “She didn’t even react to it, which was even more devastating.”

In total, Republican advertisers spent more than $60 million on ads that referenced transgender policies and LGBTQ rights during the 2024 presidential campaign, some of which included specific references to athletics participation, according to data from the ad tracking firm AdImpact.

The debate spilled into some key Congressional races as well, as Republican candidates echoed the messaging from pro-Trump advertisers.

An ad from Texas GOP Sen. Ted Cruz, who was challenged unsuccessfully by Democratic Rep. Colin Allred last year, featured several girls playing school sports as a large, dark shadow looms over them. A narrator says, “Colin Allred could have stopped men from competing in women’s sports, but instead he voted against our daughters. What kind of man does that?”

In response to the criticism, Allred became the first Democrat that year to take to the airwaves directly rebutting the attacks, saying in an ad of his own that “I don’t want boys playing girls sports or any of this ridiculous stuff that Ted Cruz is saying.”"
2/28/2025,Iowa becomes first US state to remove gender identity protections from its civil rights code,https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/28/us/iowa-governor-gender-identity-civil-rights-code/index.html,CNN,None listed (originally from the Associated Press),Pro ,3,"Iowa became the first US state to remove gender identity protections from its civil rights code on Friday when Gov. Kim Reynolds signed into law a bill that opponents say will expose transgender people and other Iowans to discrimination in all aspects of daily life.

The new law, which goes into effect July 1, follows several years of action from Reynolds and Iowa Republicans to restrict transgender students’ use of such spaces as bathrooms and locker rooms, and their participation on sports teams, in an effort to protect people assigned female at birth. Republicans say those policies cannot co-exist with a civil rights code that includes gender identity protections.

The law also creates explicit legal definitions of female and male based on their reproductive organs at birth, rejecting the idea that a person can transition to another gender. Reynolds proposed a similar bill last year, but it didn’t make it to a vote of the full House or Senate.

“Women and men are not identical; they possess unique biological differences. That’s not controversial, it’s common sense,” Reynolds said in a statement at the time. “It’s unfortunate that defining a woman in code has become necessary to protect spaces where women’s health, safety, and privacy are being threatened.” She added that such spaces included domestic violence shelters and rape crisis centers.

President Donald Trump signed an executive order on his first day in office to formalize a definition of the two sexes at the federal level, leading several Republican-led legislatures to push for laws defining male and female. Trump posted in support of the Iowa bill on his Truth Social platform Thursday after it got final approval from the Iowa House and Senate.

Five House Republicans joined all Democrats in the House and Senate in voting against the bill. Iowa state Rep. Aime Wichtendahl was the final Democrat to speak before the vote, wiping away tears as she offered her personal story as a transgender woman, saying: “I transitioned to save my life.” “The purpose of this bill and the purpose of every anti-trans bill is to further erase us from public life and to stigmatize our existence,” Wichtendahl said. “The sum total of every anti-trans and anti-LGBTQ bill is to make our existence illegal.”

Hundreds of LGBTQ+ advocates streamed into the Capitol rotunda on Thursday waving signs reading “Trans rights are human rights” and chanting slogans including, “No hate in our state!” There was a heavy police presence, with state troopers stationed around the rotunda. The few protesters who lingered for final passage of the bill were emotional. Not every state includes gender identity in their civil rights code, but Iowa is now the first in the U.S. to remove nondiscrimination protections based on gender identity, said Logan Casey, director of policy research at the Movement Advancement Project, an LGBTQ+ rights think tank. Sexual orientation and gender identity were not originally included in the state’s Civil Rights Act of 1965. They were added by the Democratic-controlled Legislature in 2007, also with the support of about a dozen Republicans across the two chambers.

The House Republican moving the bill Thursday, Rep. Steven Holt, said that if the Legislature can add protections, it can remove them.

As of July 1, Iowa’s civil rights law will protect against discrimination based on race, color, creed, sex, sexual orientation, religion, national origin or disability status.

Advocacy groups promise to defend transgender rights, which may lead them to court.

Keenan Crow, director of policy and advocacy for LGBTQ+ advocacy group One Iowa, said the organization is still analyzing the text of the bill and that its vagueness makes it “hard to determine where the enforcement is going to come from.”

“We will pursue any legal options available to us,” Crow said."
2/21/2025,2 more people have been charged in the killing of a transgender man in upstate New York,https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/21/us/transgender-man-murder-new-york-charges/index.html,CNN,None listed (originally from the Associated Press),Pro ,3,"Two more people have been charged with murder in the death of a transgender man who authorities say was tortured for more than a month before being killed in upstate New York.

New York State Police said they arrested Kimberly Sochia, 29, of Canandaigua, and Thomas Eaves, 21, of Geneva on Thursday and charged with them with second-degree murder.

Five people were charged with second-degree murder last week in the death of Sam Nordquist, a 24-year-old transgender man whose body was found discarded in a field this month. Authorities say Nordquist died following repeated acts of violence and torture for more than a month by multiple people.

Sochia and Eaves were remanded to county jail pending arraignment. It was not clear if they had attorneys. There was no comment from the public defender’s office.

Nordquist was originally from Minnesota and traveled to the Finger Lakes area last September. He was reported missing on Feb. 9.

Authorities said Sunday his assailants were known to each other, identified as LGBTQ+ and there was no evidence of a hate crime."
3/10/2025,"Supreme Court will take up state bans on conversion therapy for LGBTQ+ children, in a Colorado case",https://apnews.com/article/supreme-court-lgbtq-conversion-therapy-ban-2f7d1648a274dec4f99ea99c7245245f,Associated Press,Mark Sherman,Pro ,2,"The Supreme Court agreed on Monday in a case from Colorado to decide whether state and local governments can enforce laws banning conversion therapy for LGBTQ+ children.

The conservative-led court is taking up the case amid actions by President Donald Trump targeting transgender people, including a ban on military service and an end to federal funding for gender-affirming care for transgender minors.

The justices also have heard arguments in a Tennessee case over whether state bans on treating transgender minors violate the Constitution. But they have yet to issue a decision.

Colorado is among roughly half the states that prohibit the practice of trying to change a person’s sexual orientation or gender identity through counseling.

The issue is whether the law violates the speech rights of counselors. Defenders of such laws argue that they regulate the conduct of professionals who are licensed by the state. The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver upheld the state law. The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta has struck down local local bans in Florida.

In 2023, the court had turned away a similar challenge, despite a split among federal appeals courts that had weighed state bans and come to differing decisions.

At the time, three justices, Samuel Alito, Brett Kavanaugh and Clarence Thomas, said they would have taken on the issue. It takes four justices to grant review. The nine-member court does not typically reveal how justices vote at this stage of a case so it’s unclear who might have provided the fourth vote.


The case will be argued in the court’s new term, which begins in October. The appeal on behalf of Kaley Chiles, a counselor in Colorado Springs, was filed by Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative legal organization that has appeared frequently at the court in recent years in cases involving high-profile social issues.

Chiles has had to turn away clients because of the law, ADF lawyer Jim Campbell said Monday on a conference call for reporters, though he declined to say how many.

Chiles said the law, with potential fines of $5,000 and license suspension or even revocation, “interferes with my ability to serve my clients with integrity.”

One of ADF’s earlier cases was a 5-4 decision in 2018 in which the justices ruled that California could not force state-licensed anti-abortion crisis pregnancy centers to provide information about abortion.

Chiles’ lawyers leaned heavily on that decision in asking the court to take up her case. They wrote that Chiles doesn’t “seek to ‘cure’ clients of same-sex attractions or to ‘change’ clients’ sexual orientation.”

In arguing for the court to reject the appeal, lawyers for Colorado wrote that lawmakers acted to regulate professional conduct, “based on overwhelming evidence that efforts to change a child’s sexual orientation or gender identity are unsafe and ineffective.”"
3/7/2025,Lawsuit aims to strike down LGBTQ antidiscrimination protections in Pennsylvania,https://apnews.com/article/transgender-pennsylvania-discrimination-sex-lawsuit-josh-shapiro-185bb0f3cadbbb8a1eb4e5de2a8d9bb4,Associated Press,Marc Levy,Pro ,"15, 17","Two public school districts and several parents have sued Pennsylvania in a bid to undo antidiscrimination protections for gay and transgender people, saying the state’s two-year-old regulation is illegal because it goes beyond what lawmakers intended or allowed.

The lawsuit comes amid a national debate over the rights of transgender high school athletes to compete in women’s sports, and was filed in the statewide Commonwealth Court late Thursday.

If the lawsuit is successful, the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission would no longer be able to investigate complaints about discrimination involving sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression. The plaintiffs’ lawyers also say a favorable ruling in court would bar transgender student athletes from competing in women’s high school sports in Pennsylvania. The plaintiffs include two districts — South Side Area and Knoch, both in western Pennsylvania — and two Republican state lawmakers, Reps. Aaron Bernstine and Barbara Gleim, as well as three parents and seven students.

The lawsuit names Gov. Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, and the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission, which investigates complaints about discrimination because of someone’s race, sex, religion, age or disability in housing, employment and public accommodations.

Shapiro’s office said it had no immediate comment Friday, and the commission did not respond to an inquiry about the lawsuit Friday.


The lawsuit is aimed at the definition of sex discrimination, which the commission expanded by regulation to include sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression. The regulation was approved in late 2022 by a separate regulatory gatekeeper agency, and it took effect in 2023.

The plaintiffs contend that the state Supreme Court has interpreted the term “sex” as used in the Pennsylvania Constitution to mean either male or female. They also contend that the state Legislature never gave permission to the Human Relations Commission to write regulations expanding the legal definition of sex discrimination, making the regulation a violation of the Legislature’s constitutional authority over lawmaking.

The commission has justified the expanded definition by saying that state courts have held that Pennsylvania’s antidiscrimination laws are to be interpreted consistently with federal antidiscrimination law. The commission can negotiate settlements between parties or impose civil penalties, such as back pay or damages.

For years, Democratic lawmakers tried to change the law to add the terms sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression to the portfolio of complaints that the Human Relations Commission could investigate. Every time, Republican lawmakers blocked the effort.

Shapiro, in the past, has backed the Democrats’ legislation and in 2021 called GOP-backed legislation to prohibit transgender athletes from playing women’s high school and college sports “cruel.”

Most states have laws against discriminating against gay or transgender people in employment, housing and public accommodations or investigate such complaints, according to the Human Rights Campaign, which advocates for equality for LGBTQ people."
3/8/2025,Which US companies are pulling back on diversity initiatives?,https://apnews.com/article/dei-diversity-equity-inclusion-companies-lawsuits-2193ef0a864db968e6934f971f78e8f2,Associated Press,None listed,Pro ,18,"A growing number of prominent companies have scaled back or set aside the diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives that much of corporate America endorsed following the protests that accompanied the Minneapolis police killing of George Floyd, a Black man, in 2020.

The changes have come in response to a campaign by conservative activists to target workplace programs in the courts and social media, and more recently, President Donald Trump’s executive orders aimed at upending DEI policies in both the federal government and private sector.

DEI policies typically are intended to root out systemic barriers to the advancement of historically marginalized groups in certain fields or roles. Critics argue that some education, government and business programs are discriminatory because they single out participants based on factors such as race, gender and sexual orientation. They have targeted corporate sponsorships, employee-led affinity groups, programs aimed at steering contracts to minority or women-owned businesses, and goals that some companies established for increasing minority representation in leadership ranks. While hiring or promotion decisions based on race or gender is illegal under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act in most circumstances, companies say they are not doing that. Instead, they say they aspire to diversify their workforce over time through policies like widening candidate pools for job openings.

These are some of the companies that have retreated from DEI: Uber
After an conducting an internal investigation that found rampant sexual harassment issues within its corporate office under its founder and former CEO Travis Kalanick, Uber has been focused on overhauling its corporate culture since its current CEO Dara Khosrowshahi took over in 2017.

Those changes had included a ramped-up commitment to diversity and inclusion as part of a commitment that the ride-hailing service highlighted in a section of its annual report for 2023.

But Uber dropped its diversity and inclusion section from its 2024 annual report filed last month. And the word “diversity” doesn’t appear anywhere in its 135 pages.

Uber didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment Friday.

Salesforce
Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff once was on a crusade to inspire other corporate leaders to become social activists in a drive to fix a “train wreck” of inequality, but he has since toned down that message while pledging to work with President Donald Trump “to drive American success and prosperity for all.”

Although Benioff personally has remained an outspoken supporter of LGBTQ+ rights, Salesforce is no longer touting its diversity program. After carving out a section of its annual report filed last year to declare, “Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Equality is a core value at Salesforce,” the San Francisco excluded any discussion of diversity programs in its latest annual report filed March 5.

“While we don’t have representation goals, we remain committed to our value of equality,” Salesforce said in a statement.

Pepsi
PepsiCo confirmed that it’s ending some of its diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, even as rival Coca-Cola voiced support for its own inclusion efforts.

In a memo sent to employees, PepsiCo CEO Ramon Laguarta said the company will no longer set goals for minority representation in its managerial roles or supplier base. The company will also align its sponsorships to events and groups that promote business growth, he said.

Laguarta wrote that inclusion remains important to PepsiCo, whose brands include Gatorade, Lay’s potato chips, Doritos, Mountain Dew as well as Pepsi. The Purchase, New York-based company’s chief diversity officer will transition to a broader role focused on employee engagement, leadership development and ensuring an inclusive culture, he said.

Goldman Sachs
Investment firm Goldman Sachs confirmed that it was dropping a requirement that forced IPO clients to include women and members of minority groups on their board of directors.

“As a result of legal developments related to board diversity requirements, we ended our formal board diversity policy,” said a Goldman Sachs spokesman in an email to The Associated Press. “We continue to believe that successful boards benefit from diverse backgrounds and perspectives, and we will encourage them to take this approach.”

Goldman Sachs said that it will still have a placement service that connects its clients with diverse candidates to serve on their boards. 
Google
Google rescinded a goal it had set in 2020 to increase representation of underrepresented groups among the company’s leadership team by 30% within five years. In a memo to employees, the company also said it was considering other changes in response to Trump’s executive order aimed at prohibiting federal contractors from conducting DEI practices that constitute “illegal discrimination.”

Google’s parent company Alphabet also signaled things were changing in its annual 10-K report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The report dropped a boilerplate sentence it has used since 2020 declaring that the company is “committed to making diversity, equity, and inclusion part of everything we do and to growing a workforce that is representative of the users we serve.”

Target
The retailer said that changes to its “Belonging at the Bullseye” strategy would include ending a program it established to help Black employees build meaningful careers, improve the experience of Black shoppers and to promote Black-owned businesses following Floyd’s death in Minneapolis, where Target has its headquarters.

Target, which operates nearly 2,000 stores nationwide and employs more than 400,000 people, said it also would conclude the diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, goals it previously set in three-year cycles.

The goals included hiring and promoting more women and members of racial minority groups, and recruiting more diverse suppliers, including businesses owned by people of color, women, LGBTQ+ people, veterans and people with disabilities.

Target also will no longer participate in surveys designed to gauge the effectiveness of its actions, including an annual index compiled by the Human Rights Campaign, a national LGBTQ+ rights organization. Target also said it would further evaluate corporate partnerships to ensure they’re connected directly to business objectives, but declined to share details.

Meta Platforms
The parent company of Facebook and Instagram said it was getting rid of its diversity, equity and inclusion program, which featured policies for hiring, training and picking vendors.

Like other companies that announced similar changes before Meta, the social media giant said it had been reviewing the program since the Supreme Court’s July 2023 ruling upending affirmative action in higher education.

Citing an internal memo sent to employees, news website Axios reported the Menlo Park, California-based tech giant said it would no longer have a team focused on diversity and inclusion and will instead “focus on how to apply fair and consistent practices that mitigate bias for all, no matter your background.” The change means the company will also end its “diverse slate approach” to hiring, which involved considering a diverse pool of candidates for every open position.

Amazon
Amazon said it was halting some of its DEI programs, although it did not specify which ones. In a Dec. 16 memo to employees, Candi Castleberry, a senior human resources executive, said the company has been “winding down outdated programs and materials, and we’re aiming to complete that by the end of 2024.”

“We also know there will always be individuals or teams who continue to do well-intentioned things that don’t align with our company-wide approach, and we might not always see those right away. But we’ll keep at it,” she wrote.

Rather than “have individual groups build programs,” Castleberry said, Amazon is “focusing on programs with proven outcomes – and we also aim to foster a more truly inclusive culture.”

McDonald’s
McDonald’s said on Jan. 6 that it would retire specific goals for achieving diversity at senior leadership levels. It also planned to end a program that encouraged its suppliers to develop diversity training and to increase the number of minority group members represented within their own leadership ranks.

McDonald’s later said it was changing — but not eliminating — a scholarship program for Latino students after it was sued by a group that opposes affirmative action. The program will now be open to any student who can demonstrate an impact on the Latino community, the fast-food giant said. Applicants no longer need to have at least one Latino parent.

In an open letter to employees and franchisees, McDonald’s senior leadership team said it remained committed to inclusion and believes that having a diverse workforce is a competitive advantage. The company said it would continue to publicly report its demographic information and spending on diverse-owned suppliers.

Walmart
The world’s largest retailer confirmed in November that it would not be renewing a five-year commitment to a racial equity center set up in 2020 after the police killing of George Floyd, and that it would stop participating in the HRC’s Corporate Equality Index.

Walmart also said it will better monitor its third-party marketplace to make sure items sold there do not include products aimed at LGBTQ+ minors, including chest binders intended for transgender youth.

Additionally, the company will no longer consider race and gender as a litmus test to improve diversity when it offers supplier contracts and it won’t be gathering demographic data when determining financing eligibility for those grants.

Ford
CEO Jim Farley sent a memo to the automaker’s employees in August outlining changes to the company’s DEI policies, including a decision to stop taking part in HRC’s Corporate Equality Index.

Ford, he wrote, had been looking at its policies for a year. The company doesn’t use hiring quotas or tie compensation to specific diversity goals but remains committed to “fostering a safe and inclusive workplace,” Farley said.

“We will continue to put our effort and resources into taking care of our customers, our team, and our communities versus publicly commenting on the many polarizing issues of the day,” the memo said.

Lowe’s
In August, Lowe’s executive leadership said the company began “reviewing” its programs following the Supreme Court’s affirmative action ruling and decided to combine its employee resource groups into one umbrella organization. Previously, the company had “individual groups representing diverse sections of our associate population.”

The retailer also will no longer participate in the HRC index, and will stop sponsoring and participating in events, such as festivals and parades, that are outside of its business areas.

Harley-Davidson
In a post on X in August, Harley-Davidson said the company would review all sponsorships and organizations it was affiliated with, and that all would have to be centrally approved. It said the company would focus exclusively on growing the sport of motorcycling and retaining its loyal riding community, in addition to supporting first responders, active military members and veterans.

The motorcycle maker said it would no longer participate in the ranking of workplace equality compiled by the HRC, and that its trainings would be related to the needs of the business and absent of socially motivated content.

Harley-Davidson also said it does not have hiring quotas and would no longer have supplier diversity spending goals.

Brown-Forman
The parent company of Jack Daniels also pulled out from participating in the HRC’s Corporate Equality Index, among other changes. Its leaders sent an email to employees in August saying the company launched its diversity and inclusion strategy in 2019, but since then “the world has evolved, our business has changed, and the legal and external landscape has shifted dramatically.”

The company said it would remove its quantitative workforce and supplier diversity ambitions, ensure incentives and employee goals were tied to business performance, and review training programs for consistency with a revised strategy.

“Brown-Forman continues to foster an inclusive work environment where everyone is welcomed, respected, and able to bring their best self to work,” spokeswoman Elizabeth Conway said in an email.

John Deere
The farm equipment maker said in July that it would no longer sponsor “social or cultural awareness” events, and that it would audit all training materials “to ensure the absence of socially-motivated messages” in compliance with federal and local laws.

Moline, Illinois-based John Deere added “the existence of diversity quotas and pronoun identification have never been and are not company policy.” But it noted that it would still continue to “track and advance” the diversity of the company.

Tractor Supply
The retailer in June said it was ending an array of corporate diversity and climate efforts, a move that came after weeks of online conservative backlash against the rural retailer.

Tractor Supply said it would be eliminating all of its DEI roles while retiring current DEI goals. The company added that it would “stop sponsoring non-business activities” such as Pride festivals or voting campaigns — and no longer submit data for the HRC index.

The Brentwood, Tennessee-based company, which sells products ranging from farming equipment to pet supplies, also said that it would withdraw from its carbon emission goals to instead “focus on our land and water conservation efforts.”

The National Black Farmers Association called on Tractor Supply’s president and CEO to step down shortly after the company’s announcement."

The judge’s ruling came in a lawsuit filed earlier this month on behalf of families with transgender or nonbinary children who allege their health care has already been compromised by the president’s orders.

A national group for family of LGBTQ+ people and a doctors organization are also plaintiffs in the court challenge, one of more than 100 lawsuits opposing a slew of executive orders Trump has issued as he seeks to reverse the policies of former President Joe Biden.

The preliminary injunction from U.S. District Judge Brendan Hurson in Baltimore, a Biden nominee, keeps enforcement of the orders on hold while the case plays out, though the administration is expected to appeal.

Several hospitals across the country halted such care for minors in the days after Trump’s order to avoid losing federal funding.

3/3/2025,Bill to ban trans athletes from girls’ and women’s sports teams fails to advance in Senate,https://apnews.com/article/transgender-athletes-congress-dfd81b15ebc09409f1bf6c8642f130f3,Associated Press,Stephen Groves,Pro ,10,"Legislation that aimed to bar transgender women and girls nationwide from participating in school athletic competitions designated for female athletes failed to advance Monday night in a divided Senate as Democrats stood united against an issue that Republicans leveraged in last year’s elections.

A test vote on the bill failed to gain the 60 votes needed to advance in the chamber as senators stuck to party lines in a 51-45 vote tally.

The bill sought to determine Title IX protections “based solely on a person’s reproductive biology and genetics at birth.” The vote came as Republicans have homed in repeatedly on the social cause, casting it as an issue of ensuring athletic fairness for women and girls. President Donald Trump signed an executive order last month giving federal agencies wide latitude to ensure entities that receive federal funding abide by Title IX in alignment with the administration’s view, which interprets “sex” as the gender someone was assigned at birth. Still, Republicans in Congress have set their sights on enshrining that policy into law by amending the 1972 Title IX law, which protects people from discrimination based on sex in education programs or activities that receive federal financial assistance.

“Around the country we have seen men — biological men who identify as women — take up spaces and medals in athletics meant for actual women,” said Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., adding, “This is a matter of fairness and equality.” The House had already passed similar legislation with only two Democrats in support, but the setback for the bill in the Senate showed the steep climb for any legislation that targets LGBTQ people. Democrats slammed the bill as both a distraction from more pressing issues and a federal overreach into local school decisions.

“What Republicans are doing today is inventing a problem to stir up a culture war and divide people against each other,” Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, said in a floor speech. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., said, “This is a decision for sports leagues to thoughtfully craft policy that actually takes seriously what is best for all players, not blanket mandates that will undoubtedly have unintended consequences for the safety of all students.” Still, Republicans nationwide appear determined to press the issue. During his presidential campaign, Trump found that the topic resonated beyond the usual party lines. More than half the voters surveyed by AP VoteCast said support for transgender rights in government and society has gone too far.

Following Trump’s executive order, the NCAA changed its participation policy for transgender athletes to limit competition in women’s sports to athletes who were assigned female at birth.

In Minnesota Monday, the state House braced for a similar debate on a GOP-backed bill that would apply to primary and secondary schools. Ahead of the debate, several dozen supporters rallied on the steps of the state Capitol in St. Paul, framing the bill as protection for opportunities and safety for girls in sports, and ensuring that they have a level playing field.

Democrats and LGBTQ+ rights activists denounced the measure as bullying.

Following the Senate bill’s failure, Kelley Robinson, the president of Human Rights Campaign, said in a statement: “Every child should have the opportunity to experience the simple joys of being young and making memories with their friends. But bills like these send the message that transgender kids don’t deserve the same opportunities to thrive as their peers simply because of who they are.”"
2/24/2025,Pennsylvania changes policy to follow Trump order on transgender athletes in high school sports,https://apnews.com/article/transgender-athletes-trump-pennsylvania-d17b765e3d66eca489a284042315fa4f,Associated Press,None listed,Pro ,12,"Pennsylvania’s governing body for high school sports has changed its policy that allowed transgender athletes to compete in prep athletics to follow President Donald Trump’s executive order.

The board of the Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association voted last week to remove a policy that had deferred to school principals to determine an athlete’s “gender” when “questioned or uncertain,” and instead approved one that officials said was designed to comply with Trump’s order.

The new policy defers to principals to determine a student’s “sex” when “questioned or uncertain,” and adds a line that says that, in accordance with Trump’s executive order, “schools are required to consult with their school solicitors relative to compliance with the order.”

Associations in some other states, including Maine, have signaled they may defy the president’s order, while others were taking a wait-and-see approach. Trump signed the order on Feb. 5, giving the federal government wide latitude to pull federal funding from entities that “deprive women and girls of fair athletic opportunities” by allowing transgender athletes to participate. Legal challenges are expected.

In response to Trump’s order, the NCAA revised its transgender participation policy to limit women’s college sports to athletes assigned as female at birth. The National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics, a governing body for smaller schools, effectively banned transgender athletes in 2023 from women’s sports.

The number of transgender athletes competing at the high school and college level is believed to be small, but the topic became a campaign issue for Trump last year as he declared his intent to “keep men out of women’s sports.”"
3/15/2025,VA rescinds transgender veterans' health guidance as department denies policy change,https://www.npr.org/2025/03/14/nx-s1-5328733/va-transgender-veterans-memo,NPR,Huo Jingnan,Pro ,"5, 19","The Veterans Affairs Department on Friday reversed a policy that had protected gender-affirming healthcare provided to transgender veterans, causing confusion and fear in the community.

In an internal VA memo seen by NPR Friday, the VA says it's rescinding Directive 1341, which contains detailed guidance on the kinds of care transgender veterans can receive at VA facilities. The policy had also directed healthcare providers to use pronouns veterans preferred, directed facilities to allow veterans to use bathrooms and be assigned rooms in accordance with their self-identified gender.

The internal memo said that the rescission of the directive ""does not affect existing clinical guidance"" and that the VA ""affirms its commitment to provide care to all Veterans."" After this story was published, VA press secretary Peter Kasperowicz reached out to NPR and denied that there was a policy change. He did not respond to NPR's request to verify the authenticity of the internal memo that announced the policy change before or after publication of NPR's story.

By Saturday evening the memo was publicly available on the VA web site.

In a statement Saturday, Rep. Mark Takano (D-CA) says the VA is ""allowing veterans to be a pawn in the president's cruel political games.""

""VA's decision to rescind its directive on providing healthcare for transgender and intersex veterans and VA's announcement that it will be taking additional steps to undertake rulemaking to revise the care offered to transgender veterans are both shameful and cruel"" said Takano, who is the highest ranking Democrat on the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs.

Advocates had been bracing for the rescinding of the directive.

""It's disingenuous."" said Lindsay Church, executive director of advocacy group Minority Veterans of America. ""Transgender veterans now have to ask themselves: 'Is it worth it for me to get my care at VA? Am I safe to do so? What are the discriminatory factors that I will have to face in order for me to even go to the bathroom?'""

While transgender people make up a small percentage of the population, research suggests that they are more likely to serve in the military.

VA's research shows that veterans who are sexual minorities — including LGBTQIA, non-binary, intersex and other veterans — are more likely than average veterans to take their own lives; that figure is higher for transgender veterans. Veterans have a higher average suicide rate than the general population.

In the internal memo, the VA also said it will ""conduct a comprehensive review of care with respect to trans-identifying Veterans and will undergo the rulemaking process to revise the medical benefits package as deemed necessary"".

Church said advocates for these veterans are concerned the upcoming rule review could mean wholesale rollback on transgender health at the VA.

The VA currently offers gender-affirming healthcare that includes hormone treatment, prosthetic devices, as well as tools to help transgender veterans present as their gender identity.

While the VA does not offer gender-affirming surgeries, the rescinded directive also stipulated that veterans could receive surgeries for other medical conditions that also happen to be gender-affirming, such as procedures mitigating cancer risks.

Even before the VA rescinded Directive 1341 on Friday, VA staff members told NPR that they have been receiving more calls from trans veterans worried about trusting their healthcare providers.

In the wake of the White House executive order that says it's now U.S. policy to ""recognize two sexes, male and female,"" the VA has removed references to the group on some of its websites as well as in internal documents in its healthcare system.

3/5/2025,"NPS takes down web pages dedicated to transgender activists and LGBTQ history
",https://www.npr.org/2025/03/05/nx-s1-5318767/nps-lgbtq-transgender-history,NPR,Neda Ulaby,Pro ,4,"Just weeks after references to transgender people vanished from the website for the Stonewall National Monument, National Park Service web pages once dedicated to figures such as Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera have now disappeared. Both were transgender activists and key figures in the Stonewall Uprising in 1969. That protest against police during a raid on a Greenwich Village gay bar became a flashpoint in the struggle for LGBTQ civil rights (A photograph of Johnson remains on the NPS site, but with no mention of her role.)

This is part of an ongoing move by the federal government to remove and alter National Park Service webpages related to LGBTQ history. Much of the censorship appears to be slipshod. Some links to a ""theme study,"" containing dozens of pages of research about LGBTQ U.S. history, are now dead; others work fine. The letters ""T"" and ""Q,"" standing for ""transgender"" and ""queer,"" have been excised from the LGBTQ acronym on some NPS webpages but remain on others. And an NPS page dedicated to the achievements of Pauli Murray, a civil rights activist and an Episcopal priest, and that discusses her gender identity, no longer works, but a link that shows her family home remains active.

The NPS has completely shut down several sites including one about Philadelphia gay history, one that commemorated a now-closed Black LGBTQ bar in Washington D.C. and a page about an eighteenth century American preacher who appears to have been gender nonconforming.

""These efforts to tamper with our history set an unacceptable precedent,"" said Alan Spears, a senior director at the National Parks Conservation Association, in a statement. ""LGBTQ+ history is history, period. It should remain represented at national parks and on the National Park Service website, so that people all over the world can learn about it from the best of the best in the history preservation business.""

""As mandated by law, dedicated National Park Service staff have poured more than one hundred years of work into preserving, protecting, and interpreting the stories that built our nation,"" the statement continued. ""By removing these educational and historical materials from public access, the administration is making it harder for National Park Service staff to fulfill their obligation to tell the stories of all Americans and maintain an accurate account of history."" The National Parks Conservation Association is a nonpartisan group established in 1919 to help protect the national parks. It called on the federal government to immediately restore the deleted material. In response to NPR's request for comment, an NPS spokesperson emailed, ""The National Park Service is implementing Executive Order 14168 and Secretary's Order 2416:  Federal Register: Defending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government [and] SO 3416 - Ending DEI Programs and Gender Ideology Extremism.""

Michael Bronski, a Harvard University history professor, noted that a disproportionate number of the erasures affected webpages about Black activists and spaces. And he ruefully pointed out that one of the NPS sites that deleted references to queer and transgender Americans was about Cold War attempts to purge LGBTQ people from the government.

""I really see this as a symbolic attack,"" said Bronski, who authored the 2011 book A Queer History of the United States. ""The impulse behind it is to symbolically eradicate all of this progress: all of the government recognitions, gay rights, the presence of gay pride, flags on government buildings.""

""Since you can't get rid of transpeople or gay people, or bisexual people, or queer people, you can try to get rid of documentation about us,"" he added. ""That means you're trying to rewrite history."""
4/7/2025,NCAA bars transgender athletes from women's sports after Trump order,https://www.npr.org/2025/02/07/g-s1-46938/ncaa-transgender-athletes-ban-trump,NPR,None listed (originally from the Associated Press),Anti,12,"The NCAA changed its participation policy for transgender athletes on Thursday, limiting competition in women's sports to athletes who were assigned female at birth.

The move came one day after President Donald Trump signed an executive order intended to ban transgender athletes from girls' and women's sports. The order gives federal agencies latitude to withhold federal funding from entities that do not abide by Title IX in alignment with the Trump administration's view, which interprets ""sex"" as the gender someone was assigned at birth.

The NCAA policy change is effective immediately and applies to all athletes regardless of previous eligibility reviews. The NCAA has some 1,100 member schools with more than 500,000 athletes, easily the largest governing body for college athletics in the U.S.

""We strongly believe that clear, consistent, and uniform eligibility standards would best serve today's student-athletes instead of a patchwork of conflicting state laws and court decisions,"" NCAA President Charlie Baker said. ""To that end, President Trump's order provides a clear, national standard.""

The NCAA's decision was hailed by former Kentucky swimmer Riley Gaines, a vocal advocate of banning transgender athletes from women's sports. Gaines, who was at the White House signing ceremony with Trump, was among more than a dozen college athletes who filed a lawsuit against the NCAA last year, accusing it of violating their Title IX rights by allowing transgender woman Lia Thomas to compete at the national championships in 2022. ""I can't even begin to tell you how vindicating it feels knowing no girl will ever have to experience what my teammates and I did,"" Gaines posted on X shortly after the NCAA announced the policy change.

The previous NCAA policy went into effect in 2022 and adopted a sport-by-sport approach, where transgender participation was determined by the policy of the sport's national governing body. In sports with no national governing body, that sport's international federation policy would be in place. If there is no international federation policy, previously established IOC policy criteria would take over. Over the past year, however, transgender athletes have been targeted by critics who say their participation in women's sports is unfair and a potential safety risk. It became a major talking point in Trump's re-election campaign even though there is believed to be a very small number of transgender athletes; Baker last year said he knew of only 10 transgender athletes in the NCAA.

The NCAA's revised policy permits athletes assigned male at birth to practice with women's teams and receive benefits such as medical care. It it not uncommon, for example, for women's basketball teams to practice against fellow students who are male.

Regardless of sex assigned at birth or gender identity, an athlete can practice and compete with a men's team assuming they meet all other NCAA eligibility requirements.

However, the NCAA said an athlete assigned female at birth who has begun hormone therapy (testosterone, for example) can practice with a women's team but cannot compete on a women's team without risking the team's eligibility for championships. Member schools remain responsible for certifying athlete eligibility for practice and competition. The NCAA also said schools are subject to local, state and federal legislation and such legislation supersedes NCAA rules.

The NCAA policy change was announced hours after the Trump administration said it was investigating potential civil rights violations at two universities and a high school sports league that allowed transgender athletes to compete on women's teams. The Education Department said it had opened reviews of San Jose State University, the University of Pennsylvania and the Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Association.

San Jose State's women's volleyball team drew headlines last season over unconfirmed allegations that the roster included a transgender player. As for Penn, three former teammates of Thomas, the transgender swimmer, this week sued the NCAA, Ivy League, Harvard and the school over Thomas's participation at conference and national championships, saying it violated Title IX provisions."
11/20/2024,House Republican Rep. Nancy Mace introduces transgender bathroom bill,https://www.npr.org/2024/11/20/nx-s1-5196449/house-republican-rep-nancy-mace-introduces-transgender-bathroom-bill,NPR,Elena Moore,Pro ,14,"Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., introduced a bill to ban transgender women from using facilities on federal property — like bathrooms and locker rooms — that don't correspond with the sex assigned at birth.

JUANA SUMMERS, HOST:

South Carolina Congresswoman Nancy Mace, a Republican, is leading an effort in Congress to ban transgender women from using facilities like bathrooms and locker rooms that do not correspond with the sex they were assigned at birth. This push comes after the election of Democrat Sarah McBride of Delaware. She will be the first openly transgender woman to serve in the House. NPR's Elena Moore is here to talk about how this is all unfolding. Hi there.

ELENA MOORE, BYLINE: Hey there.

SUMMERS: So Elena, can you just start by telling us what exactly Congresswoman Mace is proposing?

MOORE: Yeah. She has two different proposals right now. The first is a measure to bar transgender women from entering women's bathrooms in the Capitol. And then today she followed up with legislation that would expand those limitations to all federal property across the country. And Mace is being direct about why she's doing this. I was in a group of reporters yesterday that asked if this effort is in response to McBride coming to Congress.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

NANCY MACE: Yes, and absolutely, and then some. I'm absolutely, 100%, going to stand in the way of any man who wants to be in a women's restroom, in our locker rooms, in our changing rooms. I will be there, fighting you every step of the way.

MOORE: And there, Juana, she is referring to McBride as a man. Mace says the effort is about protecting women's rights. She's been public about being a survivor of sexual abuse and says that her experience is part of the reason she's working on this.

SUMMERS: OK. We know that Republicans control the House. They hold a narrow majority. How likely is it, though, that either of the things that Mace is proposing will actually pass?

MOORE: House Speaker Mike Johnson, who is a staunch conservative, tried to toe the line on this a bit yesterday, calling for everyone to be treated with respect. Today, he made a stronger statement, saying that facilities in the Capitol and House office buildings are, quote, ""reserved for individuals of that biological sex."" So I asked Mace about that move today, and here's what she said.

MACE: I fully support his statement. I fully support his policy. Does that stand the test of time? I want to make sure that it does.

MOORE: You know, and she said she's still lobbying for the change in rules for the Capitol to be made official.

SUMMERS: And what about Sarah McBride, the Delaware representative-elect? How has she responded to all of this?

MOORE: Yeah. I mean, in general, McBride hasn't engaged a whole lot. She put out a statement on X a few days ago saying she sees this as a distraction by Republicans, and she's focused on policy instead of, quote, ""manufacturing culture wars."" But today, after Johnson's move to informally, you know, bar her from using those facilities at her soon-to-be workplace, McBride put out another statement saying she plans to follow Johnson's rules, even though she disagrees with them. And, you know, she kind of extended an olive branch to her future colleagues, saying, quote, ""each of us were sent here because voters saw something in us that they value."" And she went on to say she looks forward to seeing those qualities in every member come January.

SUMMERS: Transgender issues have come up quite a bit in Republican politics recently. Help us understand - how does Mace's effort fit into that larger conversation?

MOORE: Well, President-elect Donald Trump has spent millions of dollars on campaign ads saying Vice President Kamala Harris is, quote, ""for they/them"" - you know? - and it was about her position on gender-affirming health care. But anti-trans messaging has become part of a broader Republican political strategy. Now it's also playing out within the halls of Congress.

SUMMERS: That's NPR's Elena Moore. Thank you.

MOORE: Thank you, Juana."
3/8/2025,Arts groups sue NEA for new 'gender ideology'-related grant restrictions,https://www.npr.org/2025/03/06/nx-s1-5320245/lawsuit-nea-gender-ideology-restrictions-trump-executive-order,NPR,Chloe Veltman,Pro ,8,"Arts groups who make or support work focused on LGBTQ+ people and issues have sued the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) in response to new rules imposed by the Trump Administration requiring that grant applicants agree not to promote ""gender ideology"" in their work.

The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) filed the suit on Thursday on behalf of Rhode Island Latino Arts, National Queer Theater, The Theater Offensive, and the Theatre Communications Group in U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island.

A day later, in response to the legal challenge, the NEA agreed to remove their requirement forcing artists to certify they will not ""promote gender ideology"" in their applications to secure federal funding — at least until the resolution of a legal challenge — but has not yet signaled it would remove its applicant eligibility requirement to comply with the Trump order. The ACLU suit seeks to stop the federal agency that provides grants to arts organizations nationwide from implementing Executive Order 14168, which President Donald Trump signed on Jan. 20. As a result of the order, titled ""Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government,"" the NEA has asked grant applicants to certify that they will not use federal funds to ""promote gender ideology.""

The White House has said ""gender ideology includes the idea that there is a vast spectrum of genders that are disconnected from one's sex.""

About 1.3 million adults in the U.S. identify as transgender or gender nonconforming, and as many as 5 million Americans may be intersex, according to a brief published in January by the Williams Institute, a think tank at UCLA Law School.

The NEA agreed on Friday to remove the requirement forcing artists to certify they will not ""promote gender ideology"" in their funding applications while the outcome of the case is pending.

""No later than March 11, 2025, senior leadership at the NEA will approve the removal of the new language requiring compliance with E.O. 14168 in its Assurance of Compliance until the conclusion of this litigation,"" wrote NEA deputy chair for management and budget Ann Eilers in a declaration shared by the ACLU with NPR. ""The NEA intends to no longer require applicants to certify their compliance with E.O. 14168 while the outcome of this litigation is pending.""

It's a race against the clock: The lawsuit comes just three weeks ahead of the NEA's present funding cycle deadline on Mar. 24, leaving arts groups wondering if their applications will succeed — or whether they can apply for funding at all.

""This is an important development because our understanding is that many artists and arts organizations had decided not to apply this round at all because they objected to and/or feared having to make the certification,"" said ACLU lead counsel Vera Eidelman in an email to NPR.

In an interview with NPR, Eidelman said the NEA's ""gender ideology"" prohibition is unconstitutional under the First and Fifth Amendments. She said it also violates the NEA's governing statute.

"" This new prohibition runs directly counter to the point of the NEA, and to the point of art in general, which is to explore ideas, explore the diversity of human experience,"" Eidelman said. ""Forcing artists to be a mouthpiece for government views really runs counter to that.""

""It is a cruel irony that we may now be ineligible for funding because our so-called 'gender ideology' is being targeted by the U.S. government,"" said Adam Odsess-Rubin, founding artistic director of the National Queer Theater, in an online statement. The New York-based company is seeking funding for its upcoming annual Criminal Queerness festival focusing on plays by dramatists who hail from countries with strong anti-LGBTQ+ laws. ""These new requirements threaten the expression of not just our organization, but artists around the world whose identities have been criminalized."" The National Queer Theater was offered a grant for 2025 but the award is ""pending processing.""

The NEA did not respond to a request for comment.

The agency has been the target of protests for imposing this and other restrictions falling under Trump's executive orders.

It recently had to dial back a different executive order-related rule asking grant applicants to certify that they, ""will not operate any programs promoting 'diversity, equity, and inclusion' (DEI) that violate any applicable Federal anti-discrimination laws, in accordance with Executive Order No. 14173"" after The National Association of Diversity Officers in Higher Education and other groups sued the Trump Administration last month and won.

The NEA was not involved in that lawsuit. But like many other federal agencies, it subsequently had to update its Assurance of Compliance. The arts agency now states that it ""is not currently requiring any grantee or contractor to make any 'certification' or other representation pursuant to Executive Order No. 14173.""

Eidelman said her team has asked the court for an expedited hearing and to issue a preliminary injunction or a temporary restraining order. A hearing date is scheduled for March 18.

However, the NEA has not yet agreed to remove its eligibility criteria.

""Even though the NEA has agreed that no one has to certify they won't use funds in this way, applicants still won't get an NEA award if the government thinks their project will promote ""gender ideology,'"" Eidelman said. ""That's the part we're still asking the court to block before March 24, when people must submit the specifics of their projects.""

""We are thrilled with yesterday's victory,"" said Giselle Byrd, executive director of The Theater Offensive. ""With this accomplishment, we must remember: The battle is not won."""
3/1/2025,Pentagon plans to begin removing trans service members from the military next month,https://www.npr.org/2025/02/27/g-s1-51057/transgender-soldiers-military-ban-trump,NPR,Scott Neuman,Pro ,16,"The Pentagon has directed that service members and recruits with gender dysphoria be separated from the U.S. military in accordance with an executive order issued a month ago by President Trump. A memo made public on Wednesday from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's office said service members or applicants for military service who have ""a current diagnosis or history of, or exhibit symptoms consistent with, gender dysphoria"" are ""incompatible"" with U.S. military service.

The move comes after the president issued an executive order on Jan. 27 ordering the policy change and identifying gender dysphoria as incompatible with the government's ""high standards for troop readiness, lethality, cohesion, honesty, humility, uniformity, and integrity.""

The Pentagon's policy directive calls for establishing procedures within 30 days to identify service members with gender dysphoria or a history of it to ""begin separation actions."" It said that exceptions could be made on a case-by-case basis if the government deems an ""interest in accessing the applicant that directly supports warfighting capabilities"" or if a service member demonstrates 36 consecutive months of ""stability"" in their sex ""without clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.""

In a statement sent to NPR, SPARTA, an advocacy group for transgender service members and veterans, said that trans soldiers have served ""openly and honorably"" in the U.S. armed forces for nearly a decade.

""Thousands of transgender troops are currently serving, and are fully qualified for the positions in which they serve,"" the statement said. ""No policy will ever erase transgender Americans' contribution to history, warfighting, or military excellence.""

The Pentagon memo further states that ""The Department only recognizes two sexes: male and female. An individual's sex is immutable, unchanging during a person's life."" It also says: ""Pronoun usage when referring to Service members must reflect a Service member's sex. In keeping with good order and discipline, salutations (e.g., addressing a senior officer as ""Sir"" or ""Ma'am"") must also reflect an individual's sex."" Last month's executive order from the White House came as no surprise given that Trump issued a series of tweets in 2017, during his first term, effectively banning transgender people from serving in the military. That policy was subsequently reversed by the Biden administration. Trump had also repeatedly spoken of his plans to restore the ban on trans service members on the campaign trail ahead of the 2024 election.

There are about 1.3 million military service personnel. Palm Center, a research institute that focused on studying and advocating for LGBTQ+ inclusion within the U.S. military, estimated in 2018 that the number of transgender troops was about 14,700. In an email to NPR, the Department of Defense said currently 4,240 active-duty service members, Guard and Reserve had been diagnosed with gender dysphoria. In response to the Pentagon's plan, a coalition of 21 attorneys general from across the country filed a friend-of-the-court brief on Wednesday to block implementation of the ban, which New York Attorney General Letitia James, in a statement, said ""cruelly targets the transgender Americans who have dedicated their lives to protecting our freedoms.""

""I want all transgender service members and veterans to know that we see you, we respect you, and we will always fight for you. Your service is invaluable, and we will not allow this bigoted attack to diminish your service to our country,"" James said. In addition to New York, attorneys general from Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin signed on to the brief."
2/21/2025,"Trump's passport policy leaves trans, intersex Americans in the lurch",https://www.npr.org/2025/02/21/nx-s1-5300880/trump-passport-policy-trans-gender-intersex-nonbinary,NPR,Jaclyn Diaz,Pro ,6,"Louie figured he was taking a gamble when he submitted his passport application after President Trump's inauguration.

He had a passport, which was valid for another two years. But at the end of December, a New York state court approved Louie's request to change his name and gender marker. As a result, he needed a new passport — regardless of who was in office. Louie asked NPR to identify him by his first name because he fears harassment and retaliation at work.

Louie, 24, identifies as transmasculine. At the end of 2024 and early January, he changed his driver's license and Social Security card to reflect the female-to-male gender marker update. It went smoothly, he told NPR.

The trouble started in January, when he submitted his application for a new passport — just hours after Trump took office on Jan. 20.

The same day, Trump issued an executive order stating that the federal government recognizes only two sexes, male and female. That led the State Department to eliminate the X gender as an option and to suspend its policy allowing transgender, intersex and nonbinary people to update the sex field of their passports.

This executive order has upended the lives of individuals in prisons, at schools, seeking health care and in sports. It's now disrupting the lives of some trans, nonbinary and intersex people when they travel.

An estimated 1.3 million adults in the U.S. identify as transgender or gender nonconforming, and as many as 5 million Americans may be intersex, according to a brief published last month from the Williams Institute, a think tank at UCLA Law School that researches sexual orientation and gender identity. Those who spoke to NPR for this story say the policy change is yet another example of the Trump administration's persecution of the LGBTQ+ community by creating new barriers in their daily lives.

The changes resulting from the executive order also mean that the gender identity of trans, nonbinary and intersex people won't be reflected in official documents, they say, forcing them to ""out"" themselves every time they present their passports — heightening their distress and fear and adding unpredictable logistical and safety challenges for travel and even everyday life.

""As a transgender person in this country … this fight for our freedom, our recognition, our ability to just live our lives, this isn't new,"" says Westley Ebling, who identifies as a transmasculine nonbinary person who faced issues getting a new passport recently. ""But this scale of attacks is just horrid. It has been a really hard time, to just feel that a country is so against you just for trying to live."" Passport applications thrown into disarray
About a week after Trump signed the order, Secretary of State Marco Rubio suspended  passport applications of Americans who chose X as their gender or who were trying to update their document's gender marker. Now, under new policies, the State Department will only issue passports that say male or female and that match the applicant's sex at birth. The State Department did not respond to NPR's questions about the new policies and their enforcement. NPR spoke to LGBTQ+ advocates as well as seven people who identify as trans, nonbinary or intersex who have been directly impacted by the changed passport policy or who have put plans to apply for a new passport and to travel on hold as a result of the confusing new rules.

In Louie's case, he received a new passport with the correct name change. But the gender marker was still ""female,"" like his old passport. Louie says he wasn't surprised, given the State Department's policy changes, but is still upset and frustrated and unsure what it means for him. (Euphoria actress Hunter Schafer shared on TikTok that she also received a new passport that reflected her sex assigned at birth, not her current gender marker, which is on her other documents.)

Louie is now rethinking his international travel destinations and is concerned about how even interactions in the U.S. with law enforcement, for example, could become a problem when his passport lists one gender and his other legal documents another.

Trump's passport policy already faces at least one federal lawsuit by the American Civil Liberties Union. It argues that the executive order and passport policy are unlawful, unconstitutional and ""unmoored from scientific and medical reality.""

The American Medical Association supports policies ""that allow for a sex designation or change of designation on all government IDs to reflect an individual's gender identity, as reported by the individual."" Designating sex as either male or female only fails to factor in ""the medical spectrum of gender identity,"" risks stifling an individuals' self-expression and contributes to marginalization, the organization says. What were the old passport policies?
The ability for people to change the sex field on their passports from male to female or vice versa has been allowed since 2010, including through the first Trump administration. To qualify for that change, a doctor had to certify that the applicant was being treated for gender transition. In 2021, the State Department allowed people to make those changes without doctor certification and permitted applicants to select a third gender option, X, on their passport — after years of litigation. Thousands of gender X passports are believed to be in circulation now, but the State Department has not given a specific number.

Many countries such as Canada, Australia, India and New Zealand allow the ""X"" designation on their passports. Dozens of states already allow residents to update their driver's licenses to reflect their gender identity, with ""X"" being a gender marker option in 22 states and the District of Columbia. At least 16 states and D.C. allow an X gender marker option for updated birth certificates.

With the new passport policy in place, legal and advocacy groups say they are hearing from people like Louie who have received passports with the wrong gender markers and some whose passports and other legal documents are being held by the State Department.

Passports withheld, questions unanswered
All of these issues have left people like Westley Ebling with passport applications in a state of limbo, with no word from the State Department, and important documents, like old passports and birth certificates, withheld.

Ebling, a 26-year-old in Washington, D.C., submitted his passport renewal application with a gender marker change from female to male on Jan. 15. The application was received on Jan. 22, shortly after Trump issued his executive order.

Ebling wondered what this would mean for him, and when he contacted the office of his congressional representative, Democratic Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton, he was told passport applications with gender changes were being suspended indefinitely.

""That's all the information I have,"" Ebling says. So for now, he doesn't have a new passport and his old one hasn't been returned. He and his partner have put travel plans on hold, he says.

Intersex Americans face particular challenges
The policy changes are having a profound impact on intersex people — those born with genitalia, chromosomes or reproductive organs that don't fit typical definitions for males or females — says Erika Lorshbough, the executive director of interACT, a nonprofit that advocates for the legal and civil rights of people with intersex traits.

Under Trump's Jan. 20 executive order — titled ""Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government"" — the federal government now views ""female"" as meaning ""a person belonging, at conception, to the sex that produces the large reproductive cell"" and male as ""a person belonging, at conception, to the sex that produces the small reproductive cell.""

Intersex people, by definition, cannot fall into these categories, Lorshbough says.

""For folks in the intersex community, visibility has always been an issue. Every time you're trying to define sex in these perfectly binary terms, you're going to impact intersex people who, by definition, don't present with perfectly binary sex,"" Lorshbough says.

Some intersex people are assigned a sex at birth that doesn't match their development later in life, Lorshbough says. The addition of the X gender marker as an option on official documents helped intersex people feel better represented, she says.

So, what happens to intersex people looking to get or update a passport now?

It's unclear for Jennifer Sensiba, who lives in New Mexico. Sensiba, 40, is intersex and was assigned male at birth.

""It became obvious when I was a teenager and young adult that I wasn't actually male. This was fine by me, because I never felt right in a male gender role,"" Sensiba wrote in an email to NPR. ""I was often mistaken for a transgender man, and was sometimes accused of being a woman pretending to be a man in those days.""

Sensiba eventually changed how she identifies, changed her name legally and updated her gender marker on her driver's license and other IDs. But her birth certificate is still unchanged, so she has ""mixed paperwork,"" as she calls it. As a young adult, Sensiba had a passport under her old name, but it has long since expired. She'd have to apply all over again for a new passport.

""From what I've been reading, if there's any discrepancy in paperwork, they go with the birth certificate,"" she said.

She's tried to get answers from her local congressman, but has heard nothing. The fact that these policy decisions have pulled her and other intersex people in a black hole, shows the federal government is ""trying to regulate an issue that they know nothing about,"" she says. Despite the chaos, uncertainty and fear people are feeling in the face of these changes, many say they will continue to live their lives as they have for years.

""These laws, executive orders, attempts to legislate trans people out of existence won't work,"" Louie, from New York, says. ""We've won our rights over decades and we've existed before we were legally recognized by the state and we will continue to do so regardless of that."""
2/1/2025,Some federal web pages still down as agencies implement order 'defending women',https://www.npr.org/2025/01/31/g-s1-45887/trump-opm-gender-ideology-defending-women-websites-transgender,NPR,"
Danielle Kurtzleben",Pro ,4,"This week, the Trump administration instructed all federal agencies to remove information from their websites pertaining to ""gender ideology."" On Friday, a flurry of reports indicated that exact thing was happening.

In a Wednesday memo, Office of Personnel Management Acting Director Charles Ezell instructed agencies to comply by Friday at 5 p.m. ET with an executive order that says its aim is ""defending women from gender ideology extremism.""

That memo laid out ""steps to end federal funding of gender ideology."" Among those was the instruction to ""Take down all outward facing media (websites, social media accounts, etc.) that inculcate or promote gender ideology."" While ""gender ideology"" is not sharply defined, Trump and other transgender rights opponents have used the phrase to argue against the idea that people can identify with a gender that does not match the sex they were assigned at birth.

Indeed, the executive order calls it a ""false claim that males can identify as and thus become women and vice versa."" For a time on Friday evening, the entire Census.gov website returned an error message. Attempting to reach the Census Bureau's 2020 Results page showed part of the site was down for maintenance. Its page on sexual orientation and gender identity was still down early Saturday afternoon.

The examples proliferated on social media, with academics, journalists and activists noting that basic information had disappeared from government websites. The CDC's HIV surveillance data disappeared, as noted by Aaron Richterman, a scientist at the University of Pennsylvania. Similarly, the CDC's Youth Risk Survey data is no longer accessible, which KFF's Cynthia Cox pointed out.

""OPM sent guidance to agencies to remove gender ideology-related content from their websites by 5 pm today as part of the efforts to defend women and uphold the truth of biological sex against the radical claims of gender activists,"" OPM communications director McLaurine Pinover said in a statement Friday evening. ""This may have been misinterpreted to mean we would shut down government websites who weren't able to comply but that is not the plan for continuing to implement this important effort."" Many who support transgender rights oppose using the phrase ""gender ideology,"" as it implies that being transgender is a belief system, as opposed to an identity. Nearly 2 million Americans identify as trans or transgender, according to 2023 polling from KFF and Washington Post.

This week's ""gender ideology"" memo wasn't the only order from the Trump administration to remove information from websites. In another memo implementing an executive order aimed at ""ending radical and wasteful government DEI programs,"" Ezell instructed agencies to ""Take down all outward facing media (websites, social media accounts, etc.) of DEIA offices."" DEIA stands for ""diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility"" in this order. When asked Friday about the removal of ""DEI"" information from websites, Trump said, ""It doesn't sound like a bad idea to me. DEI would have ruined our country, and now it's dead.""

The ""Defending Women"" executive order, and Ezell's resulting memo, go well beyond policing information on government websites. Ezell also instructed agencies to ""review all agency programs, contracts, and grants, and terminate any that promote or inculcate gender ideology,"" and also to make sure that forms ask for respondents' ""sex"" and not their ""gender.""

The memo additionally calls on agencies to make sure that ""intimate spaces"" are ""designated by biological sex and not gender identity,"" which could mean transgender and nonbinary employees will be restricted in which bathrooms they use. NPR reached out for clarity on which spaces would be considered ""intimate spaces"" and did not receive a response."
1/28/2025,Trump has issued a number of orders affecting the military. Here's what they do,https://www.npr.org/2025/01/28/nx-s1-5277155/trump-military-transgender-dei-iron-dome-orders,NPR,Tom Bowman,Pro ,19,"On the abolishment of DEI (Diversity, Equity and Inclusion) programs within the Department of Defense, Trump officials continue to use buzzwords like ""woke"" to describe the military. But military officials say it's either wrong or an exaggeration. In December, then-Army Secretary Christine Wormuth told NPR, ""We spend one hour in basic training on equal opportunity training, and we spend something like 95 hours on rifle marksmanship. We are focused on being lethal, being ready to win wars, and I think anyone who comes to our units, that's what they'll see our soldiers focused on.""

The U.S. military has long said its fighting force should look like America, with all races and ethnicities included in the ranks at all levels. Military officials have long tried to make its officer corps more diverse. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth — as a commentator and writer — criticized Joint Chiefs Chairman CQ Brown, who is Black, for pursuing DEI policies, saying he should be fired. But this week when asked if Brown would remain, Hegseth said they would work together. So a question for Secretary Hegseth is: Who do you believe got a senior job because of diversity and would you fire them?

Prioritizing military excellence and readiness: This order contends that service members with gender dysphoria and those with ""shifting pronoun usage or use of pronouns that inaccurately reflect an individual's sex"" are unfit to serve in the military. Advocates say there are about 15,000 transgender troops among the 2.3 million service members. Fewer than 2,000 have been diagnosed with gender dysphoria or had surgeries. Nonetheless, the executive order speaks of transgender identity in sweeping and dismissive terms, and sets the stage for a policy that is more restrictive and punitive than the ban from Trump's first term."
12/4/2024,Montana lawmakers cross the aisle to block a trans bathroom ban in the state capitol,https://www.npr.org/2024/12/04/nx-s1-5215668/montana-transgender-bathroom-ban-zooey-zephyr,NPR,Rachel Treisman,Pro ,14,"Lawmakers in Montana crossed party lines this week to reject a measure that would have banned a transgender representative from using the women's bathroom at the state Capitol.

Several Republicans joined all Democrats in voting against the proposal at a meeting of the Joint House and Senate Rules Committees on Tuesday.

The proposed rule would have designated two bathrooms — located between the House and Senate chambers — as male and female and required legislators to use the one that aligned with their sex chromosomes at birth.

""It says what probably shouldn't need to be said and puts in the rules what probably shouldn't need to be put in the rules … that the gals' restroom will be used only by gals and the guys' restroom will be used only by [guys],"" Republican Rep. Jerry Schillinger, who proposed the measure, said at Tuesday's meeting.

The lawmakers did not name names but implied that the rule was aimed at Democratic Rep. Zooey Zephyr, who was elected the state's first transgender legislator in 2022 and won a second term last month.

This wouldn't be Montana Republicans' first time singling out Zephyr: They voted in April 2023 to sanction and silence her from floor debates for breaking decorum, after she said lawmakers who supported a ban on gender-affirming healthcare for minors would have ""blood on your hands."" (While her banishment ended with the 2023 session, she has yet to return since the legislature did not meet in 2024.) ""Understand that we have one representative right now but in the future, we could have many,"" Republican Rep. Jedediah Hinkle, a supporter of the measure, said on Tuesday. ""This could be an ongoing thing.""

During the nearly 15-minute discussion — in which no women participated — lawmakers in favor of the rule said it would safeguard women's spaces, while those opposed questioned its utility and how it would be enforced.

Critics also maintained that the accommodations made during the legislature's last session — adding locks to the nearby bathrooms' outer doors — had already addressed members' concerns. And two Republican members worried that the measure itself would be a distraction. ""This particular action will have the effect of making people famous in the national news and will not contribute to the effective conduct of our business,"" said Republican Rep. David Bedey, who opposed the bill ""reluctantly"" despite his personal views on the topic.

The proposal, which needed support from a majority of both committees, passed in the Senate committee but ultimately failed in the House committee by a vote of 10-12. Zephyr celebrated the outcome on social media.

""I'm happy to see that this proposed ban failed and am grateful for my colleagues — particularly my republican colleagues — who recognized this as a distraction from the work we were elected to do,"" she posted on X. ""I'm ready to represent my constituents & look forward to working on behalf of Montana."" A similar conversation has been playing out in Congress
On Tuesday, Hinkle — one of the Montana rule's Republican supporters — acknowledged that the issue has been in the national spotlight.

""I think it's time that this body addresses this issue now as they are addressing it nationally,"" he said.

The Montana measure came right after a similar conversation arose in the nation's Capital — but ended in a very different outcome. In early November, Democratic Rep.-elect Sarah McBride of Delaware became the first openly transgender person elected to Congress.

Weeks later, Republican Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina introduced a measure that would ban transgender women from using facilities in the Capitol building that do not correspond with their sex at birth. Mace later followed up with legislation that would extend to all facilities on federal property.

House Speaker Mike Johnson hasn't commented on a plan to vote on those measures, but released a clarification saying all single-sex facilities in the Capitol and House Office Buildings are ""reserved for individuals of that biological sex.""

McBride — like many of her soon-to-be Democratic colleagues — criticized the ordeal as a distraction, but said she will comply with the rules Johnson outlined.

""I'm not here to fight about bathrooms,"" tweeted McBride, who will take office in January. ""I'm here to fight for Delawareans and to bring down costs facing families."""
1/22/2025,"Trump's Executive Orders Promoting Sex Discrimination, Explained",https://www.aclu.org/news/lgbtq-rights/trumps-executive-orders-promoting-sex-discrimination-explained,ACLU,Gillian Branstetter,Pro ,"3, 10","Donald Trump was re-elected president on a wave of attacks against women and transgender people. Anti-transgender politicians spent more than $215 million on ads scapegoating trans people and promoting a Project 2025 agenda that threatens to rollback reproductive freedom and punish people for departing from archaic gender roles. On his first day back in office, President Trump signed a far-reaching executive order requiring federal agencies to discriminate against transgender people by denying who they are and threatening the freedom of self-determination and self-expression for all.

In 2020, the Supreme Court issued a 6-3 ruling in Bostock v. Clayton County affirming that discrimination against someone because they are LGBTQ is sex discrimination under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Justice Neil Gorsuch, writing for the majority, said: “it is impossible to discriminate against a person for being homosexual or transgender without discriminating against that individual based on sex.” Trump also withdrew an executive order issued by former President Joe Biden directing federal agencies to enforce this court ruling as applied to all laws prohibiting sex discrimination.

We all deserve the freedom to be ourselves, including the right to determine what’s right for our bodies and lives. Trump’s sex discrimination mandate threatens to deny that freedom to transgender people across the country while forcing everyone else to sacrifice their own freedom and privacy, too.

What Does the Order Say?
Trump’s signed order states: “It is the policy of the United States to recognize two sexes, male and female.  These sexes are not changeable and are grounded in fundamental and incontrovertible reality.” The order defines terms like “man” and “woman” based on whether a person “at conception” belongs “to the sex that produces the large reproductive cell” or that “produces the small reproductive cell.”

Trump’s order then directs federal agencies to “enforce laws governing sex-based rights, protections, opportunities, and accommodations” using his cramped definitions, including designating sex on passports and other federal identification documents, or determining where transgender people are confined in federal custody. The order also includes a sweeping mandate to all agencies to “end the Federal funding of gender ideology.” Of course, the order does not explain what that means or how agencies would accomplish such a task.

For decades, feminist legal scholars and women’s rights advocates have opposed efforts to define gender based strictly on biology. Recent state laws that use these definitions to discriminate against transgender people have resulted in invasive and traumatizing efforts to determine who “counts” as a man or as a woman, targeting youth who are even suspected of being transgender because they do not conform to sex stereotypes. This order likewise ignores the existence of intersex people and others with variations in sex characteristics beyond the overly-simplistic definitions Trump endorsed.

What Does the Order Do?
Very few executive orders change policy immediately, and they cannot change laws passed by Congress or protections guaranteed by the Constitution. As of January 21, 2025 it is unclear how the Trump administration will enforce this order as applied to educational settings, health care access, housing, federally-funded programs, and many other areas where federal law or policy references “sex” or “gender.”

Some of the most immediate impacts will likely be felt by the more than 2,000 transgender people currently held in federal custody. The order specifically calls on the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to ignore the guidelines of the Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA) and enforce a blanket policy forcing transgender women into men’s prisons and detention centers against their will. This puts them at a severely heightened risk of sexual assault and abuse by other incarcerated persons and prison staff. The order also mandates that BOP withdraw critical health care from trans people in federal prison.

We also expect to see immediate impacts on access to updated sex designations on U.S. passports. Transgender people frequently update the sex designation on documents like birth certificates, driver’s licenses, and passports to reflect their gender identity rather than the sex they were assigned at birth. Requiring transgender peoples’ passports to show the sex they were assigned at birth effectively outs them as transgender whenever they have to present the document.

Soon after the order was issued, a Trump administration official told a reporter that the policy impacting gender markers on U.S. passports would not apply retroactively for current passport holders. Trump’s order will, however, prevent transgender and intersex people from obtaining new passports, visas, and trusted traveler documents that reflect who they are and how they are perceived in the world.

The State Department recently said that all applications for gender change are ""suspended."" Because people have to provide their existing passport and other documents to update their passport, if people attempt to update the sex designation on their passport now, they run the risk of not having a valid passport at all while the passport is out of their possession.

What Happens Next?
We expect the order may be enforced in other contexts, such as in public schools and sex-separated spaces. It may also be used to limit workplace protections and to limit federally-funded programs that provide access for gender-affirming health care. If federal agencies and departments act to make those risks a reality, the ACLU and other LGBTQ rights organizations will fight them every step of the way.

If you have been impacted by this order, let us know."
11/16/2023,The Latest Must-Pass Bill Barreling Through Congress is an Attack on Gender-Affirming Care,https://www.aclu.org/news/lgbtq-rights/the-latest-must-pass-bill-barreling-through-congress-is-an-attack-on-gender-affirming-care,ACLU,Rio Matsumoto,Pro ,5,"The fiscal year 2024 appropriations process has been littered with anti-LGBTQ attacks. Republican members of the House of Representatives have inserted anti-LGBTQ provisions into all 12 of the must-pass appropriations bills. These riders include restrictions on gender-affirming care, allowances for discrimination against same-sex couples, prohibitions of drag performances, banning of pride flag displays, and restrictions on diversity and inclusion programs.

These harmful anti-LGBTQ provisions come at a time when legislative attacks against the LGBTQ community are at an all-time high. As of this month, 506 anti-LGBTQ bills have been introduced in state legislatures this year alone. Bills such as the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act, which would prohibit transgender students from participating in sports teams that align with their gender identity, have been introduced in the House of Representatives at alarming rates. In fact, the House has already passed other pieces of legislation that are considered to be must-pass bills, such as the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2024, with provisions that ban gender-affirming care, drag performances, and pride flag displays. Out of all the appropriations bills, however, the Labor, Health, and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill for FY 2024 is arguably the most nefarious and dangerous for the transgender community. The anti-LGBTQ riders in this bill seek to prohibit funds from being used for implementing anti-discrimination and equity programs, taking discriminatory action against anyone that speaks or acts in accordance with the belief that marriage is between a man and a woman, or displaying pride flags. Section 534 of this bill would also prohibit funds from being used for gender-affirming surgical procedures or hormone therapies. If passed, this will have extensive, damaging effects.

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) is an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, one of the departments funded by the Labor-HHS Appropriations Bill. CMS provides health coverage through Medicaid to about 84.5 million enrollees as of July 2023, including eligible low-income adults. Currently, Medicaid is one the largest payers for health care in the United States. As of December 2022, about 276,000 transgender people in the United States are enrolled in Medicaid and about 60 percent of these beneficiaries reside in states or territories where Medicaid programs specifically include coverage for gender-affirming care, including hormone therapy, surgical procedures, and other gender-affirming treatments. Another 27 percent of transgender Medicaid beneficiaries live in states where laws are silent or unclear on coverage for gender-affirming care. In 14 states, laws do not include express statutes or policies addressing gender-affirming care under Medicaid. In four additional states, policies explicitly exclude this care under state Medicaid programs, but actions by state legislatures, officials, and courts have indicated that these states have inconsistently enforced or may not be enforcing these policies. Unfortunately, about 14 percent of transgender Medicaid beneficiaries reside in states that expressly ban access to gender-affirming care covered by Medicaid.

This 14 percent will grow drastically with the passage of the Labor-HHS Appropriations Bill. Without funding for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Medicaid programs will be unable to cover gender-affirming surgical programs or hormone therapies for thousands of transgender people, many of whom are low-income.

Not only will too many lack the sufficient funds to turn to private medical programs or services, but states are also increasingly introducing and passing restrictions on gender-affirming care across the country. There are currently 135 state bills targeting health care for transgender people, many of which seek to ban gender-affirming care, establish criminal penalties for providing such care, or block funding to medical centers that offer this life-saving care."
9/16/2024,Free Speech Coalition Urges Supreme Court to Strike Down Texas’ Unconstitutional Age Verification Law,https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/free-speech-coalition-urges-supreme-court-to-strike-down-texas-unconstitutional-age-verification-law,ACLU,None listed,Pro ,2,"The American Civil Liberties Union, ACLU of Texas, and Quinn Emanuel today filed a brief in the Supreme Court on behalf of the Free Speech Coalition (FSC) and other plaintiffs in Free Speech Coalition v. Paxton, arguing that the age verification provision in Texas’s H.B 1181 violates the First Amendment by improperly burdening adults’ right to access sexual content online.

H.B. 1181 requires any website that publishes content one-third or more of which is “harmful to minors” — a broad category that includes virtually any explicit content — to force their visitors to provide digital IDs or other proof of age before they can access the published material, regardless of what is on the other two-thirds of the site.

“Adults in America have a First Amendment right to read about sexual health, see R-rated movies, watch porn, and otherwise access information about sex if they want to. They should be allowed to exercise that right as they see fit, without having to worry about exposing their personal identifying information in the process,” said Vera Eidelman, staff attorney with the ACLU Speech, Privacy and Technology Project. “Rather than requiring adults to give up their privacy in order to watch and read content the government doesn’t like, legislators should focus on shaping a safer internet through things like voluntary content filters, which give control to people, not the government.”

Texas claims this provision is about protecting minors from accessing sexual content deemed harmful to them, not regulating disfavored content, but it does not merely restrict minors’ access. It also restricts adults’ access, requiring them to identify themselves online and burdening their ability to exercise their First Amendment rights to see sexual content or any other material on a regulated site. As the brief explains, requiring individuals to verify their ages before accessing this protected speech robs people of anonymity, and threatens to bar individuals—for example, those who lack government identification or whose age is misidentified by the relevant technology—from accessing certain websites altogether. Such a restriction is not necessary given the availability of other options, like content filtering, that could accomplish the government’s goal while imposing less of a burden on speech.

“While Texas’ law may sound reasonable on its face, in practice, it is extraordinarily burdensome and invasive, effectively deterring adults from accessing legal content,” said Alison Boden, executive director of the Free Speech Coalition. “To make matters worse, this law – and ones like it – fail at their stated goal of protecting children online, despite forcing adult content creators and consumers to operate under the threat of surveillance and censorship.”

At the same time, the law will not accomplish its stated goal. Because the law only applies if one-third of a site’s content is explicit, social media sites that offer much of the same content, but as a smaller proportion of their total offerings, avoid the law’s requirement. And search engines are exempted entirely, meaning minors can access exactly the same sexual content online via such sites. Moreover, the law’s requirement that regulated sites issue unscientific health warnings about the negative effects of exposure to pornography illustrate the state’s distaste for the regulated speakers.

Before the case reached the Supreme Court, a district court briefly blocked the law from being enforced, concluding that the law’s age verification provision would unconstitutionally chill the speech of adults. However, a divided Fifth Circuit panel vacated that injunction, reasoning that the age verification provisions’ burden on adults’ First Amendment rights merely has to have some rational basis–not face strict scrutiny–because the aim is to protect children. Unless the Supreme Court issues a reversal, this decision will overturn decades of precedent protecting the free speech rights of adults.

In prior cases brought by the ACLU, the Supreme Court has repeatedly held that requiring users to verify their age to access protected content is unconstitutional where there are less restrictive alternatives available, like filtering software. In Reno v. ACLU, the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that anti-indecency provisions of the 1996 Communications Decency Act, also meant to protect children, violated the First Amendment's guarantee of freedom of speech in part because of the burden it imposed on adults. In Ashcroft v. ACLU, the Court held that a law almost identical to the Texas law had to satisfy strict scrutiny because it restricted adults’ access to protected sexual speech. Where a less-restrictive alternative exists—for example, the voluntary installation of filtering software on minors’ devices—the government cannot impose age verification on adults in the name of protecting children.

Free Speech Coalition v. Paxton is one of several cases in which the ACLU has urged courts to reject age verification schemes that would burden the free speech rights of internet users as part of the organization’s long tradition of defending online free expression."
4/18/2025,Federal judge blocks Trump’s passport policy affecting transgender Americans,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/federal-judge-blocks-trumps-passport-policy-affecting-transgender-americans,PBS,Michael Casey,Pro ,6,"A federal judge on Friday blocked the Trump administration from enacting a policy that bans the use of “X” marker used by many nonbinary people on passports as well as the changing of gender markers.

In an executive order signed in January, the president used a narrow definition of the sexes instead of a broader conception of gender. The order says a person is male or female and it rejects the idea that someone can transition from the sex assigned at birth to another gender. The framing is in line with many conservatives’ views but at odds with major medical groups and policies under former President Joe Biden.

U.S. District Judge Julia Kobick, who was appointed by President Joe Biden, sided with the American Civil Liberties Union’s motion for a preliminary injunction, which stays the action while the lawsuit plays out.

“The Executive Order and the Passport Policy on their face classify passport applicants on the basis of sex and thus must be reviewed under intermediate judicial scrutiny,” Kobick wrote. “That standard requires the government to demonstrate that its actions are substantially related to an important governmental interest. The government has failed to meet this standard.”

The ACLU, which sued the Trump administration on behalf of five transgender Americans and two nonbinary plaintiffs, said the new policy would effectively mean transgender, nonbinary and intersex Americans could not get an accurate passport.

“We all have a right to accurate identity documents, and this policy invites harassment, discrimination, and violence against transgender Americans who can no longer obtain or renew a passport that matches who they are,” ACLU lawyer Sruti Swaminathan said.

In response to the lawsuit, the Trump administration argued the passport policy change “does not violate the equal protection guarantees of the Constitution.” They also contended that the president has broad discretion in setting passport policy and that plaintiffs would not be harmed by the policy, since they are still free to travel abroad.

11/27/2024,Ohio Gov. DeWine signs bill restricting transgender students’ use of bathrooms,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/ohio-gov-dewine-signs-bill-restricting-transgender-students-use-of-bathrooms,PBS,"Julie Carr Smyth, Geoff Mulvihill",Pro ,14,"Transgender students from kindergarten through college at Ohio public and private schools will be banned from using multiperson bathrooms that fit their gender identities under a measure that Republican Gov. Mike DeWine said Wednesday that he has signed.

WATCH: Transgender Americans share concerns about Trump’s threats to rollback rights

DeWine signed the law out of public view Tuesday over the objections of Democrats, teachers’ unions and civil rights groups, which had hoped that his objections to a ban on gender-affirming care for minors last year would carry through and prompt another veto. It takes effect in 90 days.

The governor issued no statement regarding the signing.

The Republican-backed measure — labeled the “Protect All Students Act” — requires public and private schools, colleges and universities to designate separate bathrooms, locker rooms and overnight accommodations “for the exclusive use” of either males and females, based on one’s gender assigned at or near birth, in school buildings and other facilities used for school-sponsored events. It contains no enforcement mechanism.

“It revolves around safety, security, and, I think, common sense. It protects our children and grandchildren in private spaces where they are most vulnerable,” said Republican Ohio state Sen. Jerry Cirino, the bill’s sponsor.

School employees, emergency situations and people assisting young children or someone with a disability are exempted from the restrictions and schools can still offer single-use or family bathrooms.

Aaron Baer, president of the Center for Christian Virtue, which backed the bill, said in a statement, “Common sense is on a winning streak in America today. No student should be forced to go into the bathroom or locker room with a student of the opposite sex, and Ohio’s kids are better protected now because of Governor DeWine’s decision to sign this bill.”

The ACLU of Ohio was among the groups that had lobbied for a veto, condemning the measure as a violation of the right of privacy of LGBTQ+ Ohioans that will make them less safe.

Equality Ohio, the state’s LGBTQ+ advocacy and legal aid organization, said the law poses risks to transgender youth “or anyone perceived as transgender by authorities.”

“We are deeply disappointed that Governor DeWine has allowed this dangerous bill to become law that puts vulnerable trans youth at risk for abuse and harassment,” Executive Director Dwayne Steward said in a statement. The group said it will continue to fight “for a state that embraces and respects all its residents.”

With DeWine’s signature, Ohio adds to the pushback that’s cropped up nationally among many Republican politicians, including President-elect Donald Trump, as transgender people have gained more visibility and acceptance on some fronts in recent years.

Twenty-six states have now adopted laws restarting or banning gender-affirming care for transgender minors. The U.S. Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments Dec. 4 on whether Tennessee’s ban on such treatments can continue to be enforced; any ruling is likely to impact policies in other states, too.

At least 11 states have adopted laws, like Ohio’s, barring transgender girls and women from girls and women’s bathrooms at public schools – and in some cases, in other government facilities.

And at least 24 states have laws dictating which sports competitions transgender girls and women can join.

Ohio’s bathroom bill was debated for 19 months before finally clearing the GOP-led Legislature on Nov. 13, during Transgender Awareness Week. It was tacked onto a separate piece of legislation by the Ohio House that related to the state’s College Credit Plus program, which allows high-schoolers to earn college credit.

Trump’s campaign leaned heavily into opposing transgender rights in the last weeks of his race against Vice President Kamala Harris, including Trump’s vow at a Madison Square Garden rally that “we will keep men out of women’s sports” and campaign ads saying, “Kamala’s for they/them. President Trump is for you.”

WATCH: Why anti-transgender political ads are dominating the airwaves this election

It’s not clear what policies Trump might adopt once he takes office in January. But bills relating to gender issues are already being queued up in state legislatures that come into session early in 2025.

In Texas, for instance, there are proposed measures to bar using state money to pay for “gender reassignment,” to use state money to pay to reverse gender transitions, and to give people who receive gender-affirming care before they turn 15 until they turn 25 to sue their doctors for malpractice, among others. Democrats in the Republican-dominated legislature there have also introduced some bills intended to protect people from discrimination on the basis of “gender identity or expression.”

In Ohio, a law that both bars gender-affirming care for minors and blocks transgender girls and women from participating in girls and women’s sports competitions took effect in August. It took a rocky path, though. The measure became law only after the legislature overrode DeWine’s veto. And after that, a judge put enforcement on hold for about four months before allowing it."
