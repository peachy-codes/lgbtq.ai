if enforced, president trump’s order will deny transgender youth access to medically-necessary care, like puberty blockers and hormone therapy, even as these same treatments remain readily available to their cisgender peers. the order also intends to cut or reduce federal funding for health care providers who refuse to prioritize the trump administration’s political preferences over their patients’ medical needs. at the american civil liberties union, we know that politics and partisanship have no place in patient care and we all deserve the freedom to be ourselves. on february 4th, alongside lambda legal and the aclu of maryland, we sued the trump administration to block its discriminatory efforts to limit needed health care. we filed our suit on behalf of transgender young adults and their families, as well as pflag and glma, two of the nation’s largest organizations supporting lgbtq+ people and healthcare professionals.

since his first term, trump and his administration have carried out a years-long effort to roll back protections for lgbtq people. beginning in january, the trump administration issued a series of executive orders that remove protections for trans people. his directives include targeting transgender students, banning trans americans from military service, and giving federal agencies the green light to openly discriminate against their trans employees. these orders align with the extremist vision of project 2025, a sweeping right-wing agenda that seeks to dismantle civil rights protections, consolidate presidential power, and dehumanize transgender people. president trump “is determined to use every level of government to drive transgender people out of public life,” says joshua block, senior counsel for the aclu’s lgbt & hiv project. for cameron, gabe, and robert, three of the five trans young people challenging the trump administration’s anti-trans agenda, this fight goes beyond the courtroom. it’s about their fundamental right to make deeply personal medical decisions without government interference.

for cameron, words like “boy” or “girl” were never meaningful. being seen as nonbinary makes them feel “strong, happy, recognized, and loved.” before puberty, they worried about how others would treat them based on their clothes and pronouns. now, as their physical-self matures, cameron worries about how they see their own body. “the changes feel violating,” they say. “it makes me depressed, stressed, and anxious.”

after seeing a therapist, cameron’s parents consulted a doctor who first spoke to them about puberty blockers, a temporary pause that gives people time to decide whether to undergo male or female puberty. getting more time was a relief to cameron who, after starting treatment at 12, remembers feeling ""less stressed and a little more hopeful."" however, cameron’s appointment for a puberty-blocking implant was abruptly canceled after the trump administration issued its executive order. their anxieties came rushing back, resulting in stomach pain, restless sleep, and missed school. their parents fought to find a new doctor. though cameron did finally receive their implant, they fear losing care again. “i do not want to feel like a stranger in my body,” they told the aclu.

for gabe, a 14-year-old transgender boy, he hopes gender-affirming medical care will help him look and sound more like himself. often, when strangers see him in public, they address him using male pronouns. until he speaks. his voice still does not reflect who he is and causes people to misgender him, which only adds to the anxiety and dysmorphia that began when he started puberty.

“even when i wasn’t sure why the changes felt wrong, i just knew they were,” gabe says, reflecting on his experience trying to navigate his changing body.

to treat his dysphoria, gabe’s parents consulted a doctor who explained how testosterone could help him feel more comfortable in his body. gabe knew it was the right choice for him. “i want to be in a grown-up male body when i’m older,” he says. “i want the choice to tell people, not to be revealed by my voice.”

gabe hoped to begin testosterone treatments in march 2025, but the administration’s actions put his plans at risk. like many trans youth, gabe now fears that he won’t have the choice to present as he truly is.

families of trans youth also feel the impact of trump’s discriminatory order. rachel, a member of pflag, has always prioritized her son robert’s health and well-being. from a very early age, she knew that robert was meant to be a boy and that “he would thrive in school and the rest of his life if we let him live that way.”

at nine, robert was diagnosed with gender dysphoria. rachel made sure he received the care he needed. under medical guidance, he began puberty blockers to prevent changes that would conflict with his identity. by 14, after years of therapy and careful consideration, he started testosterone. “as his mother, i agreed with his doctors that robert would benefit from going through puberty alongside his peers,” rachel says.

robert is 16 now and is “healthy, social, and thriving.” but on january 29th, rachel received a call: robert’s appointment, a routine check-up for his hormone therapy, was canceled. “i am devastated that the president has sought to prevent my child from accessing the health care that allows him to be his true self,” rachel says.

without testosterone, rachel fears that robert will face severe distress. “this is a child who has told me since age two that he is a boy,” she says. “he is now a young man. it would be alarming for him to suddenly develop a woman’s body.”

cameron, robert, gabe, and so many families like theirs see president trump’s assault on their rights for what it is: an overreach of presidential power to deny them the health care that serves as the foundation of their lives and their future. at the aclu, we refuse to let politics dictate who can and cannot receive essential healthcare, but our fight is about more than policy. like all of us, trans youth deserve to grow up with the care and support they need. we will not stop fighting until their rights are protected.","['president', 'donald', 'trump', 'assault', 'transgender', 'right',

5ee886ac-3f21-42b5-b842-aeb2916552d6,pro,perkins et al. v. state (hb 121),"['perkin', 'et', 'al', 'state', 'hb']",aclu,none listed,https://www.aclu.org/cases/perkins-et-al-v-state,4/3/25,"hb 121, which took effect on march 27, 2025, is a draconian law that singles out transgender and intersex people for dehumanizing and discriminatory treatment. it bars transgender people from using public restrooms, changing rooms, and sleeping quarters that correspond to their gender identity in a sweeping range of public spaces—including offices, libraries, universities, state parks, and hospitals. hb 121 also imposes a restrictive binary definition of “sex” which fails to recognize intersex people, who are born with a combination of male and female sex traits. as a result, under hb 121, intersex people apparently cannot use regulated sex-separated facilities at all. what is more, hb 121 subjects regulated entities to potentially severe legal liability: any person who “encounter[s] another individual of the opposite sex” in a restroom or changing room—including a transgender individual using a facility consistent with their gender identity—can sue the entity where the encounter took place.

the aclu’s state supreme court initiative, along with the aclu of montana and legal voice, have brought suit against the state of montana, governor gianforte, and attorney general knudsen on behalf of a group of transgender and intersex plaintiffs. each of the plaintiffs is a montanan who—like any other montanan—needs access to public buildings and spaces to work, go to school, seek healthcare, and enjoy recreation, among other things. but, under hb 121, they would not be allowed access to such spaces on equal terms with everyone else. because they are denied access to restrooms and other sex-separated facilities, the plaintiffs and other transgender and intersex people may not be able to continue working, studying, or participating in public life.

our lawsuit argues that the montana constitution prohibits this discrimination. the montana constitution provides robust protections for individual rights and liberties that in some respects exceeds the protections afforded by the u.s. constitution. we allege that hb 121 violates montana’s constitutional guarantees of equal protection under the law, privacy, and due process, as well as every montanan’s constitutional right to pursue life’s basic necessities. at this initial stage of the case, we are asking the court to enter a preliminary injunction preventing the state from enforcing hb 121 while litigation is ongoing because of the immediate and irreparable harm that the law would inflict on transgender and intersex people.","['hb', 'take', 'effect', 'march', 'draconian', 'law', 'single', 'transgender', 'intersex', 'people', 'dehumanizing', 'discriminatory', 'treatment', 'bar', 'transgend', 'people', 'public', 'restroom', 'change', 'room', 'sleeping', 'quarter', 'correspond', 'gender', 'identity', 'sweeping', 'range', 'public', 'space', 'include', 'office', 'library', 'university', 'state', 'park', 'hospital', 'hb', 'impose', 'restrictive', 'binary', 'definition', 'sex', 'fail', 'recognize', 'intersex', 'people', 'bear', 'combination', 'male', 'female', 'sex', 'trait', 'result', 'hb', 'intersex', 'people', 'apparently', 'use', 'regulated', 'sex', 'separate', 'facility', 'hb', 'subject', 'regulate', 'entity', 'potentially', 'severe', 'legal', 'liability', 'person', 'individual', 'opposite', 'sex', 'restroom', 'change', 'room', 'include', 'transgender', 'individual', 'facility', 'consistent', 'gender', 'identity', 'sue', 'entity', 'encounter', 'take', 'place', 'aclu', 'state', 'supreme', 'court', 'initiative', 'aclu', 'montana', 'legal', 'voice', 'bring', 'suit', 'state', 'montana', 'governor', 'gianforte', 'attorney', 'general', 'knudsen', 'behalf', 'group', 'transgender', 'intersex', 'plaintiff', 'plaintiff', 'montanan', 'like', 'montanan', 'need', 'access', 'public', 'building', 'space', 'work', 'school', 'seek', 'healthcare', 'enjoy', 'recreation', 'thing', 'hb', 'allow', 'access', 'space', 'equal', 'term', 'deny', 'access', 'restroom', 'sex', 'separate', 'facility', 'plaintiff', 'transgender', 'intersex', 'people', 'able', 'continue', 'work', 'study', 'participate', 'public', 'life', 'lawsuit', 'argue', 'montana', 'constitution', 'prohibit', 'discrimination', 'montana', 'constitution', 'provide', 'robust', 'protection', 'individual', 'right', 'liberty', 'respect', 'exceed', 'protection', 'afford', 'constitution', 'allege', 'hb', 'violate', 'montana', 'constitutional', 'guarantee', 'equal', 'protection', 'law', 'privacy', 'process', 'montanan', 'constitutional', 'right', 'pursue', 'life', 'basic', 'necessity', 'initial', 'stage', 'case', 'ask', 'court', 'enter', 'preliminary', 'injunction', 'prevent', 'state', 'enforce', 'hb', 'litigation', 'ongoing', 'immediate', 'irreparable', 'harm', 'law', 'inflict', 'transgender', 'intersex', 'people']",
3fa9bb9d-ce25-4325-b91f-acd8d8ff192a,anti,montana senate endorses bill tying bathrooms to biological sex,"['montana', 'senate', 'endorse', 'bill', 'tie', 'bathroom', 'biological', 'sex']",kpax (local news),jonathon ambarian,https://www.kpax.com/news/montana-senate-endorses-bill-tying-bathrooms-to-biological-sex,2/11/2025,"a bill that would require transgender people in montana to use the bathroom that aligns with their sex at birth has cleared one of its last legislative hurdles before going to the governor.

the senate endorsed house bill 121 on a 32-18 party-line vote on monday, with all republicans in support and all democrats in opposition. during the debate on the senate floor, supporters said it was a commonsense measure, but opponents warned of unintended consequences. house bill 121 is sponsored by rep. kerri seekins-crowe, r-billings. it would require public schools, correctional facilities, other public buildings and domestic violence shelters to designate bathrooms, changing rooms and sleeping areas for either men or women, based on their biological sex at birth, and to “take reasonable steps” to keep the opposite sex out. someone could then sue those facilities if they failed to take those steps and someone of the opposite sex used the space.

the bill wouldn’t apply to rooms that only one person can use at a time.

republicans argued hb 121 was needed to protect single-sex spaces, particularly for women. they said it would address concerns about violence and harassment in places where women feel especially vulnerable. “it reinforces protection for women and children and as outlined, specific spaces for their privacy and well-being,” said sen. john fuller, r-kalispell. “and it's about clarity.”

democrats said transgender people aren’t a threat to women, and that hb 121 would create the same type of discomfort it’s trying to alleviate by requiring transgender men to use women’s bathrooms.

“this is not what the people of montana need,” said sen. cora neumann, d-bozeman. “they need you using their money wisely. they need you using our time wisely and voting on things that will actually make their lives better.”

they also argued facilities would have a hard time meeting the requirements of the bill. sen. laura smith, d-helena, proposed amending the bill to take effect in july instead of immediately when it’s signed into law. she said lawmakers have heard from shelters that say they may have to close if they don’t have more time to get into compliance.

“i don't know why we wouldn't say, ‘let's hold on, guys, let's give ourselves a second, let’s not harm vulnerable individuals who are in shelters or who are homeless in the middle of montana winter,’” smith said. smith’s motion to amend the bill failed on a 22-28 vote. supporters of the bill said they believed concerns about shelter closures were “red herrings.”

“if it's important, the governor can make an amendatory veto at a future date, and i would suggest lobbying him,” said fuller.

hb 121 passed the house last month. it is scheduled for a final vote in the senate on tuesday. once it passes, it will be on its way to gov. greg gianforte’s desk. the gianforte administration has already indicated support for the bill, with lt. gov. kristen juras testifying in favor of it.","['bill', 'require', 'transgend', 'people', 'montana', 'use', 'bathroom', 'align', 'sex', 'birth', 'clear', 'legislative', 'hurdle', 'go', 'governor', 'senate', 'endorsed', 'house', 'bill', 'party', 'line', 'vote', 'monday', 'republicans', 'support', 'democrats', 'opposition', 'debate', 'senate', 'floor', 'supporter', 'say', 'commonsense', 'measure', 'opponent', 'warn', 'unintended', 'consequence', 'house', 'bill', 'sponsor', 'rep', 'kerri', 'seekins', 'crowe', 'r', 'billing', 'require', 'public', 'school', 'correctional', 'facility', 'public', 'building', 'domestic', 'violence', 'shelter', 'designate', 'bathroom', 'change', 'room', 'sleeping', 'area', 'man', 'woman', 'base', 'biological', 'sex', 'birth', 'reasonable', 'step', 'opposite', 'sex', 'sue', 'facility', 'fail', 'step', 'opposite', 'sex', 'space', 'bill', 'apply', 'room', 'person', 'use', 'time', 'republicans', 'argue', 'hb', 'need', 'protect', 'single', 'sex', 'space', 'particularly', 'woman', 'say', 'address', 'concern', 'violence', 'harassment', 'place', 'woman', 'feel', 'especially', 'vulnerable', 'reinforce', 'protection', 'woman', 'child', 'outline', 'specific', 'space', 'privacy', 'say', 'sen', 'john', 'fuller', 'r', 'kalispell', 'clarity', 'democrats', 'say', 'transgender', 'people', 'threat', 'woman', 'hb', 'create', 'type', 'discomfort', 'try', 'alleviate', 'require', 'transgender', 'man', 'use', 'woman', 'bathroom', 'people', 'montana', 'need', 'say', 'sen', 'cora', 'neumann', 'd', 'bozeman', 'need', 'money', 'wisely', 'need', 'time', 'wisely', 'vote', 'thing', 'actually', 'life', 'well', 'argue', 'facility', 'hard', 'time', 'meet', 'requirement', 'bill', 'sen', 'laura', 'smith', 'd', 'helena', 'propose', 'amend', 'bill', 'effect', 'july', 'instead', 'immediately', 'sign', 'law', 'say', 'lawmaker', 'hear', 'shelter', 'close', 'time', 'compliance', 'know', 'let', 'hold', 'guy', 'let', 'second', 'let', 'harm', 'vulnerable', 'individual', 'shelter', 'homeless', 'middle', 'montana', 'winter', 'smith', 'say', 'smith', 'motion', 'amend', 'bill', 'fail', 'vote', 'supporter', 'bill', 'say', 'believe', 'concern', 'shelter', 'closure', 'red', 'herring', 'important', 'governor', 'amendatory', 'veto', 'future', 'date', 'suggest', 'lobby', 'say', 'fuller', 'hb', 'pass', 'house', 'month', 'schedule', 'final', 'vote', 'senate', 'tuesday', 'pass', 'way', 'gov', 'greg', 'gianforte', 'desk', 'gianforte', 'administration', 'indicate', 'support', 'bill', 'lt', 'gov', 'kristen', 'juras', 'testify', 'favor']",
e53c9e0b-0b98-4098-b1a4-867f306bcda4,pro,library patrons sue greenville county over widespread removals and restrictions of lgbtq books,"['library', 'patron', 'sue', 'greenville', 'county', 'widespread', 'removal', 'restriction', 'lgbtq', 'book']",aclu,none listed,https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/library-patrons-sue-greenville-county-over-widespread-removals-and-restrictions-of-lgbtq-books,3/26/25,"greenville, s.c. – local library patrons, with help from the american civil liberties union and aclu of south carolina, are suing officials in south carolina’s most populous county for systematically purging literature by and about lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (lgbtq) people from its public library collection.

the lawsuit asks a federal court to permanently block greenville county’s policies and practices that have deliberately hidden or removed dozens of books that positively portray transgender and gender-nonconforming people. the aclu and the aclu of south carolina filed the lawsuit today in the u.s. district court for the district of south carolina on behalf of families and residents of greenville county, arguing that county officials have violated library patrons’ first and fourteenth amendment rights.

""books are one of our greatest tools to learn about other peoples, the world around us, and more importantly to learn about ourselves through representation,” said greg rogers, a greenville county parent and plaintiff in the lawsuit. “all children and young adults should have equal access to these tools. keeping even one child from accessing the representation they provide is a travesty for the equality of all children.”

“for years, the library board has tried to censor patrons' access to diverse stories,” said stephen shelato, co-founder of freedom in libraries advocacy group (flag), a vibrant local library group that has lobbied hard against anti-lgbtq discrimination at the greenville library. “local parents believe that exposure to diverse stories is healthy and developmentally appropriate, but board members have repeatedly chosen instead to follow the demands of a loud minority of activists and partisan groups. local parents are now courageously speaking out and taking action—and they deserve the full support of our community.""

“greenville county cannot censor our public libraries merely because its officials find certain materials politically, morally, or religiously objectionable,” said allen chaney, legal director for the aclu of south carolina. “after years of public advocacy against these discriminatory actions, we must now rely on the courts to vindicate a simple truth: the constitution protects everyone, including lgbtq people.”

“greenville county’s policy is a blatant infringement on the rights we all share to learn, read, and speak as we please,” said shana knizhnik, senior staff attorney for the aclu’s jon l. stryker and slobodan randjelović lgbtq & hiv project. “decades of first amendment precedent protects the freedom of readers and community members like our plaintiffs, and nobody’s story is unacceptable simply because of who they are or who they love. across the country, communities like greenville are standing up and fighting back against efforts to push lgbtq people from public life, and we’re hopeful the court will see through these discriminatory acts of censorship.”

new policies adopted by the greenville county library board in 2024 require that all materials with “illustrations, themes, or story lines [that] affirm, portray, or discuss changing the appearance of a minor’s gender in ways inconsistent with the minor’s biological sex” or with “illustrations, themes, or storylines that celebrate, portray, or affirm gender transitioning” must be removed from the juvenile and young adult sections of the library. the library system has moved these books to adults-only sections of the library, limiting access for young readers.

meanwhile, the library system has completely removed dozens of titles that positively portray lgbtq people, including in adult sections of the library. as today’s court filing explains, the library system’s leadership has granted more than 50 requests from the greenville county republican women’s club to remove lgbtq materials, while disproportionately refusing other patrons’ requests to order new lgbtq materials.

plaintiffs in the lawsuit identify specific books that have been removed from the juvenile section. amber galea, parent of two children, says her children are interested in books that have been moved out of the juvenile section, including hocus and pocus and the spell for home by a.r. capetta, the cardboard kingdom by chad sell, riding freedom by pam muñoz ryan, and snapdragon by kat leyh.

the following are other examples of books that the library has moved out of juvenile and young adult sections:

julián is a mermaid by jessica love (an award-winning children’s picture book about a young boy who wishes to dress up like a mermaid)
ana on the edge by a.j. sass (an award-winning book about a 12-year-old nonbinary figure skater)
red: a crayon’s story by michael hall (a picture book about a blue crayon that was mistakenly labeled as “red”)
a list of 59 books that were removed entirely from the greenville county library system in 2023 is available here.

the complaint filed today can be found here.

the greenville county library board members who promoted anti-transgender collection policies in 2024 did not try to keep their discriminatory motives a secret. according to those board members’ public comments, library materials condoning gender fluidity are “trash” and the “idea” of “transgenderism” is a “dangerous thing.” as one library board member put it: “[t]he presence of a transgender character in a book … is grounds for relocating it to the adult section.”

meanwhile library board members and officials have ordered pride month displays to be taken down, ordered library staff to remove advertising for an lgbtq book club, and encouraged librarians to use the “weeding” process — meant to remove books that are outdated or in physical disrepair — as a pretext to throw out lgbtq titles, including books purchased within the past five years.

these actions by library board members and library administrators have contributed to an ongoing “culture of fear,” as highlighted in an october 2023 greenville news article. that cultural shift has led the staff turnover rate to double.

for years, local advocates and library employees have shown resilience in the face of these attacks. greenville county residents have shown up to speak against censorship at library board meetings. one library board member resigned in protest in july 2022 after the board chair ordered pride month displays to be taken down, and a former library communications director resigned in october 2022 after being pressured to remove a tv slide promoting an lgbtq book club.

today’s lawsuit seeks to address the practice of viewpoint discrimination in the greenville county library system, which reports 1.2 million visits per year across 12 locations. the plaintiffs are asking the court to uphold the freedom to access information, a right derived from the first amendment. they also ask the court to uphold the fourteenth amendment right to equal protection under the law for all greenville county residents.

first on the agenda was whether to move the book called “melissa,"" previously published as ""george."" by alex gino to the parenting and early childhood section. the book is a story about a transgender 10-year-old girl.

trustee james hoard made a motion to remove the book altogether.

""i think it's trash. we are a taxpayer-funded facility it's not the taxpayers' duty to subsidize trash,"" hoard said.

the motion failed but the board trustee continued to discuss whether to move the book.

some trustees felt the decision could lead to a slippery slope.

""we're going to have an endless string of book considerations or requests on both sides right,"" joe poore said.

ultimately, the board voted to move the book to the parenting and early childhood section and then moved on to discuss a new policy.

the policy brought by the library materials committee meeting would move any books that are for kids 12 years old or younger that deal with transgender themes to be located in the parenting and early childhood collection.

""these are books that will never be discovered. if you don't walk in the library already knowing this is a book you want then you will never find it,"" freedom in libraries advocacy group(flag) member susan ward said.

flag has been very outspoken against this issue and others involving the moving or removal of lgbtq materials at greenville county public libraries. ward believed the move would not only affect people who are a part of the lgbtq community but believes it creates further separation in the community as whole.

""if books about trans kids aren't available then it makes the families who don't know other families that have trans kids, it just increases that sense of otherness,"" ward said.

the board went on to unanimously approve the policy.

after reaching out to every member of the library board for comment, wyff heard back from two and one, dr. gene beckner provided the following statement.

""my hope is that moving forward that the greenville county library system continues to affirm that parents are the primary source of education for their children. parents have a fundamental right and responsibility to direct the upbringing and education of their children including issues of moral, social, physical, civic, and spiritual development.""

of the 12 greenville county library branches, only six have a parenting and early childhood section.

the case, moe v. yost, was originally filed on march 26 by the american civil liberties union, the aclu of ohio, and the global law firm goodwin on behalf of two families whose transgender adolescents would be negatively impacted by hb 68. on august 6, following a five-day trial in july, the franklin county court of common pleas rejected the plaintiffs’ challenge, and allowed the ban to take effect. today, transgender youth in ohio will once again be able to access lifesaving healthcare.

the following is reaction to the ruling:

freda levenson, legal director at the aclu of ohio:

“today, we celebrate this win not only for our brave plaintiffs, but for all lgbtq+ ohioans and their families. this win restores the right of trans youth in ohio to choose vitally important health care, with the support of their families and physicians. we are gratified by the court’s decision, which soundly rejects this interference of politicians with ohioans’ bodily autonomy. although this litigation will likely not end here, we remain fervently committed to preventing this egregious bill from ever again taking effect. the path towards protecting the rights and civil liberties of trans ohioans goes on, and we will continue to hold the torch.”

harper seldin, senior staff attorney, american civil liberties union:
“this is a critical victory for transgender youth and their families across ohio. the state’s ban is discriminatory, baseless, and a danger to the well-being of the same ohioan youth lawmakers claim to want to protect. it’s also part of a sweeping effort to drive trans people out of public life altogether by controlling our health care, our families, and our lives. we’re thankful the court upheld their rights under the state constitution.”

miranda hooker, complex litigation & dispute resolution partner, goodwin:

""we applaud the families who courageously shared their personal experiences to oppose house bill 68. this victory underscores the critical need to safeguard bodily autonomy and access to essential healthcare. the decision marks an important milestone in advancing equality and personal freedom for all ohioans and we will continue to fight against the unconstitutional bill moving forward.""","['today', 'historic', 'win', 'bodily', 'autonomy', 'ohioan', 'judge', 'panel', 'tenth', 'district', 'court', 'appeals', 'overturned', 'house', 'bill', 'ohio', 'law', 'ban', 'gender', 'affirm', 'medical', 'care', 'trans', 'youth', 'prohibit', 'tran', 'woman', 'girl', 'participate', 'sport', 'case', 'moe', 'yost', 'originally', 'file', 'march', 'american', 'civil', 'liberty', 'union', 'aclu', 'ohio', 'global', 'law', 'firm', 'goodwin', 'behalf', 'family', 'transgender', 'adolescent', 'negatively', 'impact', 'hb', 'august', 'follow', 'day', 'trial', 'july', 'franklin', 'county', 'court', 'common', 'plea', 'reject', 'plaintiff', 'challenge', 'allow', 'ban', 'effect', 'today', 'transgender', 'youth', 'ohio', 'able', 'access', 'lifesave', 'healthcare', 'following', 'reaction', 'ruling', 'freda', 'levenson', 'legal', 'director', 'aclu', 'ohio', 'today', 'celebrate', 'win', 'brave', 'plaintiff', 'ohioan', 'family', 'win', 'restore', 'right', 'trans', 'youth', 'ohio', 'choose', 'vitally', 'important', 'health', 'care', 'support', 'family', 'physician', 'gratify', 'court', 'decision', 'soundly', 'reject', 'interference', 'politician', 'ohioan', 'bodily', 'autonomy', 'litigation', 'likely', 'end', 'remain', 'fervently', 'commit', 'prevent', 'egregious', 'bill', 'take', 'effect', 'path', 'protect', 'right', 'civil', 'liberty', 'trans', 'ohioans', 'go', 'continue', 'hold', 'torch', 'harper', 'seldin', 'senior', 'staff', 'attorney', 'american', 'civil', 'liberty', 'union', 'critical', 'victory', 'transgender', 'youth', 'family', 'ohio', 'state', 'ban', 'discriminatory', 'baseless', 'danger', 'ohioan', 'youth', 'lawmaker', 'claim', 'want', 'protect', 'sweeping', 'effort', 'drive', 'tran', 'people', 'public', 'life', 'altogether', 'control', 'health', 'care', 'family', 'life', 'thankful', 'court', 'uphold', 'right', 'state', 'constitution', 'miranda', 'hooker', 'complex', 'litigation', 'dispute', 'resolution', 'partner', 'goodwin', 'applaud', 'family', 'courageously', 'share', 'personal', 'experience', 'oppose', 'house', 'bill', 'victory', 'underscore', 'critical', 'need', 'safeguard', 'bodily', 'autonomy', 'access', 'essential', 'healthcare', 'decision', 'mark', 'important', 'milestone', 'advance', 'equality', 'personal', 'freedom', 'ohioan', 'continue', 'fight', 'unconstitutional', 'bill', 'move', 'forward']",

the ruling comes after a franklin county judge refused in august to permanently block house bill 68, which banned transgender-affirming care for minors and boys competing in girls sports.

ohio attorney general dave yost promised to appeal.

“this is a no-brainer – we are appealing that decision and will seek an immediate stay,” yost said. “there is no way i’ll stop fighting to protect these unprotected children. ohio’s elected representatives properly passed legislation protecting children from irreversible chemical sex change procedures, and the trial court upheld the law. but now the 10th district court of appeals has just greenlighted these permanent medical interventions against minors.” a three-judge panel on the 10th district court of appeals blocked the law.

“today, we celebrate this win not only for our brave plaintiffs but for all lgbtq+ ohioans and their families,” aclu-ohio legal director freda levenson said in a statement. “this win restores the right of trans youth in ohio to choose vitally important health care, with the support of their families and physicians. we are gratified by the court’s decision, which soundly rejects this interference of politicians with ohioans’ bodily autonomy. although this litigation will likely not end here, we remain fervently committed to preventing this egregious bill from ever again taking effect. the path towards protecting the rights and civil liberties of trans ohioans goes on, and we will continue to hold the torch.”

the aclu sued in march 2024 on behalf of two families in franklin county to stop the once-vetoed bill from taking effect in late april of that year. the lawsuit said the bill violates the ohio constitution’s single subject, the health care provision, the equal protection clause, and the due course of law provision.

the legislation blocks gender-affirming care for minors, including surgeries, puberty blockers, and hormone therapy.

in december 2023, gov. mike dewine vetoed the bill and a week later issued an executive order that banned gender-affirming surgeries on minors and developed corresponding health care rules for children and adults.

the republican-majority senate easily voted to override the veto in late january. the house, also majority republican, did the same earlier in the month.

the aclu calls gender-affirming care lifesaving health care supported by major medical associations nationwide, including the american medical association, the american academy of pediatrics and the american psychological association.","['appeal', 'court', 'tuesday', 'stop', 'ohio', 'ban', 'gender', 'affirm', 'care', 'minor', 'ruling', 'come', 'franklin', 'county', 'judge', 'refuse', 'august', 'permanently', 'block', 'house', 'bill', 'ban', 'transgender', 'affirm', 'care', 'minor', 'boy', 'compete', 'girl', 'sport', 'ohio', 'attorney', 'general', 'dave', 'yost', 'promise', 'appeal', 'brainer', 'appeal', 'decision', 'seek', 'immediate', 'stay', 'yost', 'say', 'way', 'stop', 'fight', 'protect', 'unprotected', 'child', 'ohio', 'elect', 'representative', 'properly', 'pass', 'legislation', 'protect', 'child', 'irreversible', 'chemical', 'sex', 'change', 'procedure', 'trial', 'court', 'uphold', 'law', 'district', 'court', 'appeals', 'greenlighte', 'permanent', 'medical', 'intervention', 'minor', 'judge', 'panel', 'district', 'court', 'appeal', 'block', 'law', 'today', 'celebrate', 'win', 'brave', 'plaintiff', 'ohioan', 'family', 'aclu', 'ohio', 'legal', 'director', 'freda', 'levenson', 'say', 'statement', 'win', 'restore', 'right', 'trans', 'youth', 'ohio', 'choose', 'vitally', 'important', 'health', 'care', 'support', 'family', 'physician', 'gratify', 'court', 'decision', 'soundly', 'reject', 'interference', 'politician', 'ohioan', 'bodily', 'autonomy', 'litigation', 'likely', 'end', 'remain', 'fervently', 'commit', 'prevent', 'egregious', 'bill', 'take', 'effect', 'path', 'protect', 'right', 'civil', 'liberty', 'trans', 'ohioans', 'go', 'continue', 'hold', 'torch', 'aclu', 'sue', 'march', 'behalf', 'family', 'franklin', 'county', 'stop', 'veto', 'bill', 'take', 'effect', 'late', 'april', 'year', 'lawsuit', 'say', 'bill', 'violate', 'ohio', 'constitution', 'single', 'subject', 'health', 'care', 'provision', 'equal', 'protection', 'clause', 'course', 'law', 'provision', 'legislation', 'block', 'gender', 'affirm', 'care', 'minor', 'include', 'surgery', 'puberty', 'blocker', 'hormone', 'therapy', 'december', 'gov', 'mike', 'dewine', 'veto', 'bill', 'week', 'later', 'issue', 'executive', 'order', 'ban', 'gender', 'affirm', 'surgery', 'minor', 'develop', 'corresponding', 'health', 'care', 'rule', 'child', 'adult', 'republican', 'majority', 'senate', 'easily', 'vote', 'override', 'veto', 'late', 'january', 'house', 'majority', 'republican', 'early', 'month', 'aclu', 'call', 'gender', 'affirm', 'care', 'lifesave', 'health', 'care', 'support', 'major', 'medical', 'association', 'nationwide', 'include', 'american', 'medical', 'association', 'american', 'academy', 'pediatric', 'american', 'psychological', 'association']",

in july 2023, the sixth circuit court of appeals rejected requests from families and medical providers to block laws in tennessee and kentucky banning gender-affirming medical care for transgender youth. at the same time, the court elected to combine the requests, linking plaintiffs like a nashville-based couple and their transgender teenage daughter, and a medical provider who supports trans youth  with families in kentucky. both states asked the united states supreme court to rule on whether these laws are unconstitutional. this year, the supreme court agreed to hear the case, now listed as u.s. v. skrmetti. the plaintiffs in the tennessee case are represented by the american civil liberties union, the aclu of tennessee, lambda legal, and akin gump. our legal challenge is limited to the provisions of tennessee’s ban targeting hormone therapies — such as hormone replacement therapy and puberty blockers — and does not implicate surgical care. to understand what’s at stake, the aclu breaks down the case and who it impacts. we also share what we can all do to protect gender-affirming care and support trans rights.

how could u.s. v. skrmetti. impact trans health care?
the question in this case is whether tennessee’s law banning gender-affirming hormone therapies for transgender minors violates the equal protection clause of the us constitution. tennessee’s ban, like every other passed by politicians in recent years, specifically permits these same hormone medications when they are provided in a way that tennessee considers “consistent” with a person’s sex designated at birth. this means, for example, a doctor could prescribe estrogen to a cisgender teenage girl for any clinical diagnosis but could not do the same for a transgender girl diagnosed with gender dysphoria.

the aclu argues that tennessee’s ban is a clear example of discrimination on the basis of sex and transgender status making it a violation of the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment of the constitution. we made a similar argument in 2020 when, alongside other legal advocates, we successfully argued in front of the supreme court on behalf of lgbtq clients fired because of their sexual orientation and gender identity, including a transgender woman fired from her job at a michigan funeral home. in a 6-3 ruling, the supreme court ruled in favor of lgbtq workers and found “it is impossible to discriminate against a person for being homosexual or transgender without discriminating against that individual based on sex” and therefore discrimination against lgbtq workers was impermissible sex discrimination under title vii, the federal law prohibiting sex discrimination in employment.

in recent years, district courts unanimously blocked bans in arkansas, alabama, florida, georgia, indiana, kentucky, and tennessee, but the sixth, seventh, and eleventh circuit courts of appeals have allowed these bans to take effect. the supreme court must now decide whether states can ban medical treatment for transgender youth with gender dysphoria, but not whether they must. if the court finds tennessee’s law constitutional, the immediate impact on access to these treatments will be limited to the two states where the bans are already in effect.

how does this case impact other health care, like birth control?
when arguing against transgender people and their families, states with bans like tennessee’s have relied heavily on the supreme court’s opinion dobbs v. jackson women’s health organization, which overturned roe v. wade and allowed states to ban abortion. u.s. v. skrmetti will be a major test of how far the court is willing to stretch dobbs to allow states to ban other health care. the court’s ruling could serve as a stepping stone towards further limiting access to abortion, ivf, and birth control.","['state', 'ban', 'hormone', 'therapy', 'transgender', 'youth', 'gender', 'dysphoria', 'lead', 'medical', 'expert', 'organization', 'american', 'medical', 'association', 'american', 'psychiatric', 'association', 'american', 'academy', 'pediatric', 'oppose', 'restriction', 'force', 'thousand', 'family', 'country', 'travel', 'maintain', 'access', 'medical', 'care', 'watch', 'child', 'suffer', 'july', 'sixth', 'circuit', 'court', 'appeals', 'reject', 'request', 'family', 'medical', 'provider', 'block', 'law', 'tennessee', 'kentucky', 'ban', 'gender', 'affirm', 'medical', 'care', 'transgender', 'youth', 'time', 'court', 'elect', 'combine', 'request', 'link', 'plaintiff', 'like', 'nashville', 'base', 'couple', 'transgender', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'medical', 'provider', 'support', 'trans', 'youth', 'family', 'kentucky', 'state', 'ask', 'united', 'states', 'supreme', 'court', 'rule', 'law', 'unconstitutional', 'year', 'supreme', 'court', 'agree', 'hear', 'case', 'list', 'skrmetti', 'plaintiff', 'tennessee', 'case', 'represent', 'american', 'civil', 'liberty', 'union', 'aclu', 'tennessee', 'lambda', 'legal', 'akin', 'gump', 'legal', 'challenge', 'limit', 'provision', 'tennessee', 'ban', 'target', 'hormone', 'therapy', 'hormone', 'replacement', 'therapy', 'puberty', 'blocker', 'implicate', 'surgical', 'care', 'understand', 'stake', 'aclu', 'break', 'case', 'impact', 'share', 'protect', 'gender', 'affirm', 'care', 'support', 'tran', 'right', 'skrmetti', 'impact', 'trans', 'health', 'care', 'question', 'case', 'tennessee', 'law', 'ban', 'gender', 'affirm', 'hormone', 'therapy', 'transgender', 'minor', 'violate', 'equal', 'protection', 'clause', 'constitution', 'tennessee', 'ban', 'like', 'pass', 'politician', 'recent', 'year', 'specifically', 'permit', 'hormone', 'medication', 'provide', 'way', 'tennessee', 'consider', 'consistent', 'person', 'sex', 'designate', 'birth', 'mean', 'example', 'doctor', 'prescribe', 'estrogen', 'cisgender', 'teenage', 'girl', 'clinical', 'diagnosis', 'transgend', 'girl', 'diagnose', 'gender', 'dysphoria', 'aclu', 'argue', 'tennessee', 'ban', 'clear', 'example', 'discrimination', 'basis', 'sex', 'transgender', 'status', 'make', 'violation', 'equal', 'protection', 'clause', 'amendment', 'constitution', 'similar', 'argument', 'alongside', 'legal', 'advocate', 'successfully', 'argue', 'supreme', 'court', 'behalf', 'lgbtq', 'client', 'fire', 'sexual', 'orientation', 'gender', 'identity', 'include', 'transgender', 'woman', 'fire', 'job', 'michigan', 'funeral', 'home', 'ruling', 'supreme', 'court', 'rule', 'favor', 'lgbtq', 'worker', 'find', 'impossible', 'discriminate', 'person', 'homosexual', 'transgender', 'discriminate', 'individual', 'base', 'sex', 'discrimination', 'lgbtq', 'worker', 'impermissible', 'sex', 'discrimination', 'title', 'vii', 'federal', 'law', 'prohibit', 'sex', 'discrimination', 'employment', 'recent', 'year', 'district', 'court', 'unanimously', 'block', 'ban', 'arkansas', 'alabama', 'florida', 'georgia', 'indiana', 'kentucky', 'tennessee', 'sixth', 'seventh', 'eleventh', 'circuit', 'court', 'appeal', 'allow', 'ban', 'effect', 'supreme', 'court', 'decide', 'state', 'ban', 'medical', 'treatment', 'transgender', 'youth', 'gender', 'dysphoria', 'court', 'find', 'tennessee', 'law', 'constitutional', 'immediate', 'impact', 'access', 'treatment', 'limit', 'state', 'ban', 'effect', 'case', 'impact', 'health', 'care', 'like', 'birth', 'control', 'argue', 'transgender', 'people', 'family', 'state', 'ban', 'like', 'tennessee', 'rely', 'heavily', 'supreme', 'court', 'opinion', 'dobbs', 'jackson', 'women', 'health', 'organization', 'overturn', 'roe', 'wade', 'allow', 'state', 'ban', 'abortion', 'skrmetti', 'major', 'test', 'far', 'court', 'willing', 'stretch', 'dobbs', 'allow', 'state', 'ban', 'health', 'care', 'court', 'ruling', 'serve', 'stepping', 'stone', 'limit', 'access', 'abortion', 'ivf', 'birth', 'control']",

with protesters chanting outside, the court heard arguments for two-and-a-half hours from attorneys for the state of tennessee, the department of justice, and the aclu in a challenge to the constitutionality of tennessee’s ban on “gender-affirming” care for minors.

in u.s. v. skrmetti, the biden justice department and the aclu argued that the state law violates the equal protection clause of the constitution’s 14th amendment because it discriminates based on sex. to the contrary, the state of tennessee and its attorney general, jonathan skrmetti, say the law restricts conduct based only on age (for those children under the age of 18) and how certain drugs are used (for so-called gender-affirming care). legal challenges to these types of laws are typically brought by parents who seek drugs, such as puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones, and surgical intervention for their children who profess to identify with the opposite sex. they argue that laws like tennessee’s violate two parts of the 14th amendment—the due process clause, by depriving parents of the right to make medical decisions for their children, and the equal protection clause, by discriminating against their children based on sex.

president joe biden’s administration, rather than parents, brought this challenge, and the u.s. court of appeals for the 6th circuit rejected both arguments. last year, the 8th circuit struck down a similar arkansas law, but only on equal protection grounds.
the supreme court, therefore, is addressing only that argument, because that is the one on which the 6th and 8th circuits disagreed. during the argument, however, justice amy coney barrett clarified that upholding the tennessee statute on equal protection grounds would not prevent parents from pursuing their claim that such laws violate the due process clause.

‘main issue on the table’
the heart of the challengers’ case is that the tennessee statute treats people differently based on sex. justice ketanji brown jackson agreed that this is the “main issue on the table.” the kind of classification of a law is important to determining the appropriate standard of review, which in turn determines how easy or difficult it is to defend that law against a challenge under the equal protection clause.

most laws that make distinctions as to when they will or will not apply do not do so on the basis of a “suspect class.” such laws are subject to rational basis review and are constitutional if they are a “rational” way of addressing a “legitimate” legislative purpose—a relatively easy standard to meet.

if a law makes distinctions by classifying people based on a “sex,” it is subject to heightened or “intermediate scrutiny” review. such laws will be upheld only if they are “substantially related” to achieving an “important” government purpose.

as tennessee persuasively argues, rather than classifying based on sex, the law classifies on based on purpose. in other words, it distinguishes based on minors seeking drugs for gender transition and minors seeking drugs for any other medical purposes. the supreme court has never recognized restrictions on the use of drugs for a particular medical purpose to demand heightened scrutiny review, so rational-basis review applies.

that standard, the state of tennessee easily satisfies, and the 6th circuit agreed. ‘a sex-based classification’?
but the challengers want to label the law a sex-based classification to make it harder for tennessee to defend.

arguing for the biden administration, u.s. solicitor general elizabeth prelogar asked the court simply to put the tennessee statute in that category and send the case back to the lower courts to apply the “intermediate scrutiny” review test. but justice brett kavanaugh observed that, if it did, the case would soon be right back in the supreme court’s lap.

prelogar insisted that the tennessee statute is obviously based on sex, but her argument is inconsistent with the text of the statute itself. she argued that the law would allow a boy to obtain puberty-blockers to delay experiencing a normal male puberty, but a girl could not. but the statute only says that a minor may not obtain such drugs for the purposes of identifying with a different sex—and that prohibition applies equally to both boys and to girls.

despite prelogar’s insistence, the law only restricts access to the drugs based on age and on the medical use of the drugs.

kavanaugh, chief justice john roberts, and justice samuel alito expressed hesitancy about involving themselves in issues that are better left to state legislatures to decide.

‘leave the issue to the legislatures’?
roberts argued that the court was “not [in] the best situation to make determinations about medical considerations. doesn’t that make the case for us to leave the issue to the legislatures?” he also alluded to the court’s landmark ruling in dobbs v. jackson women’s health organization in june 2022, which overturned roe v. wade, saying that the current case was really about “constitutional allocations of authority.” in an almost verbatim recitation from the dobbs majority opinion, he continued: “perhaps we should leave this issue to the people and their elected representatives.”

roberts and kavanaugh also stressed the shaky scientific footing of gender “medicine,” and cited various european reports, saying that “countries who have been at the forefront [are now] pumping the brakes on this,” something that kavanaugh noted gave the court “a yellow light, if not a red light” in moving forward into “constitutionalizing” a new area of law.

but it was perhaps the line of questioning from alito that was the most intense of the morning. alito, too, cited specific studies from sweden and england, including the bombshell cass report, which indicated that gender medicine is largely unproven and presents significant health risks to children.

he chided prelogar, saying that she had “relegated [it] to a footnote.”

in their briefs, both the government and the aclu asserted a different basis on which the court could provide relief.

if the justices didn’t think the law discriminated based on sex, they could find that the law discriminated on the basis of transgender status, and that, too, they argued, would require that the law be subject to intermediate scrutiny review. this alternative argument also took center stage in wednesday’s argument. a majority of the justices, however, did not seem to buy it.

both barrett and alito pointed out that the court had turned down other requests to expand constitutionally protected categories, such as age and mental disability. their line of demarcation in equal protection clause cases had always been immutable characteristics—those derived by accident of birth, such as race, sex, and national origin.

so, when transgender lawyer chase strangio took the podium for the aclu, alito continued his grilling, asking pointedly “is transgender status immutable?” when strangio responded that it would indeed “satisfy an immutability test,” alito peppered the aclu lawyer with various hypotheticals: what about people who are “gender-fluid,” or who change gender identities over time, or who are “nonbinary”?

‘an immutable characteristic’?
when strangio floundered, alito retorted, “so, transgender status is not an immutable characteristic, is it?”

unsurprisingly, the more liberal members of the court, jackson and justices sonia sotomayor and elena kagan, appeared more favorable to prelogar’s and strangio’s arguments. jackson likened the current case to loving v. virginia, the court’s landmark civil rights decision that determined that laws banning interracial marriage violated the equal protection and due process clauses of the 14th amendment.

in arguing that the state had once legislated in such a way based on racial classifications, and that the court had overridden those state legislative judgments based on the constitution’s promise of equality, jackson argued it should do the same here.  twenty-six states have passed laws similar to tennessee’s in the past few years, and some of them have been challenged in the courts. but u.s. v. skrmetti is the first case of its kind to reach the supreme court.

the court’s decision, which likely won’t be issued till june, no doubt will have a significant impact on the legislative and litigation efforts on this controversial issue for years to come.","['supreme', 'court', 'case', 'slate', 'oral', 'argument', 'wednesday', 'morning', 'doozy', 'protester', 'chant', 'outside', 'court', 'hear', 'argument', 'half', 'hour', 'attorney', 'state',

after a prior restriction on amendments of birth certificates was struck down by the courts, in early 2024 the state of montana enacted a new rule that categorically bars transgender montanans from correcting the sex designation on their birth certificates. around the same time, the montana department of justice adopted a policy similarly restricting amendment of driver’s licenses. the plaintiffs challenged these policies in state district court, arguing that they violate various constitutional provisions, including the right to equal protection of the law.

in a recent montana supreme court decision, two justices concluded that discrimination on the basis of transgender status – as the state is engaging in here – is a form of sex discrimination that violates the montana constitution’s equal protection clause.

the plaintiffs, two transgender women, are represented by the american civil liberties union, the aclu of montana, and nixon peabody llp.

plaintiff jessica kalarchik, a veteran who served in the united states army for 31 years, said: “after finally being able to live my life openly as the woman i know myself to be, i am frustrated that my birth state, montana, wants me to carry around a birth certificate that incorrectly lists my sex as male. i live my life openly as a woman, i am treated as a woman in my daily life, and there is no reason i should be forced to carry a birth certificate that incorrectly identifies me as male. fortunately, the court agrees that this ridiculous policy should not be in effect.”

“once again the state of montana chose to adopt a draconian policy that is clearly intended to marginalize transgender montanans, only for that discriminatory action to be blocked by the courts,” said akilah deernose, executive director for the aclu of montana. “here in montana we treasure our right to privacy and to live our lives free from governmental intrusion. the state of montana clearly has not learned any lessons from the past few years, where courts have repeatedly struck down unconstitutional laws targeting transgender montanans.”

“forcing anyone to carry documents that contradict their identity unjustly violates their rights to privacy, equal treatment, and not being compelled to convey a government message about their sex that they disagree with,” said malita picasso, staff attorney for the aclu’s lgbtq & hiv project. “such a policy marks transgender people for further mistreatment and discrimination, essentially requiring them to carry papers that out them as transgender any time they need to provide identity documents. fortunately, the court has refused to allow the state of montana to subvert the freedom of transgender montanans to control their own identity as this case goes forward.”

in granting the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction, the court held, “[i]f the challenged state actions discriminate against transgender individuals on the basis of their transgender status, they also necessarily discriminate the basis of sex.”

the state has the option of appealing the district court’s ruling to the montana supreme court, but the underlying case will proceed in district court. a trial has not yet been scheduled.","['montana', 'court', 'grant', 'preliminary', 'injunction', 'prevent', 'state', 'montana', 'enforce', 'policy', 'bar', 'transgender', 'people', 'obtain', 'accurate', 'sex', 'designation', 'birth', 'certificate', 'driver', 'license', 'prior', 'restriction', 'amendment', 'birth', 'certificate', 'strike', 'court', 'early', 'state', 'montana', 'enact', 'new', 'rule', 'categorically', 'bar', 'transgend', 'montanan', 'correct', 'sex', 'designation', 'birth', 'certificate', 'time', 'montana', 'department', 'justice', 'adopt', 'policy', 'similarly', 'restrict', 'amendment', 'driver', 'license', 'plaintiff', 'challenge', 'policy', 'state', 'district', 'court', 'argue', 'violate', 'constitutional', 'provision', 'include', 'right', 'equal', 'protection', 'law', 'recent', 'montana', 'supreme', 'court', 'decision', 'justice', 'conclude', 'discrimination', 'basis', 'transgender', 'status', 'state', 'engage', 'form', 'sex', 'discrimination', 'violate', 'montana', 'constitution', 'equal', 'protection', 'clause', 'plaintiff', 'transgender', 'woman', 'represent', 'american', 'civil', 'liberty', 'union', 'aclu', 'montana', 'nixon', 'peabody', 'llp', 'plaintiff', 'jessica', 'kalarchik', 'veteran', 'serve', 'united', 'states', 'army', 'year', 'say', 'finally', 'able', 'live', 'life', 'openly', 'woman', 'know', 'frustrated', 'birth', 'state', 'montana', 'want', 'carry', 'birth', 'certificate', 'incorrectly', 'list', 'sex', 'male', 'live', 'life', 'openly', 'woman', 'treat', 'woman', 'daily', 'life', 'reason', 'force', 'carry', 'birth', 'certificate', 'incorrectly', 'identify', 'male', 'fortunately', 'court', 'agree', 'ridiculous', 'policy', 'effect', 'state', 'montana', 'choose', 'adopt', 'draconian', 'policy', 'clearly', 'intend', 'marginalize', 'transgender', 'montanans', 'discriminatory', 'action', 'block', 'court', 'say', 'akilah', 'deernose', 'executive', 'director', 'aclu', 'montana', 'montana', 'treasure', 'right', 'privacy', 'live', 'life', 'free', 'governmental', 'intrusion', 'state', 'montana', 'clearly', 'learn', 'lesson', 'past', 'year', 'court', 'repeatedly', 'strike', 'unconstitutional', 'law', 'target', 'transgender', 'montanans', 'force', 'carry', 'document', 'contradict', 'identity', 'unjustly', 'violate', 'right', 'privacy', 'equal', 'treatment', 'compel', 'convey', 'government', 'message', 'sex', 'disagree', 'say', 'malita', 'picasso', 'staff', 'attorney', 'aclu', 'lgbtq', 'hiv', 'project', 'policy', 'mark', 'transgend', 'people', 'mistreatment', 'discrimination', 'essentially', 'require', 'carry', 'paper', 'transgender', 'time', 'need', 'provide', 'identity', 'document', 'fortunately', 'court', 'refuse', 'allow', 'state', 'montana', 'subvert', 'freedom', 'transgender', 'montanan', 'control', 'identity', 'case', 'go', 'forward', 'grant', 'plaintiff', 'motion', 'preliminary', 'injunction', 'court', 'hold', 'challenge', 'state', 'action', 'discriminate', 'transgender', 'individual', 'basis', 'transgender', 'status', 'necessarily', 'discriminate', 'basis', 'sex', 'state', 'option', 'appeal', 'district', 'court', 'ruling', 'montana', 'supreme', 'court', 'underlying', 'case', 'proceed', 'district', 'court', 'trial', 'schedule']",

district judge mike menahan on monday ruled that the ban would be blocked while the case proceeds through the courts.

chase scheuer, press secretary for the attorney general's office in montana, told fox news digital in a statement on wednesday that the office is reviewing the judge's order to determine what steps to take next. ""the judiciary has once again defied the democratic will of montanans by siding with special interest groups and radical leftist ideology,"" scheuer said. under state law, transgender people born in montana are blocked from changing the sex designation on their birth certificate, and transgender residents are prevented from changing the sex on their driver’s licenses without an amended birth certificate.

two transgender women filed the case in april on behalf of themselves and others who have been unable to obtain documents ""that accurately reflect their sex,"" the complaint said. the state had argued that sex is binary, either male or female, and that being transgender is not a protected class of people who could have their constitutional rights to privacy violated.

menahan said it was not necessary at this point in the litigation to determine whether transgender montanans constitute a special class on the basis of their transgender status, and disagreed with the state’s argument that discrimination on the basis of transgender status is not discrimination on the basis of sex. ""if the challenged state actions discriminate against transgender individuals on the basis of their transgender status, they also necessarily discriminate on the basis of sex,"" he wrote. the ruling comes days after the montana supreme court temporarily blocked a state law banning transgender surgeries for minors, saying the law likely violates montana’s constitutional right to privacy.","['rule', 'ban', 'transgend', 'people', 'montana', 'change', 'sex', 'designation', 'birth', 'certificate', 'driver', 'license', 'temporarily', 'block', 'follow', 'state', 'judge', 'ruling', 'district', 'judge', 'mike', 'menahan', 'monday', 'rule', 'ban', 'block', 'case', 'proceed', 'court', 'chase', 'scheuer', 'press', 'secretary', 'attorney', 'general', 'office', 'montana', 'tell', 'fox', 'news', 'digital', 'statement', 'wednesday', 'office', 'review', 'judge', 'order', 'determine', 'step', 'judiciary', 'defy', 'democratic', 'montanan', 'side', 'special', 'interest', 'group', 'radical', 'leftist', 'ideology', 'scheuer', 'say', 'state', 'law', 'transgender', 'people', 'bear', 'montana', 'block', 'change', 'sex', 'designation', 'birth', 'certificate', 'transgender', 'resident', 'prevent', 'change', 'sex', 'driver', 'license', 'amend', 'birth', 'certificate', 'transgender', 'woman', 'file', 'case', 'april', 'behalf', 'unable', 'obtain', 'document', 'accurately', 'reflect', 'sex', 'complaint', 'say', 'state', 'argue', 'sex', 'binary', 'male', 'female', 'transgender', 'protect', 'class', 'people', 'constitutional', 'right', 'privacy', 'violate', 'menahan', 'say', 'necessary', 'point', 'litigation', 'determine', 'transgender', 'montanans', 'constitute', 'special', 'class', 'basis', 'transgender', 'status', 'disagree', 'state', 'argument', 'discrimination', 'basis', 'transgender', 'status', 'discrimination', 'basis', 'sex', 'challenge', 'state', 'action', 'discriminate', 'transgender', 'individual', 'basis', 'transgender', 'status', 'necessarily', 'discriminate', 'basis', 'sex', 'write', 'ruling', 'come', 'day', 'montana', 'supreme', 'court', 'temporarily', 'block', 'state', 'law', 'ban', 'transgender', 'surgery', 'minor', 'say', 'law', 'likely', 'violate', 'montana', 'constitutional', 'right', 'privacy']",

the effects of having an inaccurate birth certificate can be life-altering. for starters, an incorrect birth certificate can disclose the fact that a person is transgender without their consent. additionally, employers, healthcare workers, government employees and officials, and others may harass and discriminate against transgender people whose identification documents do not align with their gender.

the aclu, the aclu of montana, and nixon peabody llp have challenged sb 280 in court, because it violates transgender montanans’ right to equal protection, privacy, and due process.

update: on june 26, 2023, the trial court granted summary judgment in our favor and permanently enjoined enforcement of the montana law and regulation barring a change of the sex marker on one’s birth certificate without obtaining a court order that one has been surgically changed as unconstitutionally vague under the montana constitution. the trial court also granted us attorneys’ fees for all our work in the case. it also held defendants in contempt for failing to comply with the preliminary injunction previously granted in the case.","['senate', 'bill', 'make', 'difficult', 'impossible', 'transgender', 'people', 'bear', 'montana', 'correct', 'sex', 'marker', 'list', 'birth', 'certificate', 'law', 'require', 'transgend', 'person', 'obtain', 'court', 'order', 'indicate', 'sex', 'change', 'surgical', 'procedure', 'surgery', 'change', 'anatomy', 'sex', 'surgery', 'unwanted', 'unnecessary', 'cost', 'prohibitive', 'transgender', 'individual', 'bear', 'montana', 'passage', 'sb', 'transgender', 'individual', 'bear', 'montana', 'need', 'provide', 'affidavit', 'attesting', 'sex', 'change', 'sex', 'marker', 'birth', 'certificate', 'montana', 'legislature', 'end', 'straightforward', 'process', 'work', 'effectively', 'incident', 'sb', 'burden', 'transgender', 'montanans', 'ability', 'obtain', 'accurate', 'birth', 'certificate', 'solely', 'transgender', 'effect', 'have', 'inaccurate', 'birth', 'certificate', 'life', 'altering', 'starter', 'incorrect', 'birth', 'certificate', 'disclose', 'fact', 'person', 'transgend', 'consent', 'additionally', 'employer', 'healthcare', 'worker', 'government', 'employee', 'official', 'harass', 'discriminate', 'transgender', 'people', 'identification', 'document', 'align', 'gender', 'aclu', 'aclu', 'montana', 'nixon', 'peabody', 'llp', 'challenge', 'sb', 'court', 'violate', 'transgender', 'montanans', 'right', 'equal', 'protection', 'privacy', 'process', 'update', 'june', 'trial', 'court', 'grant', 'summary', 'judgment', 'favor', 'permanently', 'enjoin', 'enforcement', 'montana', 'law', 'regulation', 'bar', 'change', 'sex', 'marker', 'birth', 'certificate', 'obtain', 'court', 'order', 'surgically', 'change', 'unconstitutionally', 'vague', 'montana', 'constitution', 'trial', 'court', 'grant', 'attorney', 'fee', 'work', 'case', 'hold', 'defendant', 'contempt', 'fail', 'comply', 'preliminary', 'injunction', 'previously', 'grant', 'case']",

mahmoud v. taylor is about a small number of lgbtq-inclusive children’s books included in the classrooms of montgomery county (maryland) public schools. the books were chosen and evaluated by education professionals. six parents (three couples) sued the school district board of education claiming their religious freedom was violated by not having an option to opt out their children from classrooms where the books might be part of curriculum, including when offered as nonmandatory supplemental learning materials.

context to know and report:

in 2022, montgomery county public schools (mcps) in maryland expanded their curriculum book collection with nine inclusive picture books for children. an mcps committee selected the titles and completed the necessary evaluation forms, which were then reviewed by a content supervisor, according to district protocol. 
the school board stated in legal filings, “the books are made available for individual reading, classroom read-alouds, and other educational activities designed to foster and enhance literacy skills.
a district official said the books were to be integrated “into the curriculum in the same way that other books are used, namely, to put them on a shelf for students to find on their own; to recommend a book to a student who would enjoy it; to offer the books as an option for literature circles, book clubs, or paired reading groups; or to use them as a read aloud.”
the district’s communications director, jessica baxter, said the books tell “joyful stories of folks who happen to be part of the lgbtq+ community,” and that they “celebrate and positively portray lgbtq+ identities.” 
three couples filed a lawsuit against mcps in 2023, objecting to the books and claiming the district infringed on their religious rights by not allowing them to opt out their children from potential exposure to the books.
the plaintiffs are represented by becket, formerly known as becket fund for religious liberty, a legal group with an anti-lgbtq history that includes representing a school that fired a 15-year veteran teacher for being gay and marrying her partner of 25 years. southern poverty law center describes becket as a “hardline” group that promotes legislation and lawsuits to justify anti-gay discrimination. becket has also vigorously pursued banning access to abortion and access to contraception.
people of faith support lgbtq people and equality, and lgbtq people are also people of faith. 67% of adult americans say being lgbtq should be accepted by society, including 59% of religiously-affiliated adults. 
two-thirds of u.s. catholics, protestants and other christians oppose using religious beliefs as an excuse to discriminate against lgbtq people.
ucla’s williams institute: 2.6 million lgbtq adults are raising children under age 18.
24% of all lgbtq parents live in the northeast u.s., which encompasses maryland. 31% live in the u.s. south. approximately 5 million children in the u.s. are being raised by an lgbtq parent. 20% of lgbtq people in maryland are raising children.

pen america has documented more than 16,000 book bans in public schools nationwide since 2021, predominantly targeting books by and about lgbtq people and books about people of color and race and racism. in its latest report cover to cover in february, the organization found 29% of all banned titles during the 2023-2024 school year featured lgbtq+ characters, people, or themes.
pen america has tracked tactics used to ban books across the country. religious freedom arguments are the latest way to try to get books, especially with lgbtq themes and characters, banned. mahmoud v. taylor has the potential to dramatically escalate book bans across the country by giving legal cover to discriminatory censorship, particularly targeting lgbtq narratives.
the american library association (ala) tracked 414 book ban attempts against public school and library materials, encompassing 1,128 unique titles, in the first eight months of 2024. 
the u.s. supreme court agreed to hear the plaintiffs’ appeal after their requests to force the school district to provide opt outs while the case was being litigated lost in both the lower federal trial and appellate court. federal court of appeals judge steven agee noted there was no “evidentiary link showing that the storybooks are being implemented in a way that directly or indirectly coerces the parents or their children to believe or act contrary to their religious faith.”  
the supreme court reached out to take this case at a very early stage and potentially decide it on a group of parents’ claims despite the fact that the case had not yet proceeded to the point where there was a record of how the books were actually being used in the classroom.
the authors and illustrators of books at issue in this lawsuit issued a statement in support of inclusive books: “we stand in support of the montgomery county school district. we oppose censoring or segregating books, like ours, that feature lgbtq+ people. all families deserve to be seen and heard. to act otherwise is harmful and sends a devastating message to students: that their lives and families are so offensive and dangerous that they can’t even be discussed in school.”
the books include the picture book uncle bobby’s wedding, a celebration of family featuring a girl who finds that her favorite uncle’s marriage means she’s gaining another uncle, not losing one. the book was selected as a best picture book honoree by kirkus reviews. author sarah brannen told mombian’s dana rudolph: “children need to see themselves in books. the books in the lawsuit need to be in the school and accessible to all the children in the school, without interference… we all know by now that banning books is the first step toward banning people.”
the authors of jacob’s room to choose (about making schools and restrooms safe for all children) wrote in time: “we believe that people have a fundamental right to practice and express their faith, but not when it harms others. allowing families to opt their children out of reading our books hurts the children whose lives and families are reflected in those books. “opt-out” policies starkly communicate to classrooms of children that behaving decently to all human beings is optional and tells kids who are different that they and their families don’t merit the respect of all their classmates.”
there has been prior precedent in the federal circuit courts ruling in favor of access to inclusive books. for example, in 2008, the u.s. supreme court declined to hear an appeal by two lexington, mass., couples, leaving in place a first circuit court of appeals decision that, like four other federal circuit courts of appeals, held that participation in public school instruction cannot alone burden the right to free exercise of religion absent some “coercive effect.” the first court held that merely exposing a child to ideas that conflict with the religious beliefs of their parents “does not inhibit the parent from instructing the child differently.”
opt-out policies are costly for taxpayers, student education, and schools: “the administrative burden of having to notify parents, collect their responses, answer any questions they may have about the material, and determine what the opted-out students will do during class time when the lgbtq books are read may dissuade schools from including lgbtq books in the first place.”
center for american progress: book bans “require tens of thousands of hours from teachers, librarians, and administrators to review the books and implement a system of censorship—all at a time when school resources are already stretched thin, and states across the country are facing teacher and staff shortages.”
first book research & insights: a poll of 1,500 teachers and librarians revealed “book bans are negatively impacting their ability to teach,” undermine their expertise, and “contribute to a sense of erasing people and history.” of the respondents, “72 percent noted that when students’ access to books is restricted, their reading engagement declines.”
everylibrary institute: polling and surveys reveal “a significant majority of the public opposes book bans, with a substantial majority of voters in some surveys supporting state legislation to protect individuals’ rights to read freely. some surveys show that as many as three-quarters of voters believe that ensuring people have access to diverse books is essential. more than half of americans appear to feel that book bans infringe on their right to make decisions for their children.”","['supreme', 'court', 'united', 'states', 'schedule', 'hear', 'oral', 'argument', 'mahmoud',

nearly half of all lgbtq americans (48%) are religiously affiliated, according to a 2023 prri poll. this same study found that strong majorities of all americans, including most people of faith, support nondiscrimination protections for lgbtq individuals. 

notable anti-lgbtq incidents targeting affirming religious communities

3/9/25: multiple people made death threats against the first congregational united church of christ in park ridge, new jersey, after the local moms for liberty chapter posted about the church’s pride flag and falsely claimed it supported “pedophilia.” one of the threats claimed that the church must be punished “with gasoline and a match.”
1/22/25: multiple people sent death threats to bishop mariann edgar budde at the episcopal diocese of washington d.c., following her sermon during president trump’s inauguration where she called for mercy on lgbtq and immigrant people. 
9/7/24: a person vandalized the pride-themed walkway leading to the immanuel congregational church in hartford, connecticut. the graffiti read: “fuck f****ts,” and occurred a week prior to the church’s pride event. 
8/17/24: a person tore down a pride flag at the home of a local rabbi in south whitehall township, pennsylvania, and blew it up with fireworks. they then x’d out the word “gay” on the flag with spray paint. 
7/28/24: a person stole pride flags and left anti-lgbtq letters at two churches in natick, massachusetts. at first congregational church and christ lutheran church, multiple pride flags were damaged and replaced with a banner that read: “jesus is king.”
6/17/24: a person was arrested for planning a mass murder targeting lgbtq people, religious institutions, hospitals, schools, and supermarkets in owosso, michigan. police reported that they found an israeli flag in the suspect’s home with the words “anti-jew f****t killer” and “death to you all.”
despite the fear these incidents aim to inspire, they instead shed light on the heroic figures at the head of these groundbreaking and affirming faith-based communities. the alert desk sat down with leaders from across the religious spectrum to speak about their experiences with anti-lgbtq hate and how they overcome it to serve all people.

“we are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. whatever affects one directly affects all indirectly.” – martin luther king, jr.

these are the words that rev. mark suriano used to open his sermon at the first congregational united church of christ, the sunday after his church received death threats regarding their pride flag. 

rev. suriano continued: “i have always loved [this] quote from martin luther king jr., in theory. when he speaks of ‘an inescapable network of mutuality’ and ‘a single garment of destiny,’ my heart has always warmed. but this past week, i, for the first time, had the most palpable sense of these ideas in action… it was a weekend of terror, grief, and [exhaustion.] but, in the midst of all that, the outpouring of support far surpassed the hateful and violent rhetoric against us.” 

“i remain emotional about this physical manifestation of the ‘inescapable network of mutuality’ and the ‘seamless garment of destiny’ of which martin luther king, jr. spoke. i also am overwhelmed by the beautiful truth that what affects one of us directly affects all of us indirectly.”

presiding bishop elizabeth eaton of the evangelical lutheran church in america (ecla) echoed rev. suriano’s sentiments. “bullying and discrimination have no place in the body of christ, but, sadly, reminders are still needed. jesus’ command that we love one another does not come with a caveat about who we are to love. recent acts of violence at churches that affirm the lgbtqia+ community and the congregations’ supportive ministries must not be tolerated. as a church, we must be even more committed to lifting up the dignity, safety and humanity of our lgbtqia+ siblings or we will be worse off as a church and as a nation.” 

rev. terri steed pierce, an out pastor at the joy metropolitan community church in orlando, florida, has faced her fair share of hate, including demonstrators trying to disrupt her sunday service in recent weeks. she summed it up neatly: “we say ‘all people are welcome here,’ but all behaviors aren’t and that means those that come with hate… those who have a problem with that can take it up with jesus.”


photo by the sikh lgbtqia+ oral history project,“becoming boundless: how lgbtqia+ sikhs negotiate duality through sikhi in an ego-driven, binary world”
prabhdeep singh kehal leads the sikh lgbtqia+ oral history project and has seen firsthand the power of having religious leaders condemn anti-lgbtq hate. “working with lgbtqia+ sikh voices is an honor and one of the most rewarding experiences i have had in my life,” says kehal. “in a time when governments are using lgbtqia+ communities as fodder to consolidate their own conservative, theocratic agendas, it is queer and trans affirming spaces that keep the energy to fight back going. and that is why politicians and conservatives target the places of safety for which we have fought to create – within and outside faith-based spaces.” 

“faith leaders are at an important position in challenging these pathologizing, theocratic interpretations of lgbtqia+ lives because ‘god’ is being used again to turn an entire group of people into a target for those already in power… their voices and positions are needed and that is why they are being targeted, because affirming and supporting faith leaders are able to speak back against claims that the divine advocates for harming lgbtqia+ beings.” 

ravjot mehek singh, a queer sikh activist and award-winning filmmaker, added on: “as a sikh in post 9/11 america, the racist attacks i experienced growing up in a predominantly white community left me traumatized and in doubt of my own identity. with my queerness, i get attacked oftentimes by my own community of conservative sikhs, especially online where i am constantly doxxed and my videos collect thousands of hateful, violent comments. because of my intersectional identity, i switch between facing threats from americans and my own community – creating an often endless loop of hate… but sikhi was founded to include all people regardless of gender or social standing, and i hope that the work i do alongside other brilliant advocates helps push for that equality to be acknowledged in its truest form.” 

“there is no right way to be queer, there is no right way to be sikh, there is no right way to be american, and anyone who tries to silence the way you exist in this world is a victim that is unable to comprehend the incredible multitudes that you contain. there is no rulebook to existing as oneself, so pursue all the things that make you feel whole.”

as president & ceo of keshet, a national lgbtq jewish organization, idit klein knows all too well what it’s like to be at the intersection of communities under attack. “it has been an especially painful and complex time for american jews in the wake of the october 7th hamas attacks, the ensuing bloodshed and suffering in israel and gaza, and rising antisemitism here in the u.s. it also is an increasingly dangerous time for lgbtq+ people as we face growing attacks on our rights and protections across the country. against this backdrop, keshet believes that remaining connected to each other across identities and movements is more important than ever.” 

“as an organization committed to the full equality of lgbtq+ jews, we know that we cannot ever separate these parts of ourselves,” said klein. “we work for a world free of homophobia, transphobia, and antisemitism. we work to find meaning and strength in this painful moment as many of us navigate rupture, uncertainty, and fear, whether in political spaces in our jewish communities, and/or lgbtq+ spaces.” 

keshet’s bay area education and training manager rabbi eliana kayelle spoke powerfully to how lgbtq jews can find hope in these challenging times. “as a trans queer jew this moment has me feeling the legacy of resilience deep in my bones. i’m thinking about jewish ancestors. miriam who, while under pharaoh’s rule, held onto hope, planning for liberation by crafting instruments she would eventually use to dance out of mitzrayim. emma goldman and hannah arendt, who remind me of the importance of action even when circumstances look bleak. these ancestors remind me that hope is not false optimism — it’s the desperate and powerful force that lives in our guts, the feeling that can move us to fight to repair a broken world.”

“i’m holding onto queer and trans ancestors and changemakers, especially trans women of color, drag queens and butches, who laid the groundwork for the queer liberation movement. the ones who became leaders because they had to. it is because of their work that i can shout: ‘i am here and i’m not going anywhere no matter how hard you try!’ i think of miss major griffin-gracy saying: ‘i don’t need their permission to exist; i exist in spite of them…we have a history, we have a reason to be here. we have a purpose.’ and i think: yes.”

as president of inter-intra community, malik johnson ministers to incarcerated muslims, including those who identify as lgbtq. “someone might write in and say, ‘i’m a gay man who wants to be a part of the muslim community in my [prison] facility, but i cannot because the others said that you cannot be gay and muslim, and they will not let me pray with them. i feel very isolated from people and from the religion itself.’ another might ask me, ‘what does it say in the quran about me being trans?’”

“the beautiful thing is that the quran doesn’t mention how queer a person has to be or not be to be sentenced to a heaven or a hell,” johnson stated. “instead the quran relays [its message] in terms of action. what are your actions? what are you doing with your life? how are you treating other people?”

“everyone has their own interpretation of what the quran could mean. so i instead respond [to these questions] by addressing the heart. the first thing i say is ‘you matter.’ i say, ‘thank you so much for calling or writing in. you are the most important part of this community. you mean so much. you’re very special. you’re worth something. if for no one else, you mean something to me. i love you and your creator loves you. because if your creator didn’t love you, then they would not have created you and they would not have brought us together.’”

“you’re giving authority back to that person when you ask questions of them. take someone who is trans. they have their dead name, that they used pre-transition, and they have their living name or preferred name. if that person is incarcerated, their dead name is continuously said to them. but if someone were to say, ‘what’s the name that you would like to be called?,’ it gives a symbol of hope and understanding and compassion. it gives back to that person so now that person is the authority in themselves. and that’s powerful. the best way to have autonomy is to name yourself.”

as we enter the holy season for those of so many faiths – from the end of ramadan and passover, to the start of easter and vaisakhi – let us remember these courageous leaders, who recognize our shared humanity and advocate for the importance of our diverse identities in fighting hate for all. in the words of the interfaith alliance, “while there are a variety of theological understandings of human sexuality and gender, we can all unite around the belief that nobody should fear for their safety or face discrimination based on who they love or who they are.”","['june', 'glaad', 'alert', 'desk',

9bcdf867-9c34-40e3-980f-ccef2e18c29f,pro,research explores how trans technologies are removing barriers to access and visibility,"['research', 'explore', 'trans', 'technology', 'remove', 'barrier', 'access', 'visibility']",glaad,jae moore,https://glaad.org/research-explores-how-trans-technologies-are-removing-barriers-to-access-and-visibility/,4/10/25,"trans technologies, a new book from mit press and written by university of michigan researcher and faculty member oliver l. haimson, ph.d. explores the creative and novel ways technologies are being utilized to address the inequalities the transgender community faces, highlight and correct misinformation, and grow safety, acceptance, equitability, and visibility.

“trans technologies,” as haimson explains in the book (he also includes definitions from trans tech creators), are “built or adapted to address the specific concerns and needs of trans people and communities.” on a more theoretical level, trans technologies “embody or support themes or characteristics of transness.” haimson uses a broad brush to paint his definition, adapting the concept to a wide variety of digital and analog applications “designed or adapted to help address some of the challenges transgender people face,” including basic needs such as access to society, employment, health care, and housing. examples include, but are not limited to:

apps – u-signal, a prototype smartphone and smartwatch app to aid transgender people of color in identifying and reporting threats to their safety. the safe transgender bathroom app (2021-22) helped trans people find safe/gender-neutral restrooms.
maps – trans activist and journalist erin reed created a map to assist trans people with finding health care providers who offer hormone therapy without requiring patients to obtain a letter of eligibility “from a therapist or psychiatrist.” reed also created a map to identify legislative attacks against the transgender community in each state.
websites – the digital transgender archive offers a collection of historical transgender materials, including periodicals, news articles, photography.
browser extensions – deadname remover updates “trans people’s previous names with their current ones,” while gender neutralize replaces gendered terms with “gender-neutral alternatives.”
video games, augmented reality, and virtual reality – through the wardrobe uses augmented reality to empower “visitors [to] try out new identities via clothing and other artifacts.” trans fucking rage jam (2022) gave trans game developers the agency to channel their anger over anti-trans legislation into creative projects. woven throughout the book, “care” and “ambivalence” serve as grounding forces, illustrating the (sometimes simultaneous) push and pull each trans tech creator faces in concepting and creating technology to meet their own individual needs or, more ideally, working with the broader transgender community, including people with multiple marginalized identities, to address one or more of the 14 categories of challenges transgender people face, as identified by haimson and his team of researchers. the u-signal prototype addresses “racial injustice,” for example, while the safe transgender bathroom app targeted “access to society.” another category, “pressure to educate cisgender people about trans identities,” includes the trans language primer, a web site that defines more than 200 lgbtq terms.

“trans care” demonstrates the ways transgender people “show up for each other when society and family fail them.” meanwhile, ambivalence, a word haimson notes “has a particularly trans quality,” involves “two or more distant (maybe opposite) poles between which a person wavers and that they contemplate simultaneously.” for example, trans tech creators “have agency to create technology that addresses some trans needs,” but can’t solve the societal issues at the root of them – a moving target that continues to grow with each anti-lgbtq executive order issued, law enacted, and the continued proliferation of hate speech online and in public settings.

another ambivalence includes funding sources for trans technology: “capitalist and anticapitalist approaches, funders’ values and community values, paid work and volunteer work, profit and mutual aid,” among others. “while each of these pairs may seem like opposites,” haimson explains, “in reality they are closer than they seem,” and may involve more than one approach.

trans technologies comes at a critical moment for the transgender community. since assuming office in january, president donald trump has spent an outsize amount of time targeting transgender people and censoring evidence of their existence. these efforts include restricting federal websites from nearly 200 words used to describe marginalized people and communities, including lgbtq, gender-affirming care, transgender, nonbinary, black, race and racism, dei, and yes, even the word “marginalized” itself.

also at risk is important and life-saving academic research. president trump’s recent anti-transgender executive orders have attempted to withdraw hundreds of research grants at several prominent educational institutions. in response, and to protect federal funding, universities throughout the country are scaling back or ending dei efforts.

haimson explained to glaad the cooling effect the trump administration’s harmful actions could have on future transgender research, including studies on the impact of trans technology on the community:

“the funding cuts to scientific research and universities will have tangible negative effects for so many marginalized groups, including trans people,” haimson said.

“with the crackdown on ‘dei’ research and the list of words that academics have been advised to no longer use in grant proposals, research that aims to improve trans people’s life chances is unlikely to be funded in the future (at least in the next four years). i have already seen my colleagues who are doing crucial trans health research have their nih grant funding taken away, which means that we will have less knowledge about health disparities and action towards how to address them.”

haimson warned that the absence of federal funding will require the support of trans folks “who typically have very little financial means and resources.”

trans technologies is the result of interviews with more than 100 english-speaking technology creators, 80 percent of whom are transgender and/or nonbinary. haimson acknowledges this limitation in not including non-western technologies and perspectives, and that he and many of his interviewees come from “relatively privileged” backgrounds in terms of education and socio-economic status. regardless, trans technologies offers readers a thorough, yet approachable look at the types of technologies and their effects, both positive and negative, on transgender people and the trans community at large.

trans technologies can be purchased through most major booksellers. a digital edition of the book is also available at no cost on the mit press website.","['trans', 'technology', 'new', 'book', 'mit',

c06d602f-2638-4fc8-bc16-9fe5f2d7b145,pro,election 2025: wisconsin’s supreme court candidates on the record,"['election', 'wisconsin', 'supreme', 'court', 'candidate', 'record']",glaad,jae moore,https://glaad.org/election-2025-wisconsins-supreme-court-candidates-on-the-record/,3/24/2025,"early voting has begun for the april 1 election for wisconsin’s supreme court. susan crawford and brad schimel are running for a 10-year term. these are their records on lgbtq issues: 

in response to the question from pbs wisconsin, “do trans people have any specific protections under the law? are they a protected class? do they get any other category of protection when it comes to them being singled out as a group?”

crawford: “that is a question where if a case came in front of me, that was making an argument about the rights of transgender people or making a claim that they’d been discriminated against or something like that, i would have to look at the law and see what protections were available, and hear out what the attorney’s arguments were both for and against those kinds of protections. obviously, look at the facts to see what was happening in that case. and then make a decision based on what i thought the facts and the law required.”
schimel: “under the law, they’re not in a particular protected class, no, but in a courtroom, in the justice system, you don’t have to be in a protected class to enjoy, to enjoy our constitutional rights. you know, i, i do name changes. every monday morning is when we hold name change hearings. and i have — it’s routine that i have individuals who have transitioned or are transitioning, want to change their names. i respect them for that decision, and i make those name changes as a matter of routine. i’ve even had some cases where they’ve undergone gender change operation and want to change their birth certificate. the law provides that they can do that. that’s what the law provides. my personal opinions have nothing to do with that.” crawford’s lgbtq history:

“represented planned parenthood in challenging, along with the state and national aclu, a 2013 law signed by republican gov. scott walker that required abortion providers to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals.” the aclu noted “a federal judge blocked the law,” a decision that was upheld by a federal appeals court in both 2013 and 2015.
called the 2022 overturning of roe v. wade “wrongly decided,” and noted it marked “the first time the court has ever taken away a right that was recognized and long vested under our united states constitution.” crawford said she found it “deeply concerning … when the government starts invading some of those fundamental decisions that men and women make every day about how to live their lives and what’s best for them and their families.”
in an interview with the daily cardinal (university of wisconsin–madison’s student newspaper), crawford told young voters she is “looking to protect their rights under our constitution and under our state laws and make sure that their fundamental freedoms are protected.” referencing brad schimel’s remarks against reproductive freedom, she added, “i think young people should be concerned about a candidate who has an extreme position like that and is so willing to take rights away from people.”
in a guest column in the cap times, crawford affirmed her commitment “to protecting the fundamental rights and freedoms of all wisconsinites.” drawing from her personal experience, crawford said she “represented planned parenthood of wisconsin and their doctors to protect women’s access to reproductive health care services.”
said she prefers a “common sense” approach to reproductive rights rather than being labeled as “pro-choice,” a term she avoids “because of its policy implications and the way it’s been politicized.” schimel’s lgbtq history:

in 2014, while campaigning for attorney general, “schimel pledged to defend wisconsin’s ban on same-sex marriage and initially said he would refuse to uphold a 2009 state law granting domestic partnership benefits to same-sex couples.” schimel later shifted his position on the latter, but remained committed “to enforcing the state’s same-sex marriage ban.”
compared same-sex couples to nazi skinheads in describing the religious exemption rights of masterpiece cakeshop plaintiff who fought to the u.s. supreme court to discriminate against a gay couple shopping for a wedding cake: “what if a person who is a minority owns a store and a couple of nazi skinheads come in and demand that [the owner] provides a service?” schimel said. “can that person say no? i don’t know that they can if the supreme court decides that [the bakery owner] can be forced to make this cake.” 
as attorney general, hired misha tseytlin to be solicitor general. tseytlin “played a central role in crafting the legal strategy to dismantle roe v. wade.” schimel has an extensive record of attacks against reproductive freedom and once said wisconsin has no “constitutional right to abortion.”
ap: wisconsin taxpayers paid about $1,000 to send one of schimel’s top lawyers to an event sponsored by alliance defending freedom, a group with a long history of advocating against lgbtq people and equality and a designated hate group by southern poverty law center. schimel claimed the group only wants to make sure “lgbtq+ rights did not interfere with the rights of other people.”
accused the wisconsin supreme court’s liberal, female majority of being “driven by their emotions” in determining whether to uphold the state’s 1849 abortion ban. “you could see it in their eyes, and you could hear it in the tone of their voice.”
at a recent campaign event in prairie du chien, wisconsin, schimel sided with business owners who wished to use religious grounds to turn away lgbtq couples. when an “attendee asked whether schimel would do anything to protect ‘those of us who don’t want to hire or offer services’ to people whose marriages ‘violate our religious beliefs,’ schimel responded, ‘your religious rights need to be protected.’” in a 2017 interview with wisconsin eye, schimel suggested that marriage equality could pave the way for lgbtq couples to “take their right to be married and now infringe on the legitimate religious liberty beliefs or rights of a person who is an artist. this isn’t going down to the corner grocery store and buying a box of ding dongs. this is somebody who creates art.” in fact, the opposite happened: attempts at expanding religious exemptions to more scenarios to discriminate against lgbtq people followed the narrow ruling in masterpiece. anti-lgbtq legal group alliance defending freedom reportedly shopped for plaintiffs to continue to challenge anti-discrimination laws in 303 creative, featuring a web designer who had not been approached by any lgbtq person or couple.
expressed willingness to enforce a ban on marriage equality if the u.s. supreme court overturns obergefell v. hodges. at a campaign event in prairie du chien, wisconsin, schimel said: “we have a constitutional amendment that’s still on the books.” schimel previously explained his personal beliefs on marriage equality in an interview with eye on oshkosh in 2014, 18 months before the u.s. supreme court’s obergefell decision legalized marriage equality nationwide: “as i do my job as attorney general, my personal view on that issue has no business entering into the equation. my job as the state’s lawyer is to defend wisconsin’s law … until the supreme court says it’s unconstitutional or the people change it. so, you start with that, but my view is i favor traditional marriage: one man, one woman. that’s my personal view in my personal life, and that’s how i voted when the marriage amendment was on the ballot. now, that doesn’t mean that i don’t accept that people of the same sex can be deeply in love with each other, and committed to each other. i wonder whether the government ought to be in the marriage business at all, and whether we ought to leave that to religion and other things.”
criticized transgender singer laura jane grace, who opened a wisconsin rally held by sen. bernie sanders with a performance of “your god.” schimel said the song was an “absolutely grotesque attack on people of faith.” 
ran an anti-transgender ad campaign featuring a parent accusing susan crawford of supporting the “radical agenda” of special interests. “let transitioning males use my girls’ bathrooms at school? allow boys to compete against them in sports? giving puberty-blocking drugs to children without parents’ consent? that’s who susan crawford sides with.”
refused to comment on anti-transgender text messages from “win wisconsin, win the future,” a group which is not “registered with the state, the federal election commission or the internal revenue service.” the texts ask if “parents should have the right to know if their child is transitioning genders at school” and warn “issues like this could be decided by the wi supreme court.”
fair wisconsin, the state’s only statewide lgbtq+ civil rights and political advocacy organization, issued a statement on the election: “brad schimel would be a dangerous addition to the wisconsin supreme court because he poses a threat to our rights, both for the rights of wisconsinites in general and for the lgbtq+ community in particular. schimel has recently launched an anti-trans attack ad, and i find his cynical attempt to sow fear by preying on our trans friends, family, and neighbors in wisconsin absolutely disgusting. as i have said before in the face of anti-trans attacks, we cannot let these ugly ads work. people are not issues; children are not weapons; health care, safety, and support are for everyone. every bill passed into law, and every decision made by a court has an impact on the lgbtq+ community, and that is why we need to have a court we can rely on to protect our rights as wisconsinites, including lgbtq+ wisconsinites – our rights to safety, health, and the freedom to live as our authentic selves and love who we love.”

glaad statement: “all elections are a chance for voters to use their voices, and the wisconsin supreme court race is one with a ten-year impact on lgbtq people as well as fairness and impartiality. voters can review the lgbtq records of the candidates to understand how they will defend or dismantle protections for lgbtq people, as well as reproductive rights. the election on april 1 will have a profound and lasting influence on the safety and equality of all wisconsinites.”

the court is expected to decide the future of abortion in the state and could redraw a congressional map. 

in addition, there is a proposed constitutional amendment on the ballot that seeks to embed wisconsin’s voter id law into the state constitution. wisconsin currently requires voters to present their photo id in person at the polls.

according to the milwaukee journal sentinel, “the referendum isn’t asking whether to get rid of or keep that law. it’ll remain in place regardless of the referendum results.” instead, it seeks to permanently add the voter id law into the state constitution.
crawford previously expressed opposition to the law and called it “draconian,” but declined to share how she would vote. schimel is in favor of the state’s voter id law and said he would support the resolution.
strict voter id laws can create barriers for transgender people, “both because of difficulties in obtaining an id that’s accepted, or because they might run into bias or misunderstandings of the law when it comes to their gender.”
unelected billionaire elon musk has endorsed schimel and donated to groups that have reportedly spent more than $10 million in ads against schimel’s opponent, susan crawford (including one that used a photo of the wrong individual to represent crawford). investigative reporters have noted that the groups have posted facebook ads making false claims about crawford’s position on cash bail. crawford has not taken a position on cash bail.

the glaad alert desk (anti-lgbtq extremism reporting tracker) has documented 47 anti-lgbtq incidents in wisconsin since june 2022, including three bomb threats, three cases of vandalism, and two assaults. examples include:

on feb. 1, 2025, an individual mailed anti-lgbtq letters to an lgbtq person / former pastor at their home in oak creek, wisconsin. the letters addressed the victim, calling them a “queer piece of sh*t.”
starting on march 8, 2024, at least four bomb threats were called into butler middle school in waukesha, wisconsin. the threats followed a post by libs of tiktok four days prior, which showed a school employee posting about his partner and saying: “acceptance, equity and inclusion should be cornerstones of our schools.”
(tw) on feb. 26, 2023, an individual shot and killed a transgender woman at her apartment in milwaukee, wisconsin. the perpetrator allegedly filmed her death while making anti-trans

04.15.2025  sent a memo to lawmakers requesting that congress rescind $1.1 billion in federal funding from the corporation for public broadcasting, which contributes money to npr and pbs. the funding is already appropriated by congress. public broadcasters like npr and pbs have a track record of airing programming that highlights lgbtq stories, issues, and communities,  providing representation and education often not found on commercial networks. the white house memo advocating for the cuts specifically criticized pbs for airing programs featuring transgender characters.

04.04.2025  issued a proclamation recognizing national sexual assault awareness and prevention month that erroneously claims that assaults by undocumented immigrants are one of the leading causes of sexual violence. in fact, eight out of 10 rapes are committed by someone known to the victim, according to data from the department of justice. previous proclamations emphasized support for survivors and perpetrator accountability. trump was found liable for sexual abuse in 2023. 

04.04.2025  created a new title ix special investigations team focused on preventing transgender women and girls from women’s and girls’ sports teams and restrooms. the departments of education and justice jointly said that this team will “protect students, and especially female athletes, from the pernicious effects of gender ideology in school programs and activities.” title ix was enacted by congress in 1972 to protect students from discrimination “on the basis of sex.” ncaa president charlie baker testified in december 2024 that he knows of fewer than ten transgender college student athletes among 510,000 athletes total.

04.04.2025  targeted transgender people and health care in a proclamation declaring april national child abuse prevention month. the proclamation is defamatory and without basis and betrays the month’s purpose. trump’s proclamation singled out transgender care, and without basis, called it a form of child abuse. the proclamation does not address the most common risk factors for neglected or abused children.transgender people exist, and every major medical association and leading world health authority supports health care for transgender people and youth.   

03.24.2025  announced attempt to terminate at least 68 grants to 46 institutions, many of which were for research on the health of lgbtq people. the grants totaled nearly $40 million when awarded and are funded through congressional budget appropriation, which the executive branch does not control. most were in some way related to lgbtq health, including research on hiv prevention. other canceled studies centered on cancer, youth suicide, and bone health. the ap reports that, “one canceled project at vanderbilt university had been following the overall health of more than 1,200 lgbtq people age 50 and older.… ‘we now no longer have anywhere studying lgbt cancer in the united states,’” a researcher noted.

03.15.2025 shut down the 83-year-old voice of america (voa) asserting that the venerable international broadcasting state media network had distributed “radical propaganda,” citing a march 2019 segment about transgender migrants seeking asylum in the united states. the washington post‘s fact checker described this as an “ordinary news story” that was produced during the first trump administration. the trump administration has shut down voa and other u.s.-funded media by placing nearly all staff on administrative leave and terminating contracts with affiliated broadcasters, effectively silencing operations that had promoted democracy globally for decades.

03.07.2025 signed an executive order directing administration officials to modify the public service loan forgiveness program to exclude nonprofit organizations engaged in activities he baselessly described as having a “substantial illegal purpose.” the order to limit the program is aimed at organizations supporting immigrants, diversity initiatives, or transgender care for youth.

03.07.2025 the department of defense is reportedly flagging content for removal via keyword search including “gay,” meaning references to the enola gay, an airplane that dropped the atomic bomb on hiroshima, japan, would be scrubbed. the ap reports the “vast majority of the pentagon purge targets women and minorities, including notable milestones made in the military. and it also removes a large number of posts that mention various commemorative months—such as those for black and hispanic people and women.” additional content flagged includes a photo of an army corps of engineer that had an engineer with the last name gay, and a photo of army corps biologists “seemingly because it mentioned they were recording data about fish—including their weight, size, hatchery and gender.”

03.04.2025 falsely claimed in his address to congress that he “brought back free speech in america.” in fact, his administration has aggressively censored lgbtq people and identities in executive orders, from federal websites, in health care, and from the stonewall national monument website. 

03.04.2025 made the dangerous and misleading claim that $8 million in taxpayer dollars were going towards creating “transgender mice.” in fact, this baseless claim comes from a far-right watchdog group. transgenic mice are lab research mice that have been genetically altered to better model human disease response. they have been called a “revolutionary research resource” for medical advancements in asthma and cancer among other areas. 

03.04.2025 falsely claimed the usa was giving “$8 million to promote lgbtqi+ in the african nation of lesotho, which nobody has ever heard of.” in fact, the u.s. government does not support lgbtq initiatives in lesotho, but it does promote widely used health programs, particularly hiv/aids prevention and treatment. trump has previously disparaged african countries and haiti.

03.04.2025 touted his executive orders banning transgender women from sports and cited anti-transgender advocate payton mcnabb, a former volleyball player injured during a match against an alleged trans player. in fact, more than 214,000 female student athletes have been injured playing volleyball since 2012, with the vast majority of accidents involving cisgender players.

03.06.2025 marked women’s history month with a proclamation from the u.s. embassy in romania. the proclamation cited trump administration policies that impinge on the right of some people to have passports that accurately reflect their gender identities, to restrict some women from participating in sports, and to seek to define “sex” in a way that excludes transgender women from the protections of civil rights laws. trump’s own history with women includes nominating the supreme court justices who helped overturn the federal protections of roe, and a jury found trump liable for sexually abusing e. jean carroll in 1996, awarding her $5 million. in a leaked 2005 access hollywood tape, trump was recorded bragging about kissing and groping women without their consent. trump defended several political allies accused of sexual misconduct or domestic abuse, including his first nominee for attorney general matt gaetz, defense secretary pete hegseth, hhs secretary robert f. kennedy, jr., and education secretary linda mcmahon who is accused of enabling child sex assault when she led the wwe. more than 40 women have publicly accused trump of various forms of sexual misconduct since the 1970s.

02.19.2025 rolled out a new hhs webpage, titled “protecting women and children,” that employs trump’s narrow and scientifically baseless definition of sex and asserts that gender-affirming care is a form of child abuse. the department is promoting a rigid definition of sex that excludes transgender identities, falsely framing gender-affirming care as “chemical and surgical mutilation” and targeting trans inclusion in sports. in fact, every major medical association and leading world health authority supports health care for transgender people and youth. the site section titled “keeping men out of women’s sports,” repeats far-right rhetoric used to justify bans on transgender women athletes. 

02.18.2025 added a baseless disclaimer to the top of government websites for the food and drug administration, the centers for disease control, and the health and human services after a federal judge ordered that web pages that contained vital information about trans people and other marginalized groups be reinstated. the pages were posted again with a false header that reads, “any information on this page promoting gender ideology is extremely inaccurate and disconnected from the immutable biological reality that there are two sexes, male and female… the trump administration rejects gender ideology and condemns the harms it causes to children, by promoting their chemical and surgical mutilation, and to women, by depriving them of their dignity, safety, well-being, and opportunities. this page does not reflect biological reality and therefore the administration and this department reject it.” the statement is false and contradicts global medical standards defining gender and sex. transgender people exist. every major medical association and leading world health authority supports health care for transgender people and youth.  

02.14.2025 national park service removes the word “transgender” from the stonewall national monument website. transgender people were central in the stonewall riots and remain essential in the past, present and future of the lgbtq movement.

02.10.2025 signed an executive order to target mainstream essential health care for transgender youth, using inaccurate and inflammatory graphic language. the care is supported by every major medical association and has been prescribed for decades, including throughout the first trump administration. the order was blocked by a federal judge and prohibits federal agencies from conditioning or withholding federal funding based on the fact that a healthcare entity or professional provides gender-affirming medical care to a patient under nineteen.

02.10.2025 removed “t” from state department travel advisory website which now only offers guidance for “lgb” travelers.

02.07.2025 department of justice directs federally-funded nonprofit organizations including the national center for missing and exploited children (ncmec) to remove references to transgender people from public materials. the verge reported that three reports previously on the ncmec website had become inaccessible, each of which mentioned lgbtq people. lgbtq youth are among the most vulnerable to housing insecurity, violence, and abuse.

02.04.2025 paused foreign development assistance, including hiv drug supply to usaid-supported countries. marco rubio, as secretary of state, has been put in charge of usaid while pete marocco, a trump appointee, manages the defunding and dismantling of usaid programs. usaid supported hiv treatment and prevention programs, including pepfar, which provided lifesaving treatment to millions of people in 54 countries. in addition to hiv programs, usaid supported the rights of lgbtq people in dominican republic, uganda, bangladesh, kosovo, and guatemala, and worked with lgbtq populations across central asia, the middle east, and north africa.

02.04.2025 froze applications for the gender-neutral “x” marker on u.s. passports. the option had been added in 2021 by the biden administration. several countries worldwide already offer options other than male and female on official documents. india, pakistan and nepal already have a nonbinary option, and  the netherlands issued its first gender-neutral passport in 2018.

02.02.2025 directed schools to stop using federal funding for purposes related to “gender ideology.” transgender people are real, and not an ideology. more here on the origins of the phrase used to dehumanize trans people.

01.27.2025 signed an executive order directing the secretary of defense to reinstate a ban on transgender people serving in the military. this policy prohibits transgender people from enlisting, bars currently serving transgender personnel from transitioning, and ends the use of authentic pronouns. the order revokes biden’s policies that had allowed transgender troops to serve openly and access transition-related medical care and reversed protections for lgbtq people in military service, education, housing, and federal employment.

01.23.2025 moved some transgender women in prisons to administrative isolation and mandated that transgender women prisoners be detained in men’s prisons. 

01.23.2025 falsely claimed, among multiple baseless claims and wild exaggerations in a speech to global leaders at the world economic forum, that “there are only two genders, male and female. and we will have no men participating in women’s sports and transgender operations, which became the rage, will occur very rarely.” facts: science and medicine as well as cultures throughout history have long acknowledged wider diversity of gender. transgender women are women, and sometimes play sports. “transgender operations” are already quite rare.

01.20.2025 signed an executive order revoking multiple biden-era policies. this order revoked an executive order that addressed discrimination based on gender identity or sexual orientation. 

01.20.2025 ordered an end to diversity, equity and inclusion (dei) programs across the federal government, putting such staff on immediate administrative leave.

01.20.2025 the trump administration has eliminated nearly all lgbtq and hiv focused content and resources from the white house website, as well as eliminated lgbtq and hiv content from key federal agency webpages. mentions of “lesbian,” “bisexual,” “gay,” “transgender,” “sexual orientation,” “gender identity,” and related terms are no longer accessible on whitehouse.gov, and the search term “lgbtq” now brings up zero results on the site. in addition, some lgbtq-specific pages have been taken down from the centers for disease control, department of state, and more. 

01.20.2025 signed an executive order declaring that the federal government would recognize only two immutable sexes: male and female. the order aims to  prevent taxpayer funds from being used for gender-transition health care and add “privacy in intimate spaces” in facilities such as prisons, migrant shelters and rape shelters. in fact, the development of the human body is a complex process, and sex is not solely determined by anatomy, nor is it strictly binary. as many as 1.7% of people are born with an intersex trait.

2024
10.28.2024 repeatedly referred to cnn’s anderson cooper as “allison” at a rally in michigan when cooper’s town hall with vice president kamala harris came up. the anti-lgbtq and misogynistic rhetoric evokes the trope of gay men as effeminate, suggesting that gay men are women and that being a woman is degrading.

10.13.2024 aired a anti-transgender campaign ad that pictured vice president kamala harris superimposed with transgender members of the biden administration and a scene lifted from the television show orange is the new black of inmates in prison jumpsuits. “kamala supports taxpayer funded sex changes for prisoners and illegal aliens. kamala is for they/them. president trump is for you.” the assertion echoes a statement trump made in the presidential debate with harris: “now she wants to do transgender operations on illegal aliens that are in prison.” in fact, by law the government must provide medical care to prisoners and immigrant detainees. during trump’s presidency, officials at the bureau of prisons, which operates under the justice department, facilitated transgender health care for a limited number of incarcerated individuals who sought such care. this policy was implemented throughout trump’s four-year term, despite his administration’s public stance on transgender issues.

09.10.24. in the presidential debate trump said, “now [kamala harris] wants to do transgender operations on illegal aliens that are in prison.” in fact, by law the government must provide medical care to prisoners and immigrant detainees. during trump’s presidency, officials at the bureau of prisons, which operates under the justice department, facilitated transgender health care for a limited number of incarcerated people who sought such care. this policy was implemented during trump’s term.

09.04.2024 lied about access to gender-affirming care for minors, saying at a moms for liberty summit, “think of it, your kid goes to school and comes home a few days later with an operation….the school decides what’s going to happen with your child.” the statement is a false, gross misrepresentation of the highly regulated process of transgender health care for minors in the united states. no children are going to school and receiving surgery there for gender dysphoria.

08.02.2024 in an interview at the national association of black journalists conference he falsely questioned vice president kamala harris‘ racial identity, claiming she “happened to turn black” a few years ago and suggesting she previously only promoted her indian heritage. the lie echos his previous racist remarks, such as the “birther” conspiracy theories he promoted against former president barack obama.

07.18.2024 during 90-minute nomination acceptance speech at the republican national convention, he repeats baseless disinformation about transgender women and girls participating in sports. glaad’s voter poll shows a majority of voters in all parties oppose “a political candidate [who] speaks frequently about restricting access to health care and participation in sports for transgender youth.”

07.10.2024  campaign website includes formal policy plans called “agenda 47” that includes a pledge titled “president trump’s plan to protect children from left-wing gender insanity.” the advocate reports, “trump promised to outlaw gender-affirming care for minors at the federal level, and ‘cease all programs that promote the concept of sex and gender transition at any age.’ he also promised to ban transgender athletes from competing on teams that match their gender identity.… trump stated that he ‘will ask congress to pass a bill establishing that the only genders recognized by the united states government are male and female — and they are assigned at birth.’ he then claimed that being transgender was ‘invented’ by the ‘radical left,’ though he did not use the term ‘transgender’ once throughout agenda 47.”

06.21.24  announced that if elected for a second term, he would cut federal funding for inclusive schools: “on day one, i will sign a new executive order to cut federal funding of any school pushing critical race theory, transgender insanity, and other inappropriate racial, sexual, or political content onto the lives of our children.” he also announced his intent to target transgender people in sports.

05.17.2024 recommitted to criminalizing abortion, telling time that he would not intervene in decisions to monitor or prosecute pregnant people. he refused to say whether his second administration would enforce the comstock act, an 1873 “zombie law” that bans the mailing of “obscene” materials, including birth control and “instruments” used for abortions. the act has been unenforceable for the past 50 or so years, largely because it was rendered unconstitutional by roe v. wade, which trump has repeatedly taken credit for overturning.

05.14.2024 vowed to roll back title ix protections for transgender student enacted in april 2024 by the u.s. department of education “on day one,” if he’s reelected. trump said: “we’re going to end it on day one. don’t forget, that was done as an order from the president. that came down as an executive order. and we’re going to change it—on day one it’s going to be changed…. it’ll be terminated.”

04.08.2024 stated his current position on abortion on his social media platform in a video saying, “my view is now that we have abortion where everyone wanted it from a legal standpoint, the states will determine by vote or legislation, or perhaps both. and whatever they decide must be the law of the land. in this case, the law of the state.” in the same video he made the baseless claim that democrats want to legalize the “execution” of babies that were already born, which is not true. trump’s position on abortion rights has changed many times from saying he is “very pro-choice” in 1999, to personally taking credit for overturning roe vs. wade in 2022, to saying florida’s six-week abortion ban is “a terrible mistake” in 2023, to saying he would “be open” to a 15 week ban in 2024.

04.04.2024 announced he would declare november 5 to be “christian visibility day” after a baseless complaint about transgender day of visibility coinciding with easter in 2024. previously trump campaign spokesperson karoline leavitt issued a statement calling it “appalling and insulting” that biden “formally proclaimed easter sunday as ‘trans day of visibility.’ ”

03.16.2024 defended ohio senate primary candidate bernie moreno, whose email address was used to create an account on adult friend finder in 2008 seeking “men for 1-on-1 sex.” moreno’s campaign said the account was created by an intern as a prank. trump defended moreno and claimed “democratic fake treatment” for the story moreno’s campaign had confirmed: “we all know this man. he’s a hero, he’s a winner and we’re not going to let these people — these people are sick.”

03.16.2024 appeared at a campaign rally for ohio senate primary candidate bernie moreno, sponsored by the pro-moreno buckeye values pac. the pac released an ad targeting a moreno rival as “a champion for trans equality.” the pac also reportedly sent campaign mail asking “what team does frank larose play for?” and “is he with us … or is he with they/them?”

03.04.2024 endorsed north carolina lt. governor mark robinson for governor, despite robinson’s history of anti-lgbtq disinformation and rhetoric, including calling gay people “filth” and “maggots.” trump repeated his past claims that robinson is “better than martin luther king” and “martin luther king on steroids.” 

02.02.2024 used vulgar slang to refer to lgbtq legal icon roberta kaplan, who represented e. jean carroll against trump. trump was found liable for sexually abusing carroll in the 1990s and for defaming her by mocking her claims after he left the white house. a jury awarded carroll with $83 million in damages. kaplan recalled leading the deposition of trump, saying that at the end trump’s lawyers asked to go “off the record,” meaning what he said would not be included on the court deposition transcript. kaplan said trump then said to her: “see you next tuesday,” a slang term referring to a word for female genitalia used as an insult for women.

02.20.2024 supported by the anti-lgbtq national organization heritage foundation with a 180-page document detailing regulations and executive orders to be taken in first days in office, including: “deleting [from federal agencies and federal rule] the terms sexual orientation and gender identity (“sogi”), diversity, equity, and inclusion., gender, gender equality, gender equity, gender awareness, gender-sensitive, abortion, reproductive health, reproductive rights;” limiting abortion access with executive orders using the comstock act — a long-inactive 19th century law that banned birth control and abortion medication by mail. semafor reported: while project 2025 bills itself as being “candidate agnostic,” [project director paul] dans noted that at this point in the primary, they expect “and hope” that donald trump will ultimately end up in office again. nbc news reported that project 2025 includes representatives from anti-lgbtq, anti-equality and anti-democracy groups “led by veterans of the trump administration, such as america first legal, the center for renewing america and the conservative partnership institute, the claremont institute, the family research council and the independent women’s forum.” (links to groups added by glaad).

01.10.2024 boasted of his role in the supreme court decision ending the right to abortion by nominating three of the justices who joined the decision: “if it weren’t for me, with roe v. wade, you wouldn’t even be talking about this stuff. for 54 years they were trying to get roe v. wade terminated, and i did it and i’m proud to have done it,” trump said. abortion is an lgbtq issue: lgbtq people can and do get pregnant, lesbian young women are two to ten times more likely to become pregnant than heterosexual youth, lesbian and bisexual women are often at higher risk of sexual assault due in part to their sexual orientation, which may also result in an unplanned pregnancy. 

2023
12.30.2023 criticized ohio gov. mike dewine for vetoing state bill banning essential health care for transgender youth and banning trans youth from school sports, spread disinformation about the care and school sports. dewine had said his veto was based on conversations he had with parents, patients and providers who told him how the care saves lives. trump said in a truth social post: “dewine has fallen to the radical left… what was he thinking. the bill would have stopped child mutilation, and prevented men from playing in women’s sports. legislature will hopefully overturn. do it fast!!!” ohio hospitals and providers, along with hundreds of others, had testified that they do not perform surgeries on youth, and ohio’s school sports association has long had policies to ensure inclusive participation of transgender students.

12.17.2023 announced on social media, “on day one [of a second term if he were reelected president], i will sign a new executive order to cut federal funding for any school pushing critical race theory, transgender insanity, and other inappropriate racial, sexual, or political content on our children…”

11.03.2023 mimicked a canadian weightlifter in an extended campaign event skit to mock and misgender transgender women in sports, claiming he will “end this on day one” if he’s re-elected.

09.13.2023 in “agenda47: president trump’s ten principles for great schools leading to great jobs” on trump’s campaign web site, he disparaged transgender people and includes misinformation about gender in eight of the ten principles. the agenda targets lgbtq people, particularly transgender people, by opposing gender-affirming care, restricting teachers from supporting transgender students, defining gender strictly as binary and assigned at birth, and eliminating lgbtq-inclusive curricula. these policies aim to remove recognition and support for transgender identities in education and healthcare while promoting a restrictive view of gender and sexuality.

05.17.2023 proudly stated, “i was able to kill roe v. wade,” taking credit for the supreme court overturning the national right to an abortion in the dobbs decision. the dobbs decision suggested that the right to same-sex marriage should be reconsidered by the court as well. 

06.11.2023 said of transgender athletes at a rally, “who would even think that you can allow this? who would say that this is okay? these people are sick. they are deranged…. it’s astonishing how passionately people react to that. when you talk about tax cuts, they remain calm. but when you mention transgender issues, everyone goes wild. who would have imagined five years ago that they wouldn’t even know what ‘it’ meant?”

04.14.2023 said that if re-elected, he would use the government to investigate and potentially halt transgender health care during a national rifle association (nra) speech. “upon my inauguration, i will direct the fda to convene an independent outside panel to investigate whether transgender hormone treatments and ideology increase the risk of extreme depression, aggression and even violence,” said trump. he also accused democrats of “pushing the transgender cult” on children.

03.26.2023 vowed to crack down on “transgender insanity” and pledged to “revoke every biden policy promoting the disfigurement of our youth” at the first rally of his 2024 presidential campaign. he said that he would “keep men out of women’s sports” if re-elected president, after he last year misgendered transgender athlete lia thomas. he added: “i will immediately sign an executive order to cut federal funding for any school pushing critical race theory, transgender insanity, and other racial, sexual or political content on our children.”

01.31.2023 made multiple false claims about gender affirming care, tweeting a so-called “plan to protect children from left-wing gender insanity.“ every major medical association and world health authority supports gender affirming care; statements here including from the american academy of pediatrics: “there is strong consensus among the most prominent medical organizations worldwide that evidence-based, gender-affirming care for transgender children and adolescents is medically necessary and appropriate. it can even be lifesaving. the decision of whether and when to start gender-affirming treatment, which does not necessarily lead to hormone therapy or surgery, is personal and involves careful consideration by each patient and their family.”

01.29.2023 at a campaign event, falsely claimed and without evidence or fact: “we’re going to stop the left-wing radical racists and perverts who are trying to indoctrinate our youth, and we’re going to get their marxist hands off our children…we’re going to defeat the cult of gender ideology and reaffirm that god created two genders: men and women. we’re not going to allow men to play women’s sports.”

living in alabama, i’m aware that every right we enjoy was won by the people—not simply granted by lawmakers. black elders in montgomery remind us that the montgomery bus boycott wasn’t just a symbolic protest—it was 381 days of relentless organizing, sacrifice, and resistance. these histories are blueprints for our movements today, and we need them now more than ever.

as a volunteer for montgomery pride united, i have witnessed how the lgbtq movement is sustained by elders who survived bar crackdowns, led revolutionary marches, and endured the hiv/aids crisis. and now, we’re seeing the state of alabama work to intentionally suppress this crucial history.

on the federal level, under the current administration, lgbtq people are facing an aggressive, coordinated effort to censor our stories and restrict equal access to public life. currently,  456 anti-lgbtq bills have been introduced across the united states. here’s what is at stake in alabama:

house bill 4 introduces the vague term “gender-oriented conduct” into the state obscenity law—an intentional tactic to ban books about queer and trans people from public libraries.
house bill 67 is a drag ban also designed to target and criminalize innocent trans people for simply existing in schools or libraries.
house bill 244 expands “don’t say gay” through 12th grade, further isolating queer and trans youth while censoring free speech, lgbtq history, and the contributions of queer and trans leaders from classrooms.
house bill 246, the “pronoun bill,” would prohibit public school, college, and university employees from using a student’s name or pronouns without explicit written parental permission.
the inaccurate and harmful act ignoring the existence of intersex, transgender, and nonbinary people , was recently signed by governor ivey. it enshrines medically inaccurate definitions of “male” and “female”and aims to block people from their own accurate identity documents and justifies bathroom restrictions that are vague and dangerously enforced. this bill takes effect on october 1.
anti-lgbtq bills have emboldened extremists on the ground in alabama.

these bills are not just targeting lgbtq people, they are a direct attack on first amendment freedoms. when alabama lawmakers passed an anti-dei law last year, a black student union was forced to give up its meeting space, excluding black students from necessary and safe places to find community. these actions are part of a broader strategy to roll back civil rights and silence those who challenge systemic oppression. in 2023, lawmakers threatened the alabama department of archives and history’s budget for inviting invisible histories, a community archive organization, to present a lecture on alabama’s rich, and too often untold, lgbtq history. since 2024, we have seen an increase in challenged and banned books across public libraries – including the pronoun book, the meaning of pride, the hate u give, and being you: a first conversation about gender. our local lgbtq community center, managed by montgomery pride united, has also heard from many queer teens that they fear repercussions by teachers and students alike for being themselves. this onslaught of oppressive laws is meant to make life harder for queer and transgender people in the state.

but here’s what lawmakers fail to understand: lgbtq people are not leaving alabama. no amount of hateful legislation will erase us. we are active in our communities, schools, churches, and in every facet of public life across the state. our history is our power. and right now, lawmakers are not just trying to ban books—they are trying to deny we exist online and in real life. you can help ensure this never happens by joining the collective effort to preserve lgbtq histories, both digitally and physically, by signing up with invisible histories, a community-based archive working with lgbtq organizations across the south to protect the legacy of lgbtq alabamians and help safeguard the online records of dei (diversity, equity, and inclusion) programs set to be eliminated because of the president’s executive order. we’ve survived attacks against lgbtq people before, and this time, we have the tools to protect our history. our elders were battle-tested, building movements from the ground up and laying the foundation for the social progress we no longer can take for granted. it is our turn to ensure their wisdom and resilience are imparted to future generations. lgbtq alabamians shouldn’t have to leave home to thrive, and those intent on making life intolerable for the most marginalized in our state should never be in the majority.","['freedom', 'passive', 'gift', 'fight',

the new york times, an outlet with a pattern of bias and inaccuracies within their coverage of transgender people, also covered the story. one times article caught the eye of many lgbtq people and allies, posted february 15th with a headline calling sam a trans man, which is an accurate description of sam. on february 16th, the headline was changed from trans man to man. late that same day, the headline was again changed, this time from man to person. sam and all victims of violence deserve accurate coverage of their lives. at a time when trans people and the word trans are literally being erased from government websites due to hate and anti-trans violence is increasing, sam’s identity as a man who was trans must not be hidden behind generic language.

why did the times change their headline about sam? many lgbtq people and allies wondered the same thing. all of these headline changes are available to view directly here at the internet archive, which archives webpages.

one additional article about sam was published in the times, on february 17th. it appears that the online headline of that story included transgender man from publish time to present (as of february 26th), and the descriptor transgender man was a part of the print headline too.

glaad and 100+ organizations and leaders have been calling out the times’ pattern of inaccurate, biased trans coverage since february 2023. the coalition recently placed a mobile billboard in front of times’ offices requesting a meeting between leaders from the trans community and times staff. requests for this meeting date back longer than two years, to which the times has not yet responded.

this legal battle threatens to expose lgbtq youth in the state to discredited, dangerous practices that have long been debunked by medical professionals and mental health experts.

conversion therapy, an attempt to “change” someone’s sexual orientation or gender identity, has caused irreparable harm to countless lgbtq individuals.

justice horn, a former chair of kansas city’s lgbtq commission, glaad media institute alum, and an outspoken activist, was instrumental in securing the passage of the kansas city and jackson county conversion therapy bans.

he called the attorney general’s lawsuit a dangerous step backwards: “by attempting to legalize child abuse, this lawsuit not only threatens the safety of lgbtq youth, but also sends a message that their lives are expendable,” horn said.

“we will fight, we will resist, and we will protect our lgbtq youth—because their lives, their safety, and their futures are non-negotiable.” the lawsuit, filed in the united states district court for the western district of missouri, targets both the kansas city and jackson county governments, challenging local ordinances passed in 2019 and 2023, respectively. these ordinances, which have overwhelming bipartisan support, were passed with one clear goal: to protect children and teenagers from conversion therapy—a harmful practice that has been repeatedly condemned by every major medical and mental health organization in the u.s.

since kansas city passed its ban in 2019, and jackson county followed suit in 2023, these ordinances have represented a crucial step in affirming the right of lgbtq people, particularly youth, to live authentically and free from coercion or abuse. they reflect an understanding that conversion therapy causes devastating harm, contributing to depression, anxiety, homelessness, and tragically, suicide. studies show that 25% of lgbtq youth who had undergone conversion therapy had attempted suicide within the previous 12 months—a stark reminder of the irreversible damage these practices cause.

according the trevor project, nearly 1 in 3 lgbtq young people said their mental health was poor most of the time or always due to anti-lgbtq policies and legislation, including conversion therapy.

the legal challenge by missouri’s attorney general could have devastating consequences for lgbtq youth, who are already at higher risk for mental health struggles and violence. experts agree that rather than helping individuals, conversion therapy compounds the emotional and psychological trauma faced by lgbtq people, particularly young people who are still finding their identity.

in the face of these efforts to roll back protections, the lgbtq+ community is standing firm. advocates are doubling down on their commitment to protecting lgbtq+ youth, ensuring that harmful practices like conversion therapy have no place in missouri—and beyond.

this fight isn’t just about one city or one county—it’s about the rights of lgbtq people everywhere to live without fear of harm or discrimination. the community’s response has been swift and resolute: “we will not allow our youth to be subjected to this abuse. we will continue to fight for their safety and dignity,” horn stated.

the movement to end conversion therapy is gaining momentum across the country, with more and more states passing laws to protect lgbtq youth from these discredited practices. but the missouri lawsuit serves as a stark reminder that the fight for lgbtq rights is ongoing, and that progress must be fiercely defended.

as the case unfolds, the lgbtq community remains united in its commitment to ensuring a future where all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity, can live their truth without fear of rejection, harm, or violence.","['shameless', 'alarming', 'missouri', 'attorney', 'general', 'andrew', 'bailey', 'week', 'file', 'lawsuit', 'reverse', 'protective', 'ban', 'conversion', 'therapy', 'kansas', 'city', 'jackson', 'county', 'legal', 'battle', 'threaten', 'expose', 'lgbtq', 'youth', 'state', 'discredit', 'dangerous', 'practice', 'long', 'debunk', 'medical', 'professional', 'mental', 'health', 'expert', 'conversion', 'therapy', 'attempt', 'change', 'sexual', 'orientation', 'gender', 'identity', 'cause', 'irreparable', 'harm', 'countless', 'lgbtq', 'individual', 'justice', 'horn', 'chair', 'kansas', 'city', 'lgbtq', 'commission', 'glaad', 'media', 'institute', 'alum', 'outspoken', 'activist', 'instrumental', 'secure', 'passage', 'kansas', 'city', 'jackson', 'county', 'conversion', 'therapy', 'ban', 'call', 'attorney', 'general', 'lawsuit', 'dangerous', 'step', 'backwards', 'attempt', 'legalize', 'child', 'abuse', 'lawsuit', 'threaten', 'safety', 'lgbtq', 'youth', 'send', 'message', 'life', 'expendable', 'horn', 'say', 'fight', 'resist', 'protect', 'lgbtq', 'youth', 'life', 'safety', 'future', 'non', 'negotiable', 'lawsuit', 'file', 'united', 'states', 'district', 'court', 'western', 'district', 'missouri', 'target', 'kansas', 'city', 'jackson', 'county', 'government', 'challenge', 'local', 'ordinance', 'pass', 'respectively', 'ordinance', 'overwhelming', 'bipartisan', 'support', 'pass', 'clear', 'goal', 'protect', 'child', 'teenager', 'conversion', 'therapy', 'harmful', 'practice', 'repeatedly', 'condemn', 'major', 'medical', 'mental', 'health', 'organization', 'kansas', 'city', 'pass', 'ban', 'jackson', 'county', 'follow', 'suit', 'ordinance', 'represent', 'crucial', 'step', 'affirm', 'right', 'lgbtq', 'people', 'particularly', 'youth', 'live', 'authentically', 'free', 'coercion', 'abuse', 'reflect', 'understanding', 'conversion', 'therapy', 'cause', 'devastating', 'harm', 'contribute', 'depression', 'anxiety', 'homelessness', 'tragically', 'suicide', 'study', 'lgbtq', 'youth', 'undergone', 'conversion', 'therapy', 'attempt', 'suicide', 'previous', 'month', 'stark', 'reminder', 'irreversible', 'damage', 'practice', 'cause', 'accord', 'trevor', 'project', 'nearly', 'lgbtq', 'young', 'people', 'say', 'mental', 'health', 'poor', 'time', 'anti', 'lgbtq', 'policy', 'legislation', 'include', 'conversion', 'therapy', 'legal', 'challenge', 'missouri', 'attorney', 'general', 'devastating', 'consequence', 'lgbtq', 'youth', 'high', 'risk', 'mental', 'health', 'struggle', 'violence', 'expert', 'agree', 'help', 'individual', 'conversion', 'therapy', 'compound', 'emotional', 'psychological', 'trauma', 'face', 'lgbtq', 'people', 'particularly', 'young', 'people', 'find', 'identity', 'face', 'effort', 'roll', 'protection', 'community', 'stand', 'firm', 'advocate', 'double', 'commitment', 'protect', 'youth', 'ensure', 'harmful', 'practice', 'like', 'conversion', 'therapy', 'place', 'missouri', 'fight', 'city', 'county', 'right', 'lgbtq', 'people', 'live', 'fear', 'harm', 'discrimination', 'community', 'response', 'swift', 'resolute', 'allow', 'youth', 'subject', 'abuse', 'continue', 'fight', 'safety', 'dignity', 'horn', 'state', 'movement', 'end', 'conversion', 'therapy', 'gain', 'momentum', 'country', 'state', 'pass', 'law', 'protect', 'lgbtq', 'youth', 'discredit', 'practice', 'missouri', 'lawsuit', 'serve', 'stark', 'reminder', 'fight', 'lgbtq', 'right', 'ongoing', 'progress', 'fiercely', 'defend', 'case', 'unfold', 'lgbtq', 'community', 'remain', 'united', 'commitment', 'ensure', 'future', 'individual', 'regardless', 'sexual', 'orientation', 'gender', 'identity', 'live', 'truth', 'fear', 'rejection', 'harm', 'violence']",

the ruling comes nearly two years after a then 16-year-old undergoing a gender transition filed a petition to change his name to better fit his gender identity. both of the teen’s parents consented to the name change. but hinds county chancery judge tametrice hodges in november 2023 denied the petition, citing the teen’s lack of maturity.

the mississippi supreme court voted 8-1 to uphold the ruling.

“the petitioner’s primary appellate argument is that the chancellor had no discretion to deny the name-change petition because it was uncontested and both parents agreed,” the majority opinion reads. “but mississippi law says otherwise.” 

presiding justice leslie king was the sole dissenting vote. he wrote that the record in the case is deficient, leaving it unable for the supreme court to decide whether the lower court was wrong to dismiss the petition. “i find that the chancery court’s order should be vacated and that the case should be remanded,” king said in his dissent.

the initial petition was filed by the teen’s mother in july 2023. she sought to change her child’s first, middle and last names. she requested to change the first name to a more masculine name, the middle name to her own middle name and the last name to the father’s last name only — the last name is currently hyphenated.","['mississippi', 'supreme', 'court', 'thursday', 'uphold', 'ruling', 'deny', 'transgender', 'teen', 'change', 'petition', 'ruling', 'come', 'nearly', 'year', 'year', 'old', 'undergo', 'gender', 'transition', 'file', 'petition', 'change', 'well', 'fit', 'gender', 'identity', 'teen', 'parent', 'consent', 'change', 'hind', 'county', 'chancery', 'judge', 'tametrice', 'hodge', 'november', 'deny', 'petition', 'cite', 'teen', 'lack', 'maturity', 'mississippi', 'supreme', 'court', 'vote', 'uphold', 'ruling', 'petitioner', 'primary', 'appellate', 'argument', 'chancellor', 'discretion', 'deny', 'change', 'petition', 'uncontested', 'parent', 'agree', 'majority', 'opinion', 'read', 'mississippi', 'law', 'say', 'preside', 'justice', 'leslie', 'king', 'sole', 'dissent', 'vote', 'write', 'record', 'case', 'deficient', 'leave', 'unable', 'supreme', 'court', 'decide', 'low', 'court', 'wrong', 'dismiss', 'petition', 'find', 'chancery', 'court', 'order', 'vacate', 'case', 'remand', 'king', 'say', 'dissent', 'initial', 'petition', 'file', 'teen', 'mother', 'july', 'seek', 'change', 'child', 'middle', 'name', 'request', 'change', 'masculine', 'middle', 'middle', 'father', 'currently', 'hyphenate']",

while britain’s highest court said there was no clear winner in its ruling defining a woman for anti-discrimination purposes as someone born biologically female, noting that transgender people remain protected from discrimination, trans groups said the decision would undermine their rights.

equality commission chairwoman kishwer falkner said the “enormously consequential” ruling brought clarity and would prompt her organization to update public codes by summer to comply.

“single-sex services like changing rooms must be based on biological sex,” she told the bbc. “if a male person is allowed to use a women-only service or facility, it isn’t any longer single-sex, then it becomes a mixed-sex space.”


court challenge arose from public board quota
the ruling wednesday came in a case that had nothing to do with those spaces, but stemmed from a 2018 law passed by the scottish parliament that required at least 50% women on boards of scottish public bodies. transgender women with gender recognition certificates were to be included in meeting the quota.

but the court said that using a certificate to interpret someone’s sex would clash with definitions of man and woman and, therefore, the anti-discrimination provisions of the 2010 equality act could “only be interpreted as referring to biological sex.”

out of some 66 million people in england, scotland and wales, about 116,000 identified as trans in the latest census count. about 8,500 gender recognition certificates have been issued.

the feminist group that brought the court case said the outcome provided common sense, protected same-sex spaces for women and brought clarity to the thorny issue. but trans groups said it had caused fear and uncertainty. trans support services overwhelmed
trans activist jane fae, a director of the group transactual, said she worried the ruling would mean “total exclusion and segregation” of trans women.

“no trans women in women’s changing rooms, no trans women in women’s loos, no trans women in women’s sports,” fae said.

“the number of people i have come across on social platforms, on forums, etc., saying ‘how do i go on? i am in tears, i’m in pieces. i am shattered. i am broken,’” fae said. “that seems to be pretty much a unanimous reaction.”

gendered intelligence, a charity dedicated to understanding gender diversity and improving trans lives, said its support services had been overwhelmed with calls from people worried about whether they’d be able to return to their soccer team next week, receive medical care or get support for domestic violence.

“the fear and the despair is very, very real,” said spokesperson cleo madeleine. “and in all of this talk of whether or not people are going to be excluded, whether or not people are going to be banned, there’s been no real sense of what we’re supposed to do if we are.”

falkner noted that there was no law requiring single-sex spaces and she encouraged trans groups to advocate for neutral spaces such as unisex toilets or changing rooms. divisive issue in the culture wars
gender identity has not been as divisive in the u.k. as the u.s., where it has created political firestorms in some states, but the topic factors into britain’s own culture wars.

newspapers have reported on a group of female nurses who sued their employer after they had to share a changing room with a male colleague who identifies as female, and about a nurse who was suspended for calling a transgender pedophile “mister.”

chris evans, editor of the telegraph, a politically conservative london newspaper, said in its morning newsletter thursday that the court had “declared that transgender women are not legally women,” and said it was looking into what the ruling means for “public bodies who have sacrificed women’s rights on the altar of inclusivity.”

british transport police announced it was reviewing its policies in light of the ruling and would temporarily change the way it conducts strip searches of transgender people in custody by assigning an officer of the same biological birth sex. uncertainty over what comes next for trans people
falkner said her group would continue to defend the rights of trans people.

“they have rights, and their rights must be respected,” she said. “it’s not a victory for an increase in unpleasant actions against trans people. we will not tolerate that.”

but madeleine said that falkner had provided no sense of what the future holds for vulnerable people who may find themselves shut out of sports, counseling services and health care.

“my concern is that if the equalities minister does push for transgender people to be shut out from these spaces, as they say, there’s going to be nowhere else for them to go,” madeleine said. “the message we’re getting, frankly, from the highest equalities office in the country is that they want to get rid of us, and they don’t really care where we go.”","['transgender', 'woman', 'exclude', 'woman', 'toilet', 'hospital', 'ward', 'sport', 'team', 'supreme', 'court', 'ruling', 'head', 'equality', 'human', 'right', 'commission', 'say', 'thursday', 'trans', 'group', 'digest', 'judgment', 'broad', 'detrimental', 'impact', 'daily', 'life', 'britain', 'high', 'court', 'say', 'clear', 'winner', 'ruling', 'define', 'woman', 'anti', 'discrimination', 'purpose', 'bear', 'biologically', 'female', 'note', 'transgender', 'people', 'remain', 'protect', 'discrimination', 'trans', 'group', 'say', 'decision', 'undermine', 'right', 'equality', 'commission', 'chairwoman', 'kishwer', 'falkner', 'say', 'enormously', 'consequential', 'ruling', 'bring', 'clarity', 'prompt', 'organization', 'update', 'public', 'code', 'summer', 'comply', 'single', 'sex', 'service', 'like', 'change', 'room', 'base', 'biological', 'sex', 'tell', 'bbc', 'male', 'person', 'allow', 'use', 'woman', 'service', 'facility', 'long', 'single', 'sex', 'mixed', 'sex', 'space', 'court', 'challenge', 'arise', 'public', 'board', 'quota', 'ruling', 'wednesday', 'come', 'case', 'space', 'stem', 'law', 'pass', 'scottish', 'parliament', 'require', 'woman', 'board', 'scottish', 'public', 'body', 'transgender', 'woman', 'gender', 'recognition', 'certificate', 'include', 'meet', 'quota', 'court', 'say', 'certificate', 'interpret', 'sex', 'clash', 'definition', 'man', 'woman', 'anti', 'discrimination', 'provision', 'equality', 'act', 'interpret', 'refer', 'biological', 'sex', 'million', 'people', 'england', 'scotland', 'wale', 'identify', 'tran', 'late', 'census', 'count', 'gender', 'recognition', 'certificate', 'issue', 'feminist', 'group', 'bring', 'court', 'case', 'say', 'outcome', 'provide', 'common', 'sense', 'protect', 'sex', 'space', 'woman', 'bring', 'clarity', 'thorny', 'issue', 'trans', 'group', 'say', 'cause', 'fear', 'uncertainty', 'trans', 'support', 'service', 'overwhelm', 'trans', 'activist', 'jane', 'fae', 'director', 'group', 'transactual', 'say', 'worry', 'ruling', 'mean', 'total', 'exclusion', 'segregation', 'trans', 'woman', 'trans', 'woman', 'woman', 'change', 'room', 'trans', 'woman', 'woman', 'loo', 'trans', 'woman', 'woman', 'sport', 'fae', 'say', 'number', 'people', 'come', 'social', 'platform', 'forum', 'etc', 'say', 'tear', 'piece', 'shatter', 'break', 'fae', 'say', 'pretty', 'unanimous', 'reaction', 'gendere', 'intelligence', 'charity', 'dedicate', 'understand', 'gender', 'diversity', 'improve', 'trans', 'life', 'say', 'support', 'service', 'overwhelm', 'call', 'people', 'worried', 'able', 'return', 'soccer', 'team', 'week', 'receive', 'medical', 'care', 'support', 'domestic', 'violence', 'fear', 'despair', 'real', 'say', 'spokesperson', 'cleo', 'madeleine', 'talk', 'people', 'go', 'exclude', 'people', 'go', 'ban', 'real', 'sense', 'suppose', 'falkner', 'note', 'law', 'require', 'single', 'sex', 'space', 'encourage', 'trans', 'group', 'advocate', 'neutral', 'space', 'unisex', 'toilet', 'change', 'room', 'divisive', 'issue', 'culture', 'war', 'gender', 'identity', 'divisive', 'create', 'political', 'firestorm', 'state', 'topic', 'factor', 'britain', 'culture', 'war', 'newspaper', 'report', 'group', 'female', 'nurse', 'sue', 'employer', 'share', 'change', 'room', 'male', 'colleague', 'identify', 'female', 'nurse', 'suspend', 'call', 'transgender', 'pedophile', 'mister', 'chris', 'evans', 'editor', 'telegraph', 'politically', 'conservative', 'london', 'newspaper', 'say', 'morning', 'newsletter', 'thursday', 'court', 'declare', 'transgender', 'woman', 'legally', 'woman', 'say', 'look', 'ruling', 'mean', 'public', 'body', 'sacrifice', 'woman', 'right', 'altar', 'inclusivity', 'british', 'transport', 'police', 'announce', 'review', 'policy', 'light', 'ruling', 'temporarily', 'change', 'way', 'conduct', 'strip', 'search', 'transgender', 'people', 'custody', 'assign', 'officer', 'biological', 'birth', 'sex', 'uncertainty', 'come', 'tran', 'people', 'falkner', 'say', 'group', 'continue', 'defend', 'right', 'tran', 'people', 'right', 'right', 'respect', 'say', 'victory', 'increase', 'unpleasant', 'action', 'trans', 'people', 'tolerate', 'madeleine', 'say', 'falkner', 'provide', 'sense', 'future', 'hold', 'vulnerable', 'people', 'find', 'shut', 'sport', 'counseling', 'service', 'health', 'care', 'concern', 'equality', 'minister', 'push', 'transgender', 'people', 'shut', 'space', 'go', 'madeleine', 'say', 'message', 'get', 'frankly', 'high', 'equality', 'office', 'country', 'want', 'rid', 'care']",

maine officials have refused to agree with a settlement that would have banned transgender students from sports, arguing that the law does not prevent schools from letting transgender athletes participate. mills said wednesday that the lawsuit was expected and is part of a pressure campaign by washington to force maine to ignore its own human rights laws. “this matter has never been about school sports or the protection of women and girls, as has been claimed, it is about states rights and defending the rule of law against a federal government bent on imposing its will, instead of upholding the law,” mills said in a statement.

maine’s attorney general, aaron frey, said wednesday he is confident maine is acting in accordance with state and federal law.

“our position is further bolstered by the complete lack of any legal citation supporting the administration’s position in its own complaint,” he said in a statement. “while the president issued an executive order that reflects his own interpretation of the law, anyone with the most basic understanding of american civics understands the president does not create law nor interpret law. ”

the government’s complaint cites as examples the case of a transgender athlete who in february won first place in pole vault at a maine indoor track and field meet and a transgender athlete who last year began competing in female cross country races in the state and placed first in a girl’s 5k run. the lawsuit reflects a stark philosophical turnabout from the position on gender identity issues taken during democratic administrations.

under president joe biden, the government tried to extend civil rights policies to protect transgender people. in 2016, the justice department, then led by attorney general loretta lynch, sued north carolina over a law that required transgender people to use public restrooms and showers that corresponded the gender on their birth certificate.

trump signed an executive order in february, “keeping men out of women’s sports,” that gave federal agencies wide latitude to ensure entities that receive federal funding abide by title ix in alignment with his administration’s interpretation of “sex” as the gender someone was assigned at birth.

bondi was joined at the news conference by former university of kentucky swimmer riley gaines, who has emerged as a public face of the opposition to transgender athletes. gaines tied with a transgender athlete for fifth place in a 2022 ncaa championship and has testified before lawmakers across the country on the issue. she and others frame the issue as women’s rights. during a february meeting with governors, trump threatened to pull federal funding from maine if the state did not comply with his executive order. mills responded: “we’ll see you in court.”

maine sued the administration this month after the department of agriculture said it was pausing some money for the state’s educational programs because of what the administration contended was maine’s failure to comply with the title ix law. a federal judge on friday ordered the administration to unfreeze funds intended for a maine child nutrition program.

questions over the rights of transgender people have become a major political issue in the past five years.

twenty-six states have laws or policies barring transgender girls from girls school sports. gop-controlled states have also been banning gender-affirming health care for transgender minors and restricting bathroom use in schools and sometimes other public buildings.","['trump', 'department', 'education', 'health', 'human', 'service', 'say', 'maine', 'education', 'agency', 'violate', 'federal', 'title', 'ix', 'antidiscrimination', 'law', 'allow', 'transgender', 'girl', 'participate', 'girl', 'team', 'justice', 'department', 'ask', 'court', 'order', 'state', 'direct', 'school', 'prohibit', 'participation', 'male', 'athletic', 'competition', 'designate', 'female', 'maine', 'official', 'refuse', 'agree', 'settlement', 'ban', 'transgender', 'student', 'sport', 'argue', 'law', 'prevent', 'school', 'let', 'transgender', 'athlete', 'participate', 'mill', 'say', 'wednesday', 'lawsuit', 'expect', 'pressure', 'campaign', 'washington', 'force', 'maine', 'ignore', 'human', 'right', 'law', 'matter', 'school', 'sport', 'protection', 'woman', 'girl', 'claim', 'state', 'right', 'defend', 'rule', 'law', 'federal', 'government', 'bend', 'impose', 'instead', 'uphold', 'law', 'mill', 'say', 'statement', 'maine', 'attorney', 'general', 'aaron', 'frey', 'say', 'wednesday', 'confident', 'maine', 'act', 'accordance', 'state', 'federal', 'law', 'position', 'bolster', 'complete', 'lack', 'legal', 'citation', 'support', 'administration', 'position', 'complaint', 'say', 'statement', 'president', 'issue', 'executive', 'order', 'reflect', 'interpretation', 'law', 'basic', 'understanding', 'american', 'civic', 'understand', 'president', 'create', 'law', 'interpret', 'law', 'government', 'complaint', 'cite', 'example', 'case', 'transgender', 'athlete', 'february', 'win', 'place', 'pole', 'vault', 'maine', 'indoor', 'track', 'field', 'meet', 'transgender', 'athlete', 'year', 'begin', 'compete', 'female', 'cross', 'country', 'race', 'state', 'place', 'girl', 'run', 'lawsuit', 'reflect', 'stark', 'philosophical', 'turnabout', 'position', 'gender', 'identity', 'issue', 'take', 'democratic', 'administration', 'president', 'joe', 'biden', 'government', 'try', 'extend', 'civil', 'right', 'policy', 'protect', 'transgender', 'people', 'justice', 'department', 'lead', 'attorney', 'general', 'loretta', 'lynch', 'sue', 'north', 'carolina', 'law', 'require', 'transgender', 'people', 'use', 'public', 'restroom', 'shower', 'correspond', 'gender', 'birth', 'certificate', 'trump', 'sign', 'executive', 'order', 'february', 'keep', 'man', 'woman', 'sport', 'give', 'federal', 'agency', 'wide', 'latitude', 'ensure', 'entity', 'receive', 'federal', 'funding', 'abide', 'title', 'ix', 'alignment', 'administration', 'interpretation', 'sex', 'gender', 'assign', 'birth', 'bondi', 'join', 'news', 'conference', 'university', 'kentucky', 'swimmer', 'riley', 'gaine', 'emerge', 'public', 'face', 'opposition', 'transgender', 'athlete', 'gaine', 'tie', 'transgender', 'athlete', 'fifth', 'place', 'ncaa', 'championship', 'testify', 'lawmaker', 'country', 'issue', 'frame', 'issue', 'woman', 'right', 'february', 'meeting', 'governor', 'trump', 'threaten', 'pull', 'federal', 'funding', 'maine', 'state', 'comply', 'executive', 'order', 'mill', 'respond', 'court', 'maine', 'sue', 'administration', 'month', 'department', 'agriculture', 'say', 'pause', 'money', 'state', 'educational', 'program', 'administration', 'contend', 'maine', 'failure', 'comply', 'title', 'ix', 'law', 'federal', 'judge', 'friday', 'order', 'administration', 'unfreeze', 'fund', 'intend', 'maine', 'child', 'nutrition', 'program', 'question', 'right', 'transgender', 'people', 'major', 'political', 'issue', 'past', 'year', 'state', 'law', 'policy', 'bar', 'transgender', 'girl', 'girl', 'school', 'sport', 'gop', 'control', 'state', 'ban', 'gender', 'affirm', 'health', 'care', 'transgender', 'minor', 'restrict', 'bathroom', 'use', 'school', 'public', 'building']",

the measure, which republican gov. greg gianforte signed into effect last week, threatened to deprive transgender people of their constitutional right to equal protection under the law, montana district court judge shane vannatta ruled. the law prevents people from using restrooms in public buildings that do not align with the sex they were assigned at birth.

the five people who sued over the law were likely to prevail, vannatta added in his ruling.

the new law “is motivated by animus and supported by no evidence that its restrictions advance its purported purpose to protect women’s safety and privacy,” vannatta wrote.

the judge’s order will be in effect at least until an april 21 hearing on whether it should continue to be blocked while the lawsuit moves ahead. gianforte spokesperson kaitlin price said the governor will defend the law “and the privacy and safety of women and girls.”

“we’re not surprised to see far-left activists run to the courts to stop this common sense law,” price said in an emailed statement. “a man shouldn’t be in a women’s restroom, shouldn’t be in a women’s shower room and shouldn’t be housed in a women’s prison.” the american civil liberties union praised the ruling.

“today’s ruling provides enormous relief to trans montanans across the state. the state’s relentless attacks on trans and two spirit people cannot withstand constitutional scrutiny by the courts,” said a statement by alex rate, aclu of montana’s legal director.


the law passed this year despite opposition from democrats who worried it would complicate daily life for two fellow lawmakers who are transgender and nonbinary. they included rep. zooey zephyr, a missoula democrat who in 2023 was silenced and sanctioned by her republican colleagues for comments she made on the house floor. the law would require public buildings including the state capitol, schools, jails, prisons, libraries and state-funded domestic violence shelters to provide separate spaces for men and women. it defines the sexes based on a person’s chromosomes and reproductive biology, despite a recent state court ruling that declared the definitions unconstitutional.

the order wasn’t unexpected, bill sponsor republican rep. kerri seekins-crowe said in an emailed statement.

“i am thankful that there is a team of montanans devoted to protecting women’s spaces from men who desire to invade them,” said seekins-crowe.

at least a dozen other states already have variations of bathroom bans on the books, many directed at schools. even more states, including montana, have passed laws to ban gender-affirming medical care for transgender children and keep trans girls out of girls sports.

montana’s law allows people to sue a facility if it does not prevent people from using restrooms or changing rooms that do not align with their sex assigned at birth. they can recover nominal damages, generally $1, and the entity could be required to pay the plaintiff’s legal fees.","['judge', 'wednesday', 'temporarily', 'block', 'montana', 'law', 'restrict', 'transgender', 'people', 'use', 'bathroom', 'public', 'building', 'measure', 'republican', 'gov', 'greg', 'gianforte', 'sign', 'effect', 'week', 'threaten', 'deprive', 'transgender', 'people', 'constitutional', 'right', 'equal', 'protection', 'law', 'montana', 'district', 'court', 'judge', 'shane', 'vannatta', 'rule', 'law', 'prevent', 'people', 'restroom', 'public', 'building', 'align', 'sex', 'assign', 'birth', 'people', 'sue', 'law', 'likely', 'prevail', 'vannatta', 'add', 'ruling', 'new', 'law', 'motivate', 'animus', 'support', 'evidence', 'restriction', 'advance', 'purport', 'purpose', 'protect', 'woman', 'safety', 'privacy', 'vannatta', 'write', 'judge', 'order', 'effect', 'april', 'hearing', 'continue', 'block', 'lawsuit', 'move', 'ahead', 'gianforte', 'spokesperson', 'kaitlin', 'price', 'say', 'governor', 'defend', 'law', 'privacy', 'safety', 'woman', 'girl', 'surprised', 'far', 'leave', 'activist', 'run', 'court', 'stop', 'common', 'sense', 'law', 'price', 'say', 'emailed', 'statement', 'man', 'woman', 'restroom', 'woman', 'shower', 'room', 'house', 'woman', 'prison', 'american', 'civil', 'liberties', 'union', 'praise', 'ruling', 'today', 'ruling', 'provide', 'enormous', 'relief', 'trans', 'montanan', 'state', 'state', 'relentless', 'attack', 'trans', 'spirit', 'people', 'withstand', 'constitutional', 'scrutiny', 'court', 'say', 'statement', 'alex', 'rate', 'aclu', 'montana', 'legal', 'director', 'law', 'pass', 'year', 'despite', 'opposition', 'democrat', 'worry', 'complicate', 'daily', 'life', 'fellow', 'lawmaker', 'transgender', 'nonbinary', 'include', 'rep', 'zooey', 'zephyr', 'missoula', 'democrat', 'silence', 'sanction', 'republican', 'colleague', 'comment', 'house', 'floor', 'law', 'require', 'public', 'building', 'include', 'state', 'capitol', 'school', 'jail', 'prison', 'library', 'state', 'fund', 'domestic', 'violence', 'shelter', 'provide', 'separate', 'space', 'man', 'woman', 'define', 'sex', 'base', 'person', 'chromosome', 'reproductive', 'biology', 'despite', 'recent', 'state', 'court', 'ruling', 'declare', 'definition', 'unconstitutional', 'order', 'unexpected', 'bill', 'sponsor', 'republican', 'rep', 'kerri', 'seekins', 'crowe', 'say', 'emailed', 'statement', 'thankful', 'team', 'montanan', 'devote', 'protect', 'woman', 'space', 'man', 'desire', 'invade', 'say', 'seekins', 'crowe', 'dozen', 'state', 'variation', 'bathroom', 'ban', 'book', 'direct', 'school', 'state', 'include', 'montana', 'pass', 'law', 'ban', 'gender', 'affirm', 'medical', 'care', 'transgender', 'child', 'trans', 'girl', 'girl', 'sport', 'montana', 'law', 'allow', 'people', 'sue', 'facility', 'prevent', 'people', 'restroom', 'change', 'room', 'align', 'sex', 'assign', 'birth', 'recover', 'nominal', 'damage', 'generally', 'entity', 'require', 'pay', 'plaintiff', 'legal', 'fee']",

democratic lawmakers on the state assembly’s committee on arts, entertainment, sports and tourism rejected two proposals by republican lawmakers on tuesday after hours of impassioned debate and commentary.

one bill would have required the california interscholastic federation, the governing body for high school sports, to adopt rules banning students whose sex was assigned male at birth from participating on a girls school sports team. the other would have reversed a 2013 law allowing students to participate in sex-segregated school programs, including on sports teams, and use bathrooms and other facilities that align with their gender identity. it would have applied to k-12 and college students.

the hearing came a day after transgender day of visibility, and weeks after democratic gov. gavin newsom angered his political allies when he suggested on his podcast it’s unfair for transgender athletes to participate in girls sports.

democratic assemblymember chris ward, the committee chair who leads the legislative lgbtq+ caucus, said the bills were part of a broader attack on the rights of transgender youth. he said they could also be invasive to cisgender girls who might be asked to prove their sex.


“i don’t think anybody should be gender policing women and girls,” ward said.

but republican assemblymember bill essayli, who authored the bill to reverse the 2013 law, said the proposal was about fairness.

“biology matters,” he said. “sports are one of the places where that reality is most obvious.”

taylor starling, a student-athlete in riverside who says a trans runner took her spot on her high school’s varsity cross country team, said a ban would help ensure female athletes are treated fairly. “why are girls being told that we must sit down and be quiet while boys unfairly get ahead of us in life?” she said.

but lgbtq+ advocates and parents of transgender children urged lawmakers to support trans kids — in sports and beyond.

cati johnson, a parent of a transgender girl in middle school, said it was important to defend the rights and protections of trans kids, such as the ability to use a restroom that aligns with their gender identity.

“the facilities ban really sends the message that she is not welcome as her authentic self,” johnson said of her daughter. “and that’s just not ok.”

there are more than 49,000 trans youth aged 13 to 17 in california, according to an estimate from the williams institute, a group at the ucla school of law that researches lgbtq+ issues.

“while we know of a few high-profile stories of trans girls who play on teams, we are not seeing evidence that their participation is unfair or harmful,” said elana redfield, the group’s federal policy director. “mostly, these laws appear to be motivated by anti-transgender bias.” at least 24 states have laws on the books barring transgender women and girls from participating in certain women’s or girls sports competitions. judges have temporarily blocked bans in arizona, idaho and utah. in new hampshire and west virginia, students who sued those states over bans were allowed to compete. at the federal level, president donald trump signed an executive order last month aimed at barring transgender athletes from participating in girls and women’s sports.

some states have also imposed bans on gender-affirming care and required schools to share students’ gender identity with parents without the students’ consent.

essayli and other proponents of the proposals referred multiple times to newsom’s comments. the governor later told the los angeles times he had deliberated on the issue for years, and he stuck by his comments.

“i know that hurt a lot of people. but respectfully, i just disagree with those on the other side of this,” he said.

newsom has not directly called for a reversal of existing state law and won’t have to weigh in after the bills died.

education secretary linda mcmahon sent newsom a letter last week, saying his remarks on his podcast caught her attention and requesting he clarify his stance.

“take a stand on your convictions,” she wrote. “be clear about the harms of gender confusion. protect female spaces. do not encourage children to seek permanent medical interventions to their sex. inform parents.”

the u.s. department of education also announced an investigation last week into the state education department over a law banning school districts from requiring teachers and staff to notify parents if a student changes their gender identity at school.","['california', 'lawmaker', 'will', 'change', 'state', 'policy', 'allow', 'transgender', 'kid', 'teen', 'play', 'sport', 'team', 'consistent', 'gender', 'identity', 'amid', 'heated', 'nationwide', 'debate', 'participation', 'trans', 'youth', 'athletic', 'democratic', 'lawmaker', 'state', 'assembly', 'committee', 'art', 'entertainment', 'sport', 'tourism', 'reject', 'proposal', 'republican', 'lawmaker', 'tuesday', 'hour', 'impassione', 'debate', 'commentary', 'bill', 'require', 'california', 'interscholastic', 'federation', 'govern', 'body', 'high', 'school', 'sport', 'adopt', 'rule', 'ban', 'student', 'sex', 'assign', 'male', 'birth', 'participate', 'girl', 'school', 'sport', 'team', 'reverse', 'law', 'allow', 'student', 'participate', 'sex', 'segregated', 'school', 'program', 'include', 'sport', 'team', 'use', 'bathroom', 'facility', 'align', 'gender', 'identity', 'apply', 'college', 'student', 'hearing', 'come', 'day', 'transgender', 'day', 'visibility', 'week', 'democratic', 'gov', 'gavin', 'newsom', 'anger', 'political', 'ally', 'suggest', 'podcast', 'unfair', 'transgender', 'athlete', 'participate', 'girl', 'sport', 'democratic', 'assemblymember', 'chris', 'ward', 'committee', 'chair', 'lead', 'legislative', 'caucus', 'say', 'bill', 'broad', 'attack', 'right', 'transgender', 'youth', 'say', 'invasive', 'cisgender', 'girl', 'ask', 'prove', 'sex', 'think', 'anybody', 'gender', 'police', 'woman', 'girl', 'ward', 'say', 'republican', 'assemblymember', 'bill', 'essayli', 'author', 'bill', 'reverse', 'law', 'say', 'proposal', 'fairness', 'biology', 'matter', 'say', 'sport', 'place', 'reality', 'obvious', 'taylor', 'starling', 'student', 'athlete', 'riverside', 'say', 'trans', 'runner', 'take', 'spot', 'high', 'school', 'varsity', 'cross', 'country', 'team', 'say', 'ban', 'help', 'ensure', 'female', 'athlete', 'treat', 'fairly', 'girl', 'tell', 'sit', 'quiet', 'boy', 'unfairly', 'ahead', 'life', 'say', 'advocate', 'parent', 'transgender', 'child', 'urge', 'lawmaker', 'support', 'trans', 'kid', 'sport', 'cati', 'johnson', 'parent', 'transgend', 'girl', 'middle', 'school', 'say', 'important', 'defend', 'right', 'protection', 'trans', 'kid', 'ability', 'use', 'restroom', 'align', 'gender', 'identity', 'facility', 'ban', 'send', 'message', 'welcome', 'authentic', 'self', 'johnson', 'say', 'daughter', 'ok', 'tran', 'youth', 'age', 'california', 'accord', 'estimate', 'williams', 'institute', 'group', 'ucla', 'school', 'law', 'research', 'issue', 'know', 'high', 'profile', 'story', 'trans', 'girl', 'play', 'team', 'see', 'evidence', 'participation', 'unfair', 'harmful', 'say', 'elana', 'redfield', 'group', 'federal', 'policy', 'director', 'law', 'appear', 'motivate', 'anti', 'transgender', 'bias', 'state', 'law', 'book', 'bar', 'transgender', 'woman', 'girl', 'participate', 'certain', 'woman', 'girl', 'sport', 'competition', 'judge', 'temporarily', 'block', 'ban', 'arizona', 'idaho', 'utah', 'new', 'hampshire', 'west', 'virginia', 'student', 'sue', 'state', 'ban', 'allow', 'compete', 'federal', 'level', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'sign', 'executive', 'order', 'month', 'aim', 'bar', 'transgender', 'athlete', 'participate', 'girl', 'woman', 'sport', 'state', 'impose', 'ban', 'gender', 'affirm', 'care', 'require', 'school', 'share', 'student', 'gender', 'identity', 'parent', 'student', 'consent', 'essayli', 'proponent', 'proposal', 'refer', 'multiple', 'time', 'newsom', 'comment', 'governor', 'later', 'tell', 'los', 'angeles', 'times', 'deliberate', 'issue', 'year', 'stick', 'comment', 'know', 'hurt', 'lot', 'people', 'respectfully', 'disagree', 'say', 'newsom', 'directly', 'call', 'reversal', 'exist', 'state', 'law', 'will', 'weigh', 'bill', 'die', 'education', 'secretary', 'linda', 'mcmahon', 'send', 'newsom', 'letter', 'week', 'say', 'remark', 'podcast', 'catch', 'attention', 'request', 'clarify', 'stance', 'stand', 'conviction', 'write', 'clear', 'harm', 'gender', 'confusion', 'protect', 'female', 'space', 'encourage', 'child', 'seek', 'permanent', 'medical', 'intervention', 'sex', 'inform', 'parent', 'department', 'education', 'announce', 'investigation', 'week', 'state', 'education', 'department', 'law', 'ban', 'school', 'district', 'require', 'teacher', 'staff', 'notify', 'parent', 'student', 'change', 'gender', 'identity', 'school']",

last week the u.s. government terminated at least 68 grants to 46 institutions totaling nearly $40 million when awarded, according to a government website. some of the grant money has already been spent, but at least $1.36 million in future support was yanked as a result of the cuts, a significant undercount because estimates were available for less than a third of grants.

most were in some way related to sexual minorities, including research focused on hiv prevention. other canceled studies centered on cancer, youth suicide and bone health.

health and human services spokesman andrew nixon said the agency is “dedicated to restoring our agencies to their tradition of upholding gold-standard, evidence-based science.” the grants were awarded by the national institutes of health, an agency under hhs. one canceled project at vanderbilt university had been following the overall health of more than 1,200 lgbtq people age 50 and older. most of the money has been spent from the grant funding the project, but it was up for renewal in april, said tara mckay, who leads vanderbilt’s lgbtq+ policy lab. she said the grant won’t be renewed because of the termination, which jeopardizes any long-term results. still, the vanderbilt project had already generated two dozen published papers, including work used to train doctors to provide better care to lgbtq people, increasing the likelihood of cancer screenings and other preventive care.


“that saves us a lot of money in health care and saves lives,” mckay said.

insights from minority populations can increase knowledge that affects everyone, said simon rosser, who studies cancer in gay and bisexual men at the university of minnesota. “we now no longer have anywhere studying lgbt cancer in the united states,” said rosser, who saw his grants canceled on friday.

“when you decide to cancel all the grants on sexual minorities, you really slow down scientific discovery, for everyone,” rosser said. young researchers will lose their jobs, and the field as a whole will suffer, he added.

“it’s a loss of a whole generation of science,” rosser said.

termination letters seen by the associated press gave as reasons that the research was “unscientific” or did “nothing to enhance the health of many americans.”

that language felt personal and stinging, mckay said.

“my project’s been accused of having no benefit to the american people. and, you know, queer and trans folks are americans also,” mckay said.

551d0b0d-de21-4abb-81f6-a55037a04363,pro,denmark advises transgender people to contact us embassy before traveling to the united states,"['denmark', 'advise', 'transgender', 'people', 'contact', 'embassy', 'travel', 'united', 'states']",associated press,none listed,https://apnews.com/article/denmark-us-transgender-travel-advisory-c0b533a72f2b22b438e6a4077889fefb,3/22/2025,"the danish foreign ministry has changed its u.s. travel advisory for transgender people, following other european countries such as germany and finland who suggest they may face difficulties when trying to enter the united states.

the nordic country wrote on its website that transgender people should contact the u.s. embassy before traveling to the united states.

“when applying for an esta or visa to the united states, there are two gender designations to choose from: male or female,” the danish travel advisory stated in an update friday.

“if you have the gender designation x in your passport, or you have changed your gender, it is recommended that you contact the u.s. embassy prior to travel for guidance on how to proceed,” the ministry advised.

while the travel advisory does not explicitly mention the new u.s. administration, it comes only weeks after president donald trump signed an executive order calling for the federal government to define sex as only male or female and for that to be reflected on official documents such as passports and policies such as federal prison assignments.the u.s. state department has stopped issuing travel documents with the “x” gender marker preferred by many nonbinary people, who don’t identify as strictly male or female. the department also stopped allowing people to change the gender listed on their passport or get new ones that reflect their gender rather than their sex assigned at birth. the head of the transgender group lgbt+ denmark, susanne branner, told danish radio radioiii her group had reached out to the country’s foreign ministry earlier in the week and asked for the update of the advisory.


she said there are a few thousand people in denmark who have changed their legal gender and who might encounter unpleasant situations at airports when trying to enter the u.s. or could even be denied entry because their passports do not reflect the gender assigned at birth. “if you are transgender or have an x in your passport, can you risk being denied entry? we would like concrete answers to this,” branner told radioiii.

other european countries have also changed their official advisories for members of the transgender community in a reflection to the situation in the u.s.

the german foreign ministry put out an advisory earlier this month, telling “travelers who have the gender entry ‘x’ or whose current gender entry differs from their gender entry at birth” to contact a u.s. diplomatic mission in germany “before entering the country and find out the applicable entry requirements.”

finland, too, advises prospective u.s. travelers on its foreign ministry homepage that if their “current gender as recorded in their passport differs from the gender they were assigned at birth, u.s. authorities may deny entry. it is recommended that you check with u.s. authorities in advance for entry requirements.”","['danish', 'foreign', 'ministry', 'change', 'travel', 'advisory', 'transgender', 'people', 'follow', 'european', 'country', 'germany', 'finland', 'suggest', 'face', 'difficulty', 'try', 'enter', 'united', 'states', 'nordic', 'country', 'write', 'website', 'transgender', 'people', 'contact', 'embassy', 'travel', 'united', 'states', 'apply', 'esta', 'visa', 'united', 'states', 'gender', 'designation', 'choose', 'male', 'female', 'danish', 'travel', 'advisory', 'state', 'update', 'friday', 'gender', 'designation', 'x', 'passport', 'change', 'gender', 'recommend', 'contact', 'embassy', 'prior', 'travel', 'guidance', 'proceed', 'ministry', 'advise', 'travel', 'advisory', 'explicitly', 'mention', 'new', 'administration', 'come', 'week', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'sign', 'executive', 'order', 'call', 'federal', 'government', 'define', 'sex', 'male', 'female', 'reflect', 'official', 'document', 'passport', 'policy', 'federal', 'prison', 'state', 'department', 'stop', 'issue', 'travel', 'document', 'x', 'gender', 'marker', 'prefer', 'nonbinary', 'people', 'identify', 'strictly', 'male', 'female', 'department', 'stop', 'allow', 'people', 'change', 'gender', 'list', 'passport', 'new', 'one', 'reflect', 'gender', 'sex', 'assign', 'birth', 'head', 'transgender', 'group', 'denmark', 'susanne', 'branner', 'tell', 'danish', 'radio', 'radioiii', 'group', 'reach', 'country', 'foreign', 'ministry', 'early', 'week', 'ask', 'update', 'advisory', 'say', 'thousand', 'people', 'denmark', 'change', 'legal', 'gender', 'encounter', 'unpleasant', 'situation', 'airport', 'try', 'enter', 'deny', 'entry', 'passport', 'reflect', 'gender', 'assign', 'birth', 'transgender', 'x', 'passport', 'risk', 'deny', 'entry', 'like', 'concrete', 'answer', 'branner', 'tell', 'radioiii', 'european', 'country', 'change', 'official', 'advisory', 'member', 'transgender', 'community', 'reflection', 'situation', 'german', 'foreign', 'ministry', 'advisory', 'early', 'month', 'tell', 'traveler', 'gender', 'entry', 'x', 'current', 'gender', 'entry', 'differ', 'gender', 'entry', 'birth', 'contact', 'diplomatic', 'mission', 'germany', 'enter', 'country', 'find', 'applicable', 'entry', 'requirement', 'finland', 'advise', 'prospective', 'traveler', 'foreign', 'ministry', 'homepage', 'current', 'gender', 'record', 'passport', 'differ', 'gender', 'assign', 'birth', 'authority', 'deny', 'entry', 'recommend', 'check', 'authority', 'advance', 'entry', 'requirement']",

republican gov. larry rhoden signed bill hb 1259 into law on friday, which prohibits transgender people from using changing rooms and restrooms that align with their gender identity. the bill also allows people who encounter transgender people in these facilities to seek declaratory and injunctive relief against the school or state if officials did not take reasonable steps to prevent the transgender person from using that facility.

“south dakota is a place where common-sense values remain common,” rhoden said in a statement, adding that the bill promotes “freedom from the ‘woke’ agenda like what has happened in too many other places.”

this is the first time south dakota has had a state law restricting transgender people’s bathroom access, thanks to the overwhelmingly conservative state legislature this session. a bill had previously passed through both chambers of the state legislature in 2016 before it was vetoed by then gov. dennis daugaard. samantha chapman, advocacy manager at the aclu of south dakota, said the organization is exploring its options against the law.

“this is a really painful law,” chapman said. “it’s really disheartening and kind of heartbreaking, frankly, to see rhoden take this position and sign this bill into law.”


south dakota is at least the 13th state to adopt a law barring transgender girls and women from girls and women’s bathrooms at public schools, and in some cases other government facilities. a similar measure was sent thursday to the governor in tennessee; a bill is also on the governor’s desk in montana.

most of the bans in other states face court challenges, but those haven’t had final rulings. courts have struck down some school district-level bathroom bans across the country. but this week, a federal appeals panel ruled 3-0 that a district judge was not wrong to allow idaho’s ban to be enforced while the case is considered. since he returned to office in january, president donald trump has signed a series of executive orders intended to curtail the rights of transgender people. president joe biden’s administration had sought to apply the federal barring of gender discrimination at schools to gender identity, but the courts put the brakes on that.","['new', 'law', 'south', 'dakota', 'restrict', 'transgend', 'people', 'use', 'communal', 'facility', 'public', 'school', 'state', 'own', 'building', 'start', 'july', 'republican', 'gov', 'larry', 'rhoden', 'sign', 'bill', 'hb', 'law', 'friday', 'prohibit', 'transgend', 'people', 'change', 'room', 'restroom', 'align', 'gender', 'identity', 'bill', 'allow', 'people', 'encounter', 'transgender', 'people', 'facility', 'seek', 'declaratory', 'injunctive', 'relief', 'school', 'state', 'official', 'reasonable', 'step', 'prevent', 'transgender', 'person', 'facility', 'south', 'dakota', 'place', 'common', 'sense', 'value', 'remain', 'common', 'rhoden', 'say', 'statement', 'add', 'bill', 'promote', 'freedom', 'woke', 'agenda', 'like', 'happen', 'place', 'time', 'south', 'dakota', 'state', 'law', 'restrict', 'transgender', 'people', 'bathroom', 'access', 'thank', 'overwhelmingly', 'conservative', 'state', 'legislature', 'session', 'bill', 'previously', 'pass', 'chamber', 'state', 'legislature', 'veto', 'gov', 'dennis', 'daugaard', 'samantha', 'chapman', 'advocacy', 'manager', 'aclu', 'south', 'dakota', 'say', 'organization', 'explore', 'option', 'law', 'painful', 'law', 'chapman', 'say', 'disheartening', 'kind', 'heartbreaking', 'frankly', 'rhoden', 'position', 'sign', 'bill', 'law', 'south', 'dakota', 'state', 'adopt', 'law', 'bar', 'transgender', 'girl', 'woman', 'girl', 'woman', 'bathroom', 'public', 'school', 'case', 'government', 'facility', 'similar', 'measure', 'send', 'thursday', 'governor', 'tennessee', 'bill', 'governor', 'desk', 'montana', 'ban', 'state', 'face', 'court', 'challenge', 'final', 'ruling', 'court', 'strike', 'school', 'district', 'level', 'bathroom', 'ban', 'country', 'week', 'federal', 'appeal', 'panel', 'rule', 'district', 'judge', 'wrong', 'allow', 'idaho', 'ban', 'enforce', 'case', 'consider', 'return', 'office', 'january', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'sign', 'series', 'executive', 'order', 'intend', 'curtail', 'right', 'transgender', 'people', 'president', 'joe', 'biden', 'administration', 'seek', 'apply', 'federal', 'barring', 'gender', 'discrimination', 'school', 'gender', 'identity', 'court', 'brake']",

the lawsuit accuses the dodea of eliminating curriculum that deals with subjects such as slavery, native american history, and lgbtq issues, taking books off shelves and canceling events the government says are promoting “gender ideology” or “divisive equity ideology.”  the changes come after president trump signed several executive orders aimed at the military, transgender people, and diversity, equity and inclusion (dei) initiatives. military schools are under the direct control of the administration, which allows for implementation of these changes at a much quicker rate.

“learning is a sacred and foundational right that is now being limited for students in dodea schools. the implementation of these [executive orders], without any due process or parental or professional input, is a violation of our children’s right to access information that prevents them from learning about their own histories, bodies, and identities,” said natalie tolley, a plaintiff on behalf of her three children in the department’s schools.  

“i have three daughters, and they, like all children, deserve access to books that both mirror their own life experiences and that act as windows that expose them to greater diversity. the administration has now made that verboten in dodea schools,” she added. the 12 students, ranging from pre-k to 11th grade, represent six families stationed in virginia, kentucky, italy and japan.

28ad0a61-4b14-4e46-a9aa-ff142b999899,pro,judge rules against parents who wore wristbands to protest transgender student athlete,"['judge', 'rule', 'parent', 'wear', 'wristband', 'protest', 'transgender', 'student', 'athlete']",the hill,brooke migdon,https://thehill.com/homenews/lgbtq/5249752-judge-parents-protest-transgender-student-athlete/,4/15/2025,"a federal judge ruled monday that two fathers cannot wear pink wristbands with two x’s — the symbol for female chromosomes — drawn on them in opposition to a transgender high school athlete on one of their daughters’ rival soccer teams. 

kyle fellers and anthony foote sued administrators at bow high school in south-central new hampshire last year after they were banned from school property for wearing the wristbands to a match against plymouth regional high school, whose girls team includes a transgender player, 16-year-old parker tirrell. they asked a federal district court to allow them to silently wear the wristbands and display signs objecting to trans athletes in girls sports at school events. officials temporarily barred both men from school grounds for distributing and refusing to remove the wristbands during the sept. 17 game between bow and plymouth regional. foote also placed a poster that read “protect women’s sports for female athletes” on his jeep and held the sign up in the parking lot after the game ended. 

according to court documents, fellers and foote previously discussed with other bow parents the possibility of more vocally protesting the match once they learned their daughters would be competing against a transgender girl. 

“the plans discussed reportedly included wearing dresses to the game, buying anti-trans gear, making signs, and generally heckling and intimidating the player,” bow high school athletic director michael desilets wrote in a declaration to the court in october. in the days leading up to the game, fellers, according to court documents, purchased “a large number of pink wristbands” and gave them to foote, who used a black magic marker to adorn each one with either “xx,” the female gender symbol — a circle above a cross — or the acronym “nad,” which foote said meant “not a dude.” 

marcy kelley, superintendent of schools for sau 67, which includes the bow school district, testified during a hearing in november that the “xx” symbol, when used in the context of transgender athletes, “conveys a well-understood anti-trans message.” she noted that riley gaines, a conservative activist who campaigns against the inclusion of transgender athletes in girls and women’s sports, uses the “xx” symbol in her social media posts, clothing line and speaking engagements. according to court filings, fellers and foote often reference gaines in their social media posts and on their signs and posters. 

kelley said she and other school officials believed fellers and foote’s protest targeted a single player, violating the bow high athletic handbook and a school board policy regulating public conduct on school property. tirrell is the only transgender player on plymouth regional high school’s girls soccer team. 

kelley added that she was not troubled by fellers and foote’s opinions on trans athletes but was concerned about protecting an individual student from being the sole subject of a protest. “this was organized and targeted,” she said. 

fellers and foote testified in november that they did not intend to harass or target tirrell. attorneys for the two men avoided describing their actions as “protest,” instead characterizing it as a “passive statement of support for women’s athletics.” but in denying their motion monday, u.s. district court judge steven mcauliffe, an appointee of former president george h.w. bush, said the parents’ “narrow, plausibly inoffensive” intentions cannot be separated from the broader context. he added that adults attending high school events do not enjoy a first amendment protected right to speech that demeans students. 

“the message generally ascribed to the xx symbol, in a context such as that presented here, can reasonably be understood as directly assaulting those who identify as transgender women,” mcauliffe wrote in his ruling. “beyond ‘i oppose your participation,’ the message can reasonably be understood to include assertions that there are ‘only two genders,’ and those who identify as something other than male or female are wrong and their gender identities are false, inauthentic, nonexistent, and not entitled to respect.” 

school authorities, mcauliffe wrote, “were duty bound” to protect tirrell and any transgender students attending the game from “the harassment, intimidation, and anxiety likely to follow” the parents’ actions. del kolde, an attorney for the plaintiffs at the institute for free speech, said the group strongly disagrees with mcauliffe’s ruling. 

“this was adult speech in a limited public forum, which enjoys greater first amendment protection than student speech in the classroom,” kolde said in an email. “bow school district officials were obviously discriminating based on viewpoint because they perceived the xx wristbands to be ‘trans-exclusionary.’ we are still evaluating our options for next steps.” 

new hampshire in july became the first state in the northeast to ban transgender student-athletes from participating on girls and women’s sports teams. in august, a federal judge allowed tirrell and another student, 15-year-old iris turmelle, to continue playing on their respective schools’ girls teams while challenging the ban in court. the same judge, u.s. district court judge landya

5b661c52-c699-4a7a-add7-fa470f716b89,pro,cms tells states medicaid funds cannot be used for gender-affirming care,"['cms', 'tell', 'states', 'medicaid', 'fund', 'gender', 'affirm', 'care']",the hill,alejandra o'connell-domench,https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5245488-gender-affirming-care-medicaid/,4/11/2025,"the centers for medicare and medicaid services (cms) is urging states to not use medicaid funds for gender-affirming care for minors, specifically gender reassignment surgeries or hormone treatments.  

“as a doctor and now cms administrator, my top priority is protecting children and upholding the law,” mehmet oz, the recently confirmed agency head, said in a statement friday.  “medicaid dollars are not to be used for gender reassignment surgeries or hormone treatments in minors—procedures that can cause permanent, irreversible harm, including sterilization,” he continued. “we have a duty to ensure medical care is lawful, necessary, and truly in the best interests of patients.” 

the cms sent a letter to state medicaid agencies friday notifying them of their responsibility to make sure program payments are “consistent with quality of care” and that covered services are in the best interest of the patient.  

the letter, signed by cms deputy administrator and director drew snyder, claims both surgery and hormone treatments lack evidence to support that they offer long-term benefits for transgender minors and that these interventions can cause “long-term and irreparable harm.” it adds that some developed countries like the united kingdom, sweden and finland have issued restrictions on the use of puberty blockers and hormone treatments on children.  

however, every major medical association in the u.s. supports gender-affirming care, including gender reassignment surgery and hormone treatments, for transgender adults and minors. the american medical association also supports public and private health insurance coverage for the gender-affirming care to treat gender dysphoria and opposes the “denial of health insurance based on sexual orientation or gender identity.”  at least 10 states — kentucky, arizona, idaho, missouri, florida, nebraska, ohio, south carolina, tennessee and texas — have introduced legislation to prohibit medicaid coverage of gender-affirming care for adults and minors, according to nonprofit think tank the movement advancement project.","['center', 'medicare', 'medicaid', 'service', 'cms', 'urge', 'state', 'use', 'medicaid', 'fund', 'gender', 'affirm', 'care', 'minor', 'specifically', 'gender', 'reassignment', 'surgery', 'hormone', 'treatment', 'doctor', 'cms', 'administrator', 'priority', 'protect', 'child', 'uphold', 'law', 'mehmet', 'oz', 'recently', 'confirm', 'agency', 'head', 'say', 'statement', 'friday', 'medicaid', 'dollar', 'gender', 'reassignment', 'surgery', 'hormone', 'treatment', 'minor', 'procedure', 'cause', 'permanent', 'irreversible', 'harm', 'include', 'sterilization', 'continue', 'duty', 'ensure', 'medical', 'care', 'lawful', 'necessary', 'truly', 'good', 'interest', 'patient', 'cms', 'send', 'letter', 'state', 'medicaid', 'agency', 'friday', 'notify', 'responsibility', 'sure', 'program', 'payment', 'consistent', 'quality', 'care', 'cover', 'service', 'good', 'interest', 'patient', 'letter', 'sign', 'cms', 'deputy', 'administrator', 'director', 'draw', 'snyder', 'claim', 'surgery', 'hormone', 'treatment', 'lack', 'evidence', 'support', 'offer', 'long', 'term', 'benefit', 'transgender', 'minor', 'intervention', 'cause', 'long', 'term', 'irreparable', 'harm', 'add', 'develop', 'country', 'like', 'united', 'kingdom', 'sweden', 'finland', 'issue', 'restriction', 'use', 'puberty', 'blocker', 'hormone', 'treatment', 'child', 'major', 'medical', 'association', 'support', 'gender', 'affirm', 'care', 'include', 'gender', 'reassignment', 'surgery', 'hormone', 'treatment', 'transgender', 'adult', 'minor', 'american', 'medical', 'association', 'support', 'public', 'private', 'health', 'insurance', 'coverage', 'gender', 'affirm', 'care', 'treat', 'gender', 'dysphoria', 'oppose', 'denial', 'health', 'insurance', 'base', 'sexual', 'orientation', 'gender', 'identity', 'state', 'kentucky', 'arizona', 'idaho', 'missouri', 'florida', 'nebraska', 'ohio', 'south', 'carolina', 'tennessee', 'texas', 'introduce', 'legislation', 'prohibit', 'medicaid', 'coverage', 'gender', 'affirm', 'care', 'adult', 'minor', 'accord', 'nonprofit', 'think', 'tank', 'movement', 'advancement', 'project']",
3579fe17-613f-4dd6-b4ee-e075b0482c78,pro,worldpride organizers caution transgender visitors from abroad,"['worldpride', 'organizer', 'caution', 'transgend', 'visitor', 'abroad']",the hill,brooke migdon,https://thehill.com/homenews/lgbtq/5245215-worldpride-lgbtq-transgender-travel/,4/11/2025,"organizers of worldpride, a global lgbtq pride event series to be held this year in washington, issued an advisory friday for transgender people from overseas, citing recent policies put forward by the trump administration. 

the capital pride alliance, a washington-based lgbtq nonprofit, said in an emailed statement that international travelers to the u.s. should “understand the advisories that may be issued by their home country.” “we recommend that travelers considering entry to the united states make an informed decision based on the potential risks involved, as we, alongside advocates and partner organizations, continue to actively navigate the measures being put in place by the current federal administration,” the group said friday, adding, “traveling with caution and educating ourselves is regular practice for lgbtq+ people.”

international travelers are already facing heightened difficulties entering and leaving the country, said ashley smith, capitol pride alliance’s board president, and some transgender people from abroad are wary of visiting the u.s. with passports or other identity documents that do not match their sex at birth. 

the state department in january suspended a policy allowing trans, nonbinary and intersex americans to update the sex designations on their passports, causing confusion and concern about whether it is safe for them to travel overseas. the department previously allowed u.s. passport holders to self-select their sex designations, including an “unspecified” gender marker denoted by the letter x.  the new policy stems from president trump’s jan. 20 executive order declaring the u.s. recognizes only two sexes, male and female. 

officials in denmark and finland last month advised transgender and gender-nonconforming citizens to practice caution when traveling to the u.s., and trans people across the nation — including the actress hunter schafer — have shared on social media stories of their passports being involuntarily updated to reflect their sex at birth, rather than their gender identity
seven transgender and nonbinary americans are challenging the new policy in federal court, arguing it is motivated by “impermissible animus.” capital pride alliance’s travel advisory friday said the new state department policy “could impact some transgender and nonbinary travelers, so we encourage all visitors to consult official sources and seek legal guidance as needed.” 

smith said worldpride organizers are addressing visitors’ concerns as they come. 

“we’re communicating as best as possible about the different safety measures,” he said. “we’re talking consistently, and we’re having meetings nearly every single day, all day long, to go through this as well as so many other things.” council of governors vice chair charles allen said he attributes any decline in international travelers to the celebrations next month in washington “completely to the change in administration.” 

potential warnings to visitors from abroad, he said, “have nothing to do with the local communities, the state communities, the county communities, and fall squarely with the incredibly shameful tactics we’ve seen in language from the federal administration.” 

allen added that he was “deeply disappointed” by reports that corporate sponsors had backed away from worldpride since president trump’s return to office in january. “it can’t be lost on us that fear is used as a weapon,” he said. worldpride organizers have said they expect roughly 2 million people to attend the event, which will run between may 17 and june 8 in washington.","['organizer', 'worldpride', 'global', 'lgbtq', 'pride', 'event', 'series', 'hold', 'year', 'washington', 'issue', 'advisory', 'friday', 'transgender', 'people', 'overseas', 'cite', 'recent', 'policy', 'forward', 'trump', 'administration', 'capital', 'pride', 'alliance', 'washington', 'base', 'lgbtq', 'nonprofit', 'say', 'emailed', 'statement', 'international', 'traveler', 'understand', 'advisory', 'issue', 'home', 'country', 'recommend', 'traveler', 'consider', 'entry', 'united', 'states', 'informed', 'decision', 'base', 'potential', 'risk', 'involve', 'alongside', 'advocate', 'partner', 'organization', 'continue', 'actively', 'navigate', 'measure', 'place', 'current', 'federal', 'administration', 'group', 'say', 'friday', 'add', 'travel', 'caution', 'educate', 'regular', 'practice', 'people', 'international', 'traveler', 'face', 'heighten', 'difficulty', 'enter', 'leave', 'country', 'say', 'ashley', 'smith', 'capitol', 'pride', 'alliance', 'board', 'president', 'transgender', 'people', 'abroad', 'wary', 'visit', 'passport', 'identity', 'document', 'match', 'sex', 'birth', 'state', 'department', 'january', 'suspend', 'policy', 'allow', 'trans', 'nonbinary', 'intersex', 'americans', 'update', 'sex', 'designation', 'passport', 'cause', 'confusion', 'concern', 'safe', 'travel', 'overseas', 'department', 'previously', 'allow', 'passport', 'holder', 'self', 'select', 'sex', 'designation', 'include', 'unspecified', 'gender', 'marker', 'denote', 'letter', 'new', 'policy', 'stem', 'president', 'trump', 'jan', 'executive', 'order', 'declare', 'recognize', 'sex', 'male', 'female', 'official', 'denmark', 'finland', 'month', 'advise', 'transgender', 'gender', 'nonconforme', 'citizen', 'practice', 'caution', 'travel', 'tran', 'people', 'nation', 'include', 'actress', 'hunter', 'schafer', 'share', 'social', 'medium', 'story', 'passport', 'involuntarily', 'update', 'reflect', 'sex', 'birth', 'gender', 'identity', 'seven', 'transgender', 'nonbinary', 'americans', 'challenge', 'new', 'policy', 'federal', 'court', 'argue', 'motivate', 'impermissible', 'animus', 'capital', 'pride', 'alliance', 'travel', 'advisory', 'friday', 'say', 'new', 'state', 'department', 'policy', 'impact', 'transgender', 'nonbinary', 'traveler', 'encourage', 'visitor', 'consult', 'official', 'source', 'seek', 'legal', 'guidance', 'need', 'smith', 'say', 'worldpride', 'organizer', 'address', 'visitor', 'concern', 'come', 'communicate', 'well', 'possible', 'different', 'safety', 'measure', 'say', 'talk', 'consistently', 'have', 'meeting', 'nearly', 'single', 'day', 'day', 'long', 'thing', 'council', 'governor', 'vice', 'chair', 'charles', 'allen', 'say', 'attribute', 'decline', 'international', 'traveler', 'celebration', 'month', 'washington', 'completely', 'change', 'administration', 'potential', 'warning', 'visitor', 'abroad', 'say', 'local', 'community', 'state', 'community', 'county', 'community', 'fall', 'squarely', 'incredibly', 'shameful', 'tactic', 'see', 'language', 'federal', 'administration', 'allen', 'add', 'deeply', 'disappointed', 'report', 'corporate', 'sponsor', 'back', 'away', 'worldpride', 'president', 'trump', 'return', 'office', 'january', 'lose', 'fear', 'weapon', 'say', 'worldpride', 'organizer', 'say', 'expect', 'roughly', 'million', 'people', 'attend', 'event', 'run', 'june', 'washington']",

jo ellis, a pilot in the virginia national guard, filed the defamation suit against matt wallace, a cryptocurrency investor and influencer on the social platform x. in january, wallace falsely claimed on his x account, where he has 2.2 million followers, that ellis had been operating the black hawk helicopter that collided with a passenger jet on jan. 29. all 67 people aboard the two aircraft were killed in the crash, the deadliest u.s. aviation disaster in more than 20 years. 

on jan. 30, less than 24 hours after the crash, wallace shared a post from one of his alternative accounts that claimed the helicopter pilot was transgender. the post, which wallace later deleted, included a photo of ellis, according to the lawsuit. 

wallace made two additional posts linking ellis to the crash, according to the lawsuit, including one that referenced a jan. 29 podcast interview where ellis discussed president trump’s executive order to bar transgender people from serving openly in the military. 

on jan. 31, after learning from friends that she had been falsely connected to the crash, ellis filmed and uploaded a “proof of life” video to her personal facebook page. 

“i understand some people have associated me with the crash in d.c., and that is false,” ellis said in the video. “it is insulting to the families to try to tie this to some sort of political agenda, they don’t deserve that. i don’t deserve this, and i hope that y’all know that i’m alive and well and this should be sufficient for you all to end all the rumors.” wallace then distanced himself from the claim, according to wednesday’s lawsuit. he said another account had started the rumor that ellis had been involved in the crash and that the post “seemed credible” because ellis “wrote an article calling out trump’s trans military ban only a few days ago.” ellis, backed by equality legal action fund, an lgbtq legal organization, argued on wednesday that wallace’s claims “are outright and unequivocal falsehoods.”

her lawsuit, filed in the u.s. district court for the district of colorado, where wallace resides, claims he used his platform “to monetize a false narrative that [ellis] was not only one of the army pilots involved in the mid-air collision, but also that she engaged in ‘another trans terror attack’ and intentionally caused the mid-air collision due to her ‘depression’ and ‘gender dysphoria.’” 

far-right social media personalities and conservative provocateurs in recent years have been quick to claim, often without evidence, that transgender people are to blame for devastating acts of violence, including mass shootings at a texas elementary school, celebrity pastor joel osteen’s megachurch and a high school in suburban iowa. 

in december, former rep. matt gaetz (r-fla.) falsely suggested a transgender student carried out a shooting at a wisconsin private school, and tech billionaire elon musk, the owner of the social platform x and a close ally of president trump, wrote in a recent social media post, “the probability of a trans person being violent appears to be vastly higher than non-trans.” 

in the immediate aftermath of the jan. 29 collision, trump said diversity initiatives at the federal aviation administration may be to blame.","['transgender', 'military', 'helicopter', 'pilot', 'sue', 'conservative', 'social', 'media', 'influencer', 'alleged', 'defamation', 'wednesday', 'month', 'falsely', 'blame', 'deadly', 'midair', 'collision', 'potomac', 'river', 'washington', 'jo', 'ellis', 'pilot', 'virginia', 'national', 'guard', 'file', 'defamation', 'suit', 'matt', 'wallace', 'cryptocurrency', 'investor', 'influencer', 'social', 'platform', 'january', 'wallace', 'falsely', 'claim', 'x', 'account', 'million', 'follower', 'ellis', 'operate', 'black', 'hawk', 'helicopter', 'collide', 'passenger', 'jet', 'jan', 'people', 'aboard', 'aircraft', 'kill', 'crash', 'deadly', 'aviation', 'disaster', 'year', 'jan', 'hour', 'crash', 'wallace', 'share', 'post', 'alternative', 'account', 'claim', 'helicopter', 'pilot', 'transgender', 'post', 'wallace', 'later', 'delete', 'include', 'photo', 'ellis', 'accord', 'lawsuit', 'wallace', 'additional', 'post', 'link', 'ellis', 'crash', 'accord', 'lawsuit', 'include', 'reference', 'jan', 'podcast', 'interview', 'ellis', 'discuss', 'president', 'trump', 'executive', 'order', 'bar', 'transgender', 'people', 'serve', 'openly', 'military', 'jan', 'learn', 'friend', 'falsely', 'connect', 'crash', 'ellis', 'film', 'upload', 'proof', 'life', 'video', 'personal', 'facebook', 'page', 'understand', 'people', 'associate', 'crash', 'false', 'ellis', 'say', 'video', 'insulting', 'family', 'try', 'tie', 'sort', 'political', 'agenda', 'deserve', 'deserve', 'hope', 'know', 'alive', 'sufficient', 'end', 'rumor', 'wallace', 'distance', 'claim', 'accord', 'wednesday', 'lawsuit', 'say', 'account', 'start', 'rumor', 'ellis', 'involve', 'crash', 'post', 'credible', 'ellis', 'write', 'article', 'call', 'trump', 'trans', 'military', 'ban', 'day', 'ago', 'ellis', 'back', 'equality', 'legal', 'action', 'fund', 'lgbtq', 'legal', 'organization', 'argue', 'wednesday', 'wallace', 'claim', 'outright', 'unequivocal', 'falsehood', 'lawsuit', 'file', 'district', 'court', 'district', 'colorado', 'wallace', 'reside', 'claim', 'platform', 'monetize', 'false', 'narrative', 'ellis', 'army', 'pilot', 'involve', 'mid', 'air', 'collision', 'engage', 'trans', 'terror', 'attack', 'intentionally', 'cause', 'mid', 'air', 'collision', 'depression', 'gender', 'dysphoria', 'far', 'right', 'social', 'medium', 'personality', 'conservative', 'provocateur', 'recent', 'year', 'quick', 'claim', 'evidence', 'transgender', 'people', 'blame', 'devastating', 'act', 'violence', 'include', 'mass', 'shooting', 'texas', 'elementary', 'school', 'celebrity', 'pastor', 'joel', 'osteen', 'megachurch', 'high', 'school', 'suburban', 'iowa', 'december', 'rep', 'matt', 'gaetz', 'r', 'fla', 'falsely', 'suggest', 'transgender', 'student', 'carry', 'shooting', 'wisconsin', 'private', 'school', 'tech', 'billionaire', 'elon', 'musk', 'owner', 'social', 'platform', 'x', 'close', 'ally', 'president', 'trump', 'write', 'recent', 'social', 'medium', 'post', 'probability', 'trans', 'person', 'violent', 'appear', 'vastly', 'high', 'non', 'trans', 'immediate', 'aftermath', 'jan', 'collision', 'trump', 'say', 'diversity', 'initiative', 'federal', 'aviation', 'administration', 'blame']",

students and teachers were caught off guard on march 19 when attendance was called and they realized preferred names were changed in the district’s system, which is called infinite campus. “he found out about the rescinded name change policy at school,” said a parent with a transgender son. “his fourth-period teacher advised him to go to the office because his preferred name was not listed in infinite campus. my son started to go to the office and in a panic ran to the bathroom to call me at work.”

izetta thomas, the lead organizer with the columbus education justice coalition, said she has been talking to parents and students since the day of the change.

“to have that happen on such a grand scale and to not even see it coming, i don’t think that there are any words to describe the feelings that folks had when that happened,” she said.
thomas added, “those names that were in the system were actually there with parent consent and permission because there was a form that parents had to fill out for that change to even be in the system at all.”

she also said she feels uncomfortable sending her son back to class. “my son has not physically been back to school since march 19,” the parent said. “for his safety, we unenrolled from his previous school. now, his educational opportunities have been taken from him.”

columbus schools superintendent angela chapman sent out a letter to students, parents and staff on friday acknowledging that no warning was given. in the letter, chapman said in part, “we did not provide prior notice this was occurring, nor did we ensure support was in place to prioritize the emotional well-being of everyone impacted.”

chapman also apologized for how the district handled this situation.

the letter cited recent ohio laws — including a school bathroom bill and the parents’ bill of rights — as reasons for the change, but thomas said that none of those laws require school districts to revert trans students’ names. “a lot of the information that we’ve been getting from folks at the district is that it was anticipatory,” thomas said. “an apology is not enough. an apology is not accountability, and that’s what we’re looking for, is accountability.” the parent did say chapman called them personally to apologize, but they said she offered little in the way of a solution.

georgia’s senate bill 1 would require middle schools, high schools and colleges to restrict participation in sports and access to multioccupancy facilities like restrooms and locker rooms on the basis of students’ “reproductive biology and genetics at birth.” it employs narrow definitions of male and female that are based on an individual’s capability to produce either “human sperm” or “human ovum.”  also known as the “riley gaines act,” named after the conservative activist who regularly campaigns against the inclusion of transgender girls in sports, the bill easily cleared both chambers of the state legislature with support from republicans and democrats. 

“such a tremendous honor. there are few causes more worthy than protecting opportunities for the next generation,” riley gaines wrote on the social platform x after georgia state house lawmakers passed the bill monday. the lower chamber passed the measure in a 100-64 vote, with three democrats voting with all republicans to send it to kemp’s desk. 

another “riley gaines act” applying rigid definitions of male and female in state code became law this month in west virginia. 

in a statement on monday, georgia house speaker jon burns (r) said the legislature in passing the bill “sent a clear message — biological men are not welcome in girls’ sports or spaces here in georgia.” the state’s lt. gov. burt jones (r) called the measure’s success in the general assembly “a historic step toward achieving a critical goal for this session.” 

jones, along with gaines, attended a signing ceremony in washington in february for one of president trump’s executive orders to ban transgender athletes from girls’ and women’s sports. 

georgia’s state legislature, which is controlled predominantly by republicans, in 2022 adopted a similar law creating a commission with the authority to ban transgender athletes from competing on sports teams that match their gender identity. the georgia high school association, the state’s governing body for high school sports, passed a rule the same year mandating students’ participation in athletics will be determined by their original birth certificate. 

lgbtq and civil rights groups have largely opposed efforts to restrict or ban transgender athletes from participating on sports teams that best align with their gender identity, alleging they discriminate against trans young people and open the door to abuse. in january, house democrats dubbed a gop-backed measure to ban trans athletes from girls’ and women’s athletics nationwide the “child predator empowerment act.” 

at least 25 states since 2020 have enacted laws barring transgender athletes from competing on teams that match their gender identity. four of those laws — in idaho, west virginia, utah and arizona — are blocked by federal court orders.","['georgia', 'lawmakers', 'monday', 'send', 'legislation', 'bar', 'transgender', 'student', 'athlete', 'participate', 'girl', 'woman', 'sport', 'republican', 'gov', 'brian', 'kemp', 'expect', 'sign', 'measure', 'law', 'georgia', 'senate', 'bill', 'require', 'middle', 'school', 'high', 'school', 'college', 'restrict', 'participation', 'sport', 'access', 'multioccupancy', 'facility', 'like', 'restroom', 'locker', 'room', 'basis', 'student', 'reproductive', 'biology', 'genetic', 'birth', 'employ', 'narrow', 'definition', 'male', 'female', 'base', 'individual', 'capability', 'produce', 'human', 'sperm', 'human', 'ovum', 'know', 'riley', 'gaines', 'act', 'name', 'conservative', 'activist', 'regularly', 'campaign', 'inclusion', 'transgender', 'girl', 'sport', 'bill', 'easily', 'clear', 'chamber', 'state', 'legislature', 'support', 'republicans', 'democrat', 'tremendous', 'honor', 'cause', 'worthy', 'protect', 'opportunity', 'generation', 'riley', 'gaine', 'write', 'social', 'platform', 'x', 'georgia', 'state', 'house', 'lawmaker', 'pass', 'bill', 'monday', 'low', 'chamber', 'pass', 'measure', 'vote', 'democrats', 'vote', 'republicans', 'send', 'kemp', 'desk', 'riley', 'gaines', 'act', 'apply', 'rigid', 'definition', 'male', 'female', 'state', 'code', 'law', 'month', 'west', 'virginia', 'statement', 'monday', 'georgia', 'house', 'speaker', 'jon', 'burns', 'r', 'say', 'legislature', 'pass', 'bill', 'send', 'clear', 'message', 'biological', 'man', 'welcome', 'girl', 'sport', 'space', 'georgia', 'state', 'lt', 'gov', 'burt', 'jones', 'r', 'call', 'measure', 'success', 'general', 'assembly', 'historic', 'step', 'achieve', 'critical', 'goal', 'session', 'jones', 'gaine', 'attend', 'signing', 'ceremony', 'washington', 'february', 'president', 'trump', 'executive', 'order', 'ban', 'transgender', 'athlete', 'girl', 'woman', 'sport', 'georgia', 'state', 'legislature', 'control', 'predominantly', 'republican', 'adopt', 'similar', 'law', 'create', 'commission', 'authority', 'ban', 'transgender', 'athlete', 'compete', 'sport', 'team', 'match', 'gender', 'identity', 'georgia', 'high', 'school', 'association', 'state', 'govern', 'body', 'high', 'school', 'sport', 'pass', 'rule', 'year', 'mandate', 'student', 'participation', 'athletic', 'determine', 'original', 'birth', 'certificate', 'lgbtq', 'civil', 'right', 'group', 'largely', 'oppose', 'effort', 'restrict', 'ban', 'transgender', 'athlete', 'participate', 'sport', 'team', 'good', 'align', 'gender', 'identity', 'allege', 'discriminate', 'trans', 'young', 'people', 'open', 'door', 'abuse', 'january', 'house', 'democrats', 'dub', 'gop', 'back', 'measure', 'ban', 'trans', 'athlete', 'girl', 'woman', 'athletic', 'nationwide', 'child', 'predator', 'empowerment', 'act', 'state', 'enact', 'law', 'bar', 'transgender', 'athlete', 'compete', 'team', 'match', 'gender', 'identity', 'law', 'idaho', 'west', 'virginia', 'utah', 'arizona', 'block', 'federal', 'court', 'order']",

the transgender health care access act, introduced monday by rep. becca balint (d-vt.), would establish grants supporting medical education programs and professional training in transition-related care and expand its access in rural communities. balint introduced the measure on trans day of visibility, recognized annually on march 31 to celebrate the lives and contributions of trans people and draw attention to disproportionate discrimination faced by the community. the bill has nearly 30 democratic co-sponsors, several of whom, including reps. jerry nadler (n.y.) and sara jacobs (calif.), are slated to speak at a transgender rights rally monday evening in washington. 

lgbtq civil rights groups, including the human rights campaign, the national center for lesbian rights, advocates for trans equality and the aclu, are also backing the legislation, according to a news release from balint’s office, though it stands little chance in the gop-controlled congress.

in a statement, balint, one of 14 openly lgbtq lawmakers and a member of the congressional equality caucus, which has also endorsed the bill, said the measure is a response to legislation filed disproportionately by republicans to curb access to care that major medical organizations have said is medically necessary. 

“as republicans use their power to take away health care and continue to attack and dehumanize trans folks, i’m not standing down. that’s why i’m introducing this bill to expand access and train more providers,” she said. 

“republicans are obsessed with attacking trans people. it’s dangerous. over and over again they use messages designed to get americans to fear one another and to divide us,” balint added. “but i want queer and trans americans to know you have fighters and allies in congress.” president trump and his administration have made transgender rights a key target, and half a dozen executive orders signed by the president since his return to office in january directly impact trans americans. a sweeping order trump signed during his first hours back in washington proclaims the government recognizes only two sexes, male and female, and another he signed in february seeks to end federal support for transition-related care for youth. two federal judges blocked the administration from implementing the latter order. 

trump has also endorsed states’ efforts to heavily restrict or ban access to gender-affirming care for minors and called on congress this month during a joint address to pass legislation outlawing such care nationwide. 

federal legislation to ban trans health care for youth has been introduced in each of the last two congresses. the bill’s primary sponsor, rep. marjorie taylor greene (r-ga.), has not refiled the measure in the current congress but has said she plans to do so. the 2023 senate version of greene’s bill, the protect children’s innocence act, was sponsored by now-vice president vance. 

earlier this month, rep. dan crenshaw (r-texas) reintroduced legislation to block hospitals that provide gender-affirming care to minors from being eligible to participate in the children’s hospital graduate medical education payment program, which funds education and training for pediatric medical residents and fellows. he filed the bill on detrans awareness day, which recognizes the experiences of individuals who once, but no longer, identified as trans and advocates against transition-related medical care, particularly for minors.

the letter comes following investigations conducted by the department of education against california and maine over policies the federal agency alleges keep records of students’ gender identity away from their parents, allegedly violating the family educational rights and privacy act (ferpa). ferpa gives parents a legal right to have access to all their children’s educational records.  

“parents are the most natural protectors of their children. yet many states and school districts have enacted policies that imply students need protection from their parents,” mcmahon said.  

“these states and school districts have turned the concept of privacy on its head—prioritizing the privileges of government officials over the rights of parents and wellbeing of families. going forward, the correct application of ferpa will be to empower all parents to protect their children from the radical ideologies that have taken over many schools,” she added.  the “dear colleague” letter from the student privacy policy office also identifies “priority concerns” for which the office is considering “proactive measures” to address.  

the concerns include schools that allegedly have policies that do not allow parents to see if the district comes up with a “gender plan” to support a transgender student and districts that are allegedly not annually notifying parents of their rights under ferpa. the letter and investigations into maine and california over ferpa come as the trump administration has implemented policies affecting transgender students and athletes.  the president signed an executive order barring transgender athletes from competing on the sports team they choose. funding has also been paused to the university of pennsylvania (penn) and the university of maine over alleged violations of that order. 

both schools have said they are following ncaa rules, which were changed to bar transgender athletes after president trump’s order.  

the investigations came after republican backlash to penn over a swimming controversy with a transgender student back in 2022. the university of maine investigation began after a spat between trump and maine’s governor over his order.","['education', 'secretary', 'linda', 'mcmahon', 'send', 'dear', 'colleague', 'letter', 'school', 'friday', 'warning', 'increase', 'enforcement', 'parental', 'right', 'letter', 'come', 'follow', 'investigation', 'conduct', 'department', 'education', 'california', 'maine', 'policy', 'federal', 'agency', 'allege', 'record', 'student', 'gender', 'identity', 'away', 'parent', 'allegedly', 'violate', 'family', 'educational', 'right', 'privacy', 'act', 'ferpa', 'ferpa', 'give', 'parent', 'legal', 'right', 'access', 'child', 'educational', 'record', 'parent', 'natural', 'protector', 'child', 'state', 'school', 'district', 'enact', 'policy', 'imply', 'student', 'need', 'protection', 'parent', 'mcmahon', 'say', 'state', 'school', 'district', 'turn', 'concept', 'privacy', 'head', 'prioritize', 'privilege', 'government', 'official', 'right', 'parent', 'wellbee', 'family', 'go', 'forward', 'correct', 'application', 'ferpa', 'empower', 'parent', 'protect', 'child', 'radical', 'ideology', 'take', 'school', 'add', 'dear', 'colleague', 'letter', 'student', 'privacy', 'policy', 'office', 'identify', 'priority', 'concern', 'office', 'consider', 'proactive', 'measure', 'address', 'concern', 'include', 'school', 'allegedly', 'policy', 'allow', 'parent', 'district', 'come', 'gender', 'plan', 'support', 'transgend', 'student', 'district', 'allegedly', 'annually', 'notify', 'parent', 'right', 'ferpa', 'letter', 'investigation', 'maine', 'california', 'ferpa', 'come', 'trump', 'administration', 'implement', 'policy', 'affect', 'transgender', 'student', 'athlete', 'president', 'sign', 'executive', 'order', 'bar', 'transgender', 'athlete', 'compete', 'sport', 'team', 'choose', 'funding', 'pause', 'university', 'pennsylvania', 'penn', 'university', 'maine', 'allege', 'violation', 'order', 'school', 'say', 'follow', 'ncaa', 'rule', 'change', 'bar', 'transgender', 'athlete', 'president', 'trump', 'order', 'investigation', 'come', 'republican', 'backlash', 'penn', 'swimming', 'controversy', 'transgender', 'student', 'university', 'maine', 'investigation', 'begin', 'spat', 'trump', 'maine', 'governor', 'order']",

the agency referred its title ix investigation into the state’s k-12 transgender student athletics participation policy to the justice department, which is a key step to launching enforcement actions. the education department will also initiate an administrative proceeding to adjudicate the termination of maine’s education agency’s federal k-12 funding, including formula and discretionary grants. “the maine department of education will now have to defend its discriminatory practices before a department administrative law judge and in a federal court against the justice department,” acting assistant secretary for civil rights craig trainor said in a statement. “governor mills would have done well to adhere to the wisdom embedded in the old idiom — be careful what you wish for. now she will see the trump administration in court.”


in february, the agency’s office for civil rights launched a self-initiated investigation into the maine agency for potentially violating title ix after a public spat between president donald trump and maine gov. janet mills.

trump threatened maine’s federal funding and singled out mills, a democrat, and her state’s policies after she refused to say whether she would comply with his executive order barring transgender girls from girls’ sports.

trump has since demanded a “full throated apology” from mills and a promise to never pose a “challenge” to the federal government again.

in march, the education department’s probe found the maine department of education’s sports participation policy violated title ix. but the proposed agreement given to the state to sign to avoid losing its funding went beyond just addressing sports.

the requirements of the agreement would have forced the state to say the trump administration’s interpretation of title ix outweighs maine’s human rights act, which provides protection for transgender people.

the education department’s proposed resolution agreement would have also required the state agency to direct all schools to comply with title ix and specify that the federal law requires schools to “forbid allowing males to participate in any athletic program, or access any locker room or bathroom, designated for females.” the directive must also tell schools there are only two sexes, “woman” and “man.”","['education', 'department', 'launch', 'process', 'pull', 'maine', 'federal', 'funding', 'cite', 'state', 'refusal', 'bar', 'transgender', 'student', 'girl', 'sport', 'agency', 'refer', 'title', 'ix', 'investigation', 'state', 'transgender', 'student', 'athletic', 'participation', 'policy', 'justice', 'department', 'key', 'step', 'launch', 'enforcement', 'action', 'education', 'department', 'initiate', 'administrative', 'proceeding', 'adjudicate', 'termination', 'maine', 'education', 'agency', 'federal', 'funding', 'include', 'formula', 'discretionary', 'grant', 'maine', 'department', 'education', 'defend', 'discriminatory', 'practice', 'department', 'administrative', 'law', 'judge', 'federal', 'court', 'justice', 'department', 'act', 'assistant', 'secretary', 'civil', 'right', 'craig', 'trainor', 'say', 'statement', 'governor', 'mill', 'adhere', 'wisdom', 'embed', 'old', 'idiom', 'careful', 'wish', 'trump', 'administration', 'court', 'february', 'agency', 'office', 'civil', 'right', 'launch', 'self', 'initiate', 'investigation', 'maine', 'agency', 'potentially', 'violate', 'title', 'ix', 'public', 'spat', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'maine', 'gov', 'janet', 'mills', 'trump', 'threaten', 'maine', 'federal', 'funding', 'single', 'mill', 'democrat', 'state', 'policy', 'refuse', 'comply', 'executive', 'order', 'bar', 'transgender', 'girl', 'girl', 'sport', 'trump', 'demand', 'throate', 'apology', 'mill', 'promise', 'pose', 'challenge', 'federal', 'government', 'march', 'education', 'department', 'probe', 'find', 'maine', 'department', 'education', 'sport', 'participation', 'policy', 'violate', 'title', 'ix', 'propose', 'agreement', 'give', 'state', 'sign', 'avoid', 'lose', 'funding', 'go', 'address', 'sport', 'requirement', 'agreement', 'force', 'state', 'trump', 'administration', 'interpretation', 'title', 'ix', 'outweighs', 'maine', 'human', 'right', 'act', 'provide', 'protection', 'transgender', 'people', 'education', 'department', 'propose', 'resolution', 'agreement', 'require', 'state', 'agency', 'direct', 'school', 'comply', 'title', 'ix', 'specify', 'federal', 'law', 'require', 'school', 'forbid', 'allow', 'male', 'participate', 'athletic', 'program', 'access', 'locker', 'room', 'bathroom', 'designate', 'female', 'directive', 'tell', 'school', 'sex', 'woman', 'man']",
a2c81a0e-c0ee-41ae-ac08-0325c4d98892,pro,planned parenthood applies its abortion playbook to push for transgender rights in california,"['plan', 'parenthood', 'apply', 'abortion', 'playbook', 'push', 'transgender', 'right', 'california']",politico,rachel bluth,https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/01/planned-parenthood-push-transgender-rights-california-00265387,4/1/2025,"california reproductive health care advocates are moving to extend their playbook for abortion protections to transgender care in the wake of federal funding cuts and moves to reverse trans rights under the trump administration.

in a state legislative package first shared with politico, planned parenthood is backing six bills that touch on access to medication abortion, sti testing, medi-cal funding and privacy protections for patients and providers who work in gender-affirming care. the package comes just after the trump administration notified planned parenthood clinics that it’s withholding tens of millions of dollars under the title x family planning program and threatens further cuts to other state health resources. president donald trump has also taken aim at transgender care, threatening to cut off medicaid funding to any facility that provides it, especially to minors.


planned parenthood now sees an opening to try to protect gender-affirming care in california, similar to how the state moved to enshrine abortion rights under the first trump administration.

several of the proposals build on shield laws and privacy protections the groups first pushed for to cover abortion providers and patients in the immediate aftermath of the supreme court overturning roe v. wade in 2022.

“plain and simple, we’re protecting our patients and providers,” jodi hicks, ceo of the group’s california advocacy group, told politico. “we’re really looking at everything that we did, what was successful when we were protecting abortion, transferring that over to ensure our trans folks are also protected.”

the legislative package is being rolled out at a critical juncture for planned parenthood. the group is coming under threat at the macro level in washington, where anti-abortion activists have spent the month lobbying congress to defund the organization; and at the micro level in sacramento where social conservatives have spent the past few days advocating against abortion at the march for life and transgender rights at other bill hearings.

one proposal from state sen. scott wiener, which he’s calling the transgender state of refuge, builds on a law he passed in 2022 that prevents law enforcement from accessing some medical records around gender-affirming care.

wiener’s bill this year, sb 497, closes a loophole in the prior bill, now requiring a warrant for law enforcement when they want to access a prescription drug database that could be used to identify transgender men accessing testosterone. the bill also expands the state’s shield laws to prohibit health care providers from complying with subpoenas that require them to disclose medical information about gender-affirming care. it’s similar to two other measures passed in recent years, sb 345 from former state sen. nancy skinner and ab 1666 from assemblymember rebecca bauer-kahan. together, they create a thicket of legal protections for patients and providers of both abortion and gender-affirming care to keep out-of-state law enforcement out of patient records and doctors’ offices.

“there’s this commonality of the government trying to micromanage not just people’s lives, but micromanage who they are and what kind of life they’re allowed to live,” wiener said in an interview with politico.

another bill on planned parenthood’s list this year is ab 82 from assemblymember chris ward, which also intertwines protections for gender-affirming care with protections for abortion care.

ward’s bill would prevent prescriptions for testosterone or mifepristone (often used in abortions) from even being entered in the prescription drug database mentioned in wiener’s bill.

it also extends some existing protections for reproductive health and abortion providers to gender-affirming care providers as well. today, abortion providers, patients and volunteers who fear harassment or violence have extra privacy and confidentiality protections to prevent doxxing, or sharing personal information online to harass them. ward’s bill would extend those protections to patients and providers of gender-affirming care as well.

“it is imperative that we support the privacy and safety of patients and their families,” ward said in a statement.

the specter of the trump administration looms large over the entire bill package. one proposal, from sen. akilah weber-pierson — who is also a trained ob-gyn — is a direct response to the administration’s threats to cut medicaid.

her bill, sb 528, proposes creating “the health care maintenance and expansion fund,” which would use state revenue or private donations to pay for services that could be cut from medicaid. this is meant to ensure that if the trump administration ends medi-cal funding that’s used for treatments and services like abortion, family planning or gender-affirming care, the state would still offer its own funding. it’s extra pertinent now, as the trump administration just announced tens of millions of dollars in cuts to the title x family planning program, including delays in grants to california.

weber-pierson said she is “deeply concerned” about the title x grants, which are used to help low-income people get sti screenings, contraception and other reproductive health care services. her bill wasn’t specifically written in response to the title x cuts, but could ultimately help fill those gaps, she said.

“whether it could help backfill some of this lost funding will ultimately depend on the budget process and how we implement it, but i am committed to fighting for the resources necessary to protect reproductive healthcare access in our state,” weber-pierson said in a statement to politico.

hicks said the bill could also help planned parenthoods around the state: as one of if not the largest providers of gender-affirming care in the state, the clinics could also lose medicaid funding under the executive order from trump that threatens to cut funding to anyone that provides this care.

and in order to further shore up the state’s reproductive and sexual health infrastructure, planned parenthood is also supporting sb 339 from state sen. christopher cabaldon to increase the rates medi-cal pays for sti testing.

planned parenthood is also working on medication abortion access with two bills, ab 54 from assemblymember maggy krell and ab 260 from assembly majority leader cecilia aguiar-curry. they both reaffirm the right to access mifepristone in the state, and hicks said they could both change throughout the legislative process if lawmakers adjust for other potential state impacts from washington.

aguiar-curry’s bill is modeled off a similar one that just became law in new york, which lets providers keep their names off abortion medication prescriptions, and adds extra privacy protections as well.

“with federal threats to reproductive rights, it’s more important than ever that we stand strong in protecting the rights of california women and their health care providers to make decisions for ourselves and our families,” aguiar-curry said in a statement.","['california', 'reproductive', 'health', 'care', 'advocate', 'move', 'extend', 'playbook', 'abortion', 'protection', 'transgender',

e98accee-dc4b-4117-bdf7-ba8fac3c77f5,anti,trump picks lightning-rod california legislator to be us attorney in los angeles,"['trump', 'pick', 'lightning', 'rod', 'california', 'legislator', 'attorney', 'los', 'angeles']",politico,blake jones,https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/01/donald-trump-lightning-rod-california-legislator-us-attorney-los-angeles-00265322,4/1/2025,"president donald trump has chosen a california republican state lawmaker who helped prosecute the 2015 san bernardino terrorist attacks and elevated his profile antagonizing democrats in the state legislature to be the next u.s. attorney in los angeles.

assemblymember bill essayli will resign from the legislature on tuesday night and begin the new role on wednesday, according to two people with direct knowledge of his plans who were granted anonymity because they weren’t authorized to speak publicly on the matter. his nomination, previously unreported, demonstrates how trump’s return to office has heightened the relevance of california republicans who are frequently sidelined in the democratic-supermajority state.


essayli will oversee federal law enforcement in the central district of california — the nation’s most populous federal court jurisdiction, which encompasses large swaths of southern california and nearly 20 million residents. he served as an assistant u.s. attorney in the office earlier in his career.

representatives for essayli and the white house didn’t respond to requests for comment.

essayli has since 2022 represented a conservative pocket of inland southern california in the statehouse. there, he focused heavily on gender issues, traveling to local school board meetings to advocate for policies requiring school staff to alert parents if a student showed signs of being transgender. he also carried unsuccessful legislation that would have made such “parental notification” mandatory statewide.

he presented a bill tuesday that would ban transgender athletes’ participation in girls’ and women’s sports, an issue that was given oxygen in sacramento when gov. gavin newsom broke with fellow democrats on the issue last month.

essayli focused his testimony on the legal side of the issue, echoing a trump administration interpretation of title ix which argues the civil rights law already precludes trans girls from participating on school sports teams matching their gender identity.

california’s allowance of trans sports participation is “not just bad policy, it’s also a flagrant violation of title ix and puts california schools at risk of losing billions in federal funding,” essayli said during a committee hearing tuesday. “i believe california will come into compliance with title ix, either through this legislative process or the court process.”

the son of lebanese immigrants, essayli became the first muslim member of his chamber when he was elected in 2022.

he frequently angered ruling democrats and even frustrated some moderates within his own caucus with his pugnacious approach. one especially memorable episode came on the last night of last year’s legislative session, when legislative democrats had run out of time to hear all the bills on their docket and declined to call on him to speak as they rushed through their agenda.

“i have the goddamn right to speak,” he yelled while banging on his desk minutes before midnight.

the democrat overseeing the proceedings told essayli he was out of order.

“you are a fucking liar,” essayli yelled back twice, before walking off the assembly floor.

essayli found unique ways to agitate the opposing party, recently joining forces with advocates of a slavery reparations proposal that democrats held during that same final day of the legislative session. and he developed powerful alliances, recently working with trump’s special envoy richard grenell and republican assemblymember carl demaio to qualify a statewide voter id requirement for the ballot in 2026.

trump has also nominated california attorney harmeet dhillon to lead his department of justice’s civil rights division.

essayli will replace acting u.s. attorney joseph mcnally, who filled the post earlier this year after biden-appointed martin estrada left for private practice just before trump’s inauguration.

the position requires senate confirmation. confirmation for most u.s. attorney jobs is typically routine, though california sen. adam schiff has promised to hold up the confirmation of d.c.-based acting attorney ed martin.","['president', 'donald', 'trump', 'choose', 'california', 'republican', 'state', 'lawmaker', 'helped', 'prosecute', 'san', 'bernardino', 'terrorist', 'attack', 'elevate', 'profile', 'antagonize', 'democrat', 'state', 'legislature', 'attorney', 'los', 'angeles', 'assemblymember', 'bill', 'essayli', 'resign', 'legislature', 'tuesday', 'night', 'begin', 'new', 'role', 'wednesday', 'accord', 'people', 'direct', 'knowledge', 'plan', 'grant', 'anonymity', 'authorize', 'speak', 'publicly', 'matter', 'nomination', 'previously', 'unreporte', 'demonstrate', 'trump', 'return', 'office', 'heighten', 'relevance', 'california', 'republicans', 'frequently', 'sideline', 'democratic', 'supermajority', 'state', 'essayli', 'oversee', 'federal', 'law', 'enforcement', 'central', 'district', 'california', 'nation', 'populous', 'federal', 'court', 'jurisdiction', 'encompass', 'large', 'swath', 'southern', 'california', 'nearly', 'million', 'resident', 'serve', 'assistant', 'attorney', 'office', 'early', 'career', 'representative', 'essayli', 'white', 'house', 'respond', 'request', 'comment', 'essayli', 'represent', 'conservative', 'pocket', 'inland', 'southern', 'california', 'statehouse', 'focus', 'heavily', 'gender', 'issue', 'travel', 'local', 'school', 'board', 'meeting', 'advocate', 'policy', 'require', 'school', 'staff', 'alert', 'parent', 'student', 'show', 'sign', 'transgender', 'carry', 'unsuccessful', 'legislation', 'parental', 'notification', 'mandatory', 'statewide', 'present', 'bill', 'tuesday', 'ban', 'transgender', 'athlete', 'participation', 'girl', 'woman', 'sport', 'issue', 'give', 'oxygen', 'sacramento', 'gov', 'gavin', 'newsom', 'break', 'fellow', 'democrat', 'issue', 'month', 'essayli', 'focus', 'testimony', 'legal', 'issue', 'echo', 'trump', 'administration', 'interpretation', 'title', 'ix', 'argue', 'civil', 'right', 'law', 'preclude', 'tran', 'girl', 'participate', 'school', 'sport', 'team', 'match', 'gender', 'identity', 'california', 'allowance', 'trans', 'sport', 'participation', 'bad', 'policy', 'flagrant', 'violation', 'title', 'ix', 'put', 'california', 'school', 'risk', 'lose', 'billion', 'federal', 'funding', 'essayli', 'say', 'committee', 'hearing', 'tuesday', 'believe', 'california', 'come', 'compliance', 'title', 'ix', 'legislative', 'process', 'court', 'process', 'son', 'lebanese', 'immigrant', 'essayli', 'muslim', 'member', 'chamber', 'elect', 'frequently', 'anger', 'rule', 'democrat', 'frustrate', 'moderate', 'caucus', 'pugnacious', 'approach', 'especially', 'memorable', 'episode', 'come', 'night', 'year', 'legislative', 'session', 'legislative', 'democrat', 'run', 'time', 'hear', 'bill', 'docket', 'decline', 'speak', 'rush', 'agenda', 'goddamn', 'right', 'speak', 'yell', 'bang', 'desk', 'minute', 'midnight', 'democrat', 'oversee', 'proceeding', 'tell', 'essayli', 'order', 'fucking', 'liar', 'essayli', 'yell', 'twice', 'walk', 'assembly', 'floor', 'essayli', 'find', 'unique', 'way', 'agitate', 'oppose', 'party', 'recently', 'join', 'force', 'advocate', 'slavery', 'reparation', 'proposal', 'democrats', 'hold', 'final', 'day', 'legislative', 'session', 'develop', 'powerful', 'alliance', 'recently', 'work', 'trump', 'special', 'envoy', 'richard', 'grenell', 'republican', 'assemblymember', 'carl', 'demaio', 'qualify', 'statewide', 'voter', 'd', 'requirement', 'ballot', 'trump', 'nominate', 'california', 'attorney', 'harmeet', 'dhillon', 'lead', 'department', 'justice', 'civil', 'right', 'division', 'essayli', 'replace', 'act', 'attorney', 'joseph', 'mcnally', 'fill', 'post', 'early', 'year', 'biden', 'appoint', 'martin', 'estrada', 'leave', 'private', 'practice', 'trump', 'inauguration', 'position', 'require', 'senate', 'confirmation', 'confirmation', 'attorney', 'job', 'typically', 'routine', 'california', 'sen', 'adam', 'schiff', 'promise', 'hold', 'confirmation', 'acting', 'attorney', 'ed', 'martin']",
879f0983-e258-4431-b188-3fc86ec1dcf9,anti,federal judge rules against parents seeking to protest transgender athletes with wristband,"['federal', 'judge', 'rule', 'parent', 'seek', 'protest', 'transgender', 'athlete', 'wristband']",fox,michael dorgan,https://www.foxnews.com/us/federal-judge-rules-against-parents-seeking-protest-transgender-athletes-wristband,4/15/2025,"a federal judge in new hampshire is siding with a local school district in preventing parents from wearing armbands on school property in support of biological girls-only sports.

in september, the parents wore pink-colored ""xx"" wristbands during a high school soccer game where transgender athlete parker tirrell, now 16, was playing on an opposing team. the wristbands referenced the sex chromosomes associated with biological females.

the protest led to bow and dunbarton school districts superintendent marcy kelley issuing a notice of trespass against parents anthony and nicole foote, along with kyle fellers and eldon rash, according to the new hampshire journal. the parents then sued the school district, claiming their first amendment rights were violated. while the no-trespass orders have since expired, they asked the judge to allow them to carry signs and wear the wristbands featuring the symbol for female chromosomes at school events while the case proceeds.

on monday, u.s. district court judge steven mcauliffe, a president george h. w. bush appointee, ruled that the district acted reasonably in its decision to prevent parents from protesting.

mcauliffe said the parents’ ""narrow, plausibly inoffensive"" intentions were not as important as the wider context, and that adults attending a high school athletic event do not enjoy a first amendment-protected right to convey messages that demean, harass or harm students. ""while plaintiffs may very well have never intended to communicate a demeaning or harassing message directed at parker tirrell or any other transgender students, the symbols and posters they displayed were fully capable of conveying such a message,"" he wrote. ""and, that broader messaging is what the school authorities reasonably understood and appropriately tried to prevent.""

""the broader and more demeaning/harassing message the school district understood plaintiffs’ ‘xx’ symbols to convey was, in context, entirely reasonable,"" wrote mcauliffe.

fellers and foote testified that they had not intended to harass or otherwise target a transgender player on the opposing team, but the school district said differently. the group of parents had also not protested at any previous game. in the days leading up to the game, another parent told school officials that she had overheard others talk about showing up to the game wearing dresses and heckling the transgender player.

""when we suspect there’s some sort of threat . . . we don’t wait for it to happen,"" kelley said previously.

in february, the parents asked the court to rule that they be allowed to wear pink wristbands at the spring games to protest transgender athletes competing in girls’ sports. their request for a preliminary injection was denied, and the court has yet to rule on the request to wear the pink wristbands at all school sporting events, per the concord monitor. del kolde, a senior attorney for the institute for free speech and one of the attorneys representing the parents, said he strongly disagrees with the court’s opinion issued denying their request for a preliminary injunction.

""this was adult speech in a limited public forum, which enjoys greater first amendment protection than student speech in the classroom,"" kolde said in a statement to the outlet. ""bow school district officials were obviously discriminating based on viewpoint because they perceived the xx wristbands to be ‘trans-exclusionary’.""","['federal', 'judge', 'new', 'hampshire', 'side', 'local', 'school', 'district', 'prevent', 'parent', 'wear', 'armband', 'school', 'property', 'support', 'biological', 'girl', 'sport', 'september', 'parent', 'wear', 'pink', 'color', 'xx', 'wristband', 'high', 'school', 'soccer', 'game', 'transgender', 'athlete', 'parker', 'tirrell', 'play', 'oppose', 'team', 'wristband', 'reference', 'sex', 'chromosome', 'associate', 'biological', 'female', 'protest', 'lead', 'bow', 'dunbarton', 'school', 'district', 'superintendent', 'marcy', 'kelley', 'issue', 'notice', 'trespass', 'parent', 'anthony', 'nicole', 'foote', 'kyle', 'feller', 'eldon', 'rash', 'accord', 'new', 'hampshire', 'journal', 'parent', 'sue', 'school', 'district', 'claim', 'amendment', 'right', 'violate', 'trespass', 'order', 'expire', 'ask', 'judge', 'allow', 'carry', 'sign', 'wear', 'wristband', 'feature', 'symbol', 'female', 'chromosome', 'school', 'event', 'case', 'proceed', 'monday', 'district', 'court', 'judge', 'steven', 'mcauliffe', 'president', 'george', 'bush', 'appointee', 'rule', 'district', 'act', 'reasonably', 'decision', 'prevent', 'parent', 'protest', 'mcauliffe', 'say', 'parent', 'narrow', 'plausibly', 'inoffensive', 'intention', 'important', 'wide', 'context', 'adult', 'attend', 'high', 'school', 'athletic', 'event', 'enjoy', 'amendment', 'protect', 'right', 'convey', 'message', 'demean', 'harass', 'harm', 'student', 'plaintiff', 'intend', 'communicate', 'demeaning', 'harass', 'message', 'direct', 'parker', 'tirrell', 'transgender', 'student', 'symbol', 'poster', 'display', 'fully', 'capable', 'convey', 'message', 'write', 'broad', 'message', 'school', 'authority', 'reasonably', 'understand', 'appropriately', 'try', 'prevent', 'broad', 'demeaning', 'harass', 'message', 'school', 'district', 'understand', 'plaintiff', 'xx', 'symbol', 'convey', 'context', 'entirely', 'reasonable', 'write', 'mcauliffe', 'feller', 'foote', 'testify', 'intend', 'harass', 'target', 'transgender', 'player', 'oppose', 'team', 'school', 'district', 'say', 'differently', 'group', 'parent', 'protest', 'previous', 'game', 'day', 'lead', 'game', 'parent', 'tell', 'school', 'official', 'overhear', 'talk', 'show', 'game', 'wear', 'dress', 'heckle', 'transgender', 'player', 'suspect', 'sort', 'threat', 'wait', 'happen', 'kelley', 'say', 'previously', 'february', 'parent', 'ask', 'court', 'rule', 'allow', 'wear', 'pink', 'wristband', 'spring', 'game', 'protest', 'transgender', 'athlete', 'compete', 'girl', 'sport', 'request', 'preliminary', 'injection', 'deny', 'court', 'rule', 'request', 'wear', 'pink', 'wristband', 'school', 'sporting', 'event', 'concord', 'monitor', 'del', 'kolde', 'senior', 'attorney', 'institute', 'free', 'speech', 'attorney', 'represent', 'parent', 'say', 'strongly', 'disagree', 'court', 'opinion', 'issue', 'deny', 'request', 'preliminary', 'injunction', 'adult', 'speech', 'limited', 'public', 'forum', 'enjoy', 'great', 'amendment', 'protection', 'student', 'speech', 'classroom', 'kolde', 'say', 'statement', 'outlet', 'bow', 'school', 'district', 'official', 'obviously', 'discriminate', 'base', 'viewpoint', 'perceive', 'xx', 'wristband', 'trans', 'exclusionary']",
a5167834-0dd6-4197-a968-9c0880dc261a,anti,hhs probing hospital over firing of nurse who blew whistle on minors getting gender treatments,"['hhs', 'probe', 'hospital', 'firing', 'nurse', 'blow', 'whistle', 'minor', 'get', 'gender', 'treatment']",fox,"rachel wolf , nate foy",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/hhs-probing-hospital-over-firing-nurse-who-blew-whistle-minors-getting-gender-treatments,4/18/2025,"the department of health and human services (hhs) is probing ""a major pediatric teaching hospital"" over the alleged firing of a nurse who sought a religious exemption to avoid administering puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones to children.

""the department will robustly enforce federal laws protecting these courageous whistleblowers, including laws that protect healthcare professionals from being forced to violate their religious beliefs or moral convictions,"" acting hhs ocr director anthony archeval said in a statement.

while hhs has not confirmed the hospital’s identity, it is believed to be texas children’s hospital (tch) — the largest children’s hospital in the u.s. — as the investigation follows whistleblower nurse vanessa sivadge’s testimony on capitol hill. sivadge first came forward publicly in june 2024 and was later fired in august 2024. sivadge told lawmakers that she had witnessed ""disturbing trends and concerning practices"" relating to the treatment of children diagnosed with gender dysphoria. she also said that she ""observed the powerful and irreversible effects"" of treatments that patients were told were ""lifesaving."" 

""i witnessed firsthand how doctors emotionally blackmailed parents by telling them that if they did not affirm their child’s false identity, their child would harm themselves. in particular, i was saddened to see young girls suffering from profound mental health struggles like depression and anxiety, many of whom had also suffered sexual abuse or trauma, persuaded by doctors at texas children’s that a hormone would resolve their gender confusion,"" sivadge told lawmakers.

dr. eithan haim, who was accused of violating hipaa while in surgical training at baylor college of medicine, which is affiliated with tch, also blew the whistle on the hospital for ""lying about the existence of its transgender program."" the biden doj brought charges against haim for the alleged hipaa violations, but the case was ultimately dropped under the trump administration.

haim claimed the hospital was engaging in fraudulent billing practices to hide the fact that it was carrying out transgender procedures on minors even though it was against texas law. this included recording mastectomies as ""breast reduction"" surgeries and billing testosterone prescribed to a teen girl under a male diagnosis.

in her testimony, sivadge said that federal agents came to her home when investigating the whistleblower, now known to be haim, because of her objections to transgender medicine. she described the interaction as intimidating and said that one of the special agents ""effectively asked me to compromise my christian beliefs and made veiled threats regarding my career and safety if i didn’t comply with their demands.""

sivadge's attorney filed a complaint with the u.s. equal employment opportunity commission (eeoc) on april 11, alleging that she ""observed tch doctors, after very little deliberation or critical analysis, embarking children on dangerous and often irreversible courses of ‘gender-affirming’ treatment.""

according to the complaint, tch ""temporarily"" paused ""gender-affirming services"" for minors after texas attorney general ken paxton said in february 2022 that such treatments could constitute child abuse. the treatments were banned in the state following the passage of a bill in may 2023, which went into effect in september 2023. according to sivadge's attorney, she asked to be transferred back to cardiology in may 2024, citing her religious beliefs.

the investigation, which will be carried out by the newly-formed title ix investigations team in conjunction with the u.s. department of education and department of justice, was announced on friday by education secretary linda mcmahon. 

the incident, which occurred at the cherry blossom open in maryland on march 30, saw female fencer stephanie turner take a knee in protest of trans competitor redmond sullivan. turner was then disqualified from the event and escorted out of the venue.

usa fencing provided a statement to fox news digital saying it will cooperate with the investigation. 

""usa fencing will respond and cooperate to any inquiry as required by law,"" the statement read. the incident involving turner quickly drew national attention after a video of her taking a knee to protest sullivan went viral. the footage ignited widespread awareness and backlash against usa fencing's gender eligibility policies. 

turner told fox news digital that she came to the decision to take the knee the night before the event, when she checked the competition pools and saw that she would be competing against sullivan.

""i saw that i was going to be in a pool with redmond, and from there i said, ‘ok, let’s do it. i'm going to take the knee,'"" turner said. ""i knew what i had to do because usa fencing had not been listening to women's objections regarding [its gender eligibility policy]."" usa fencing first enacted its current trans-inclusion policy in 2023. it allows transgender athletes to compete in the women's category at both the junior and senior level after completing one calendar year of testosterone suppression treatment. proof of compliant hormone therapy must be provided prior to competition, but the organization has taken even further steps to prioritize its trans competitors. 

in november 2022, it announced a policy to give preference when selecting host cities for national tournaments to states without laws that ""harm members of lgbtq communities"" and states that do not ""have laws undermining the reproductive health of women."" that policy went into effect in the 2023 season, the same year it changed its gender policy. it later released a list of states that it intended to ""avoid where possible"" and the states that it flat out would not allow hosting major events. this past december, a nonprofit fencing organization, the fair fencing organization, penned an open letter to usa fencing board members urging the re-evaluation of its stance on several issues, including transgender inclusion. just days later, however, board members voted against several motions to approve an all-female task force to re-evaluate and revise the current transgender policy, in an 8-3 vote. 

now, after siding against women fencers seeking protection from trans inclusion, usa fencing faces potential federal sanctions.

this title ix investigation will be one of the first missions for the newly formed title ix investigations team, which was officially formed last week. the initiative was announced last friday with the mission to ""protect female athletes, from the pernicious effects of gender ideology in school programs and activities.""","['usa', 'fencing', 'acknowledge', 'forthcoming', 'federal', 'investigation', 'incident', 'occur', 'event', 'woman', 'fencer', 'punish', 'refuse', 'face', 'transgender', 'competitor', 'investigation', 'carry', 'newly', 'form', 'title', 'ix', 'investigation', 'team', 'conjunction', 'department', 'education', 'department', 'justice', 'announce', 'friday', 'education', 'secretary', 'linda', 'mcmahon', 'incident', 'occur', 'cherry', 'blossom', 'open', 'maryland', 'march', 'see', 'female', 'fencer', 'stephanie', 'turner', 'knee', 'protest', 'trans', 'competitor', 'redmond', 'sullivan', 'turner', 'disqualify', 'event', 'escort', 'venue', 'usa', 'fencing', 'provide', 'statement', 'fox', 'news', 'digital', 'say', 'cooperate', 'investigation', 'usa', 'fencing', 'respond', 'cooperate', 'inquiry', 'require', 'law', 'statement', 'read', 'incident', 'involve', 'turner', 'quickly', 'draw', 'national', 'attention', 'video', 'take', 'knee', 'protest', 'sullivan', 'go', 'viral', 'footage', 'ignite', 'widespread', 'awareness', 'backlash', 'usa', 'fencing', 'gender', 'eligibility', 'policy', 'turner', 'tell', 'fox', 'news', 'digital', 'come', 'decision', 'knee', 'night', 'event', 'check', 'competition', 'pool', 'see', 'compete', 'sullivan', 'see', 'go', 'pool', 'redmond', 'say', 'ok', 'let', 'go', 'knee', 'turner', 'say', 'know', 'usa', 'fencing', 'listen', 'woman', 'objection', 'gender', 'eligibility', 'policy', 'usa', 'fencing', 'enact', 'current', 'trans', 'inclusion', 'policy', 'allow', 'transgender', 'athlete', 'compete', 'woman', 'category', 'junior', 'senior', 'level', 'complete', 'calendar', 'year', 'testosterone', 'suppression', 'treatment', 'proof', 'compliant', 'hormone', 'therapy', 'provide', 'prior', 'competition', 'organization', 'take', 'step', 'prioritize', 'trans', 'competitor', 'november', 'announce', 'policy', 'preference', 'select', 'host', 'city', 'national', 'tournament', 'state', 'law', 'harm', 'member', 'lgbtq', 'community', 'state', 'law', 'undermine', 'reproductive', 'health', 'woman', 'policy', 'go', 'effect', 'season', 'year', 'change', 'gender', 'policy', 'later', 'release', 'list', 'state', 'intend', 'avoid', 'possible', 'state', 'flat', 'allow', 'host', 'major', 'event', 'past', 'december', 'nonprofit', 'fencing', 'organization', 'fair', 'fence', 'organization', 'pen', 'open', 'letter', 'usa', 'fencing', 'board', 'member', 'urge', 'evaluation', 'stance', 'issue', 'include', 'transgender', 'inclusion', 'day', 'later', 'board', 'member', 'vote', 'motion', 'approve', 'female', 'task', 'force', 'evaluate', 'revise', 'current', 'transgender', 'policy', 'vote', 'side', 'woman', 'fencer', 'seek', 'protection', 'trans', 'inclusion', 'usa', 'fencing', 'face', 'potential', 'federal', 'sanction', 'title', 'ix', 'investigation', 'mission', 'newly', 'form', 'title', 'ix', 'investigation', 'team', 'officially', 'form', 'week', 'initiative', 'announce', 'friday', 'mission', 'protect', 'female', 'athlete', 'pernicious', 'effect', 'gender', 'ideology', 'school', 'program', 'activity']",

ums, a network of eight public universities in maine, claims it has been compliant with the ncaa's revised gender policy to keep trans athletes out of the women's category since the ncaa's revision was made on feb. 6, and has always followed state and federal law. ums was subject to a temporary pause in funding from the usda last week during an ongoing battle between the state and the federal government over trans inclusion in women's and girls sports. the funding was reinstated just days later. 

the usda now claims the ums is in full compliance with trump's executive order. ""after the united states department of agriculture (usda) initiated a title ix compliance review regarding federal funding, the university of maine system (umaine) has clearly communicated its compliance with title ix’s requirement to protect equal opportunities for women and girls to compete in safe and fair sports, as articulated in president donald j. trump’s executive order,"" the usda said in its announcement. 

""any false claim by the umaine can, and will, result in onerous and even potentially criminal financial liability."" ums chancellor dannel malloy provided a statement to fox news digital, saying the system is ""relieved"" to have come to an understanding with the usda. 

""the university of maine system has always maintained its compliance with state and federal laws and with ncaa rules, which the u.s. department of agriculture also affirmed in a press release today,"" said chancellor malloy. 

""we are relieved to put the department’s title ix compliance review behind us so the land-grant university of maine and our statewide partners can continue to leverage usda and other essential federal funds to strengthen and grow our natural resource economy and dependent rural communities through world-class education, research and extension.""

in fiscal year 2024 alone, the usda awarded $29.78 million in funding to ums for research, the system said. the usda claims it has provided over $100 million to the ums in recent years in a letter addressed to the system. 

trump initially vowed to cut funding to maine specifically if it continued to allow trans athletes to compete in girls sports during a meeting of gop governors at the white house feb. 20.

the next day, gov. janet mills' office responded with a statement threatening legal action against the trump administration if it withheld federal funding from the state. then trump and mills verbally sparred in a widely publicized argument at the white house during a bipartisan meeting of governors.

just hours after that interaction, the u.s. department of education announced it would investigate the state for allowing transgender athletes to compete in girls sports and for potential title ix violations. 

the u.s. department of health and human services has already determined that the state and its department of education violated title ix by allowing transgender athletes to compete and warned that it will make a referral to the u.s. department of justice if the state does not provide a written agreement to comply with trump's executive order.

""what hhs is asking of the maine department of education, the maine principals’ association (mpa) and greely high school is simple — protect female athletes’ rights. girls deserve girls-only sports without male competitors. and if maine won’t come to the table to voluntarily comply with title ix, hhs will enforce title ix to the fullest extent permitted by the law,"" ocr acting director anthony archeval said in a statement to fox news digital.","['department', 'agriculture', 'announce', 'wednesday', 'university', 'maine', 'system', 'ums', 'agree', 'comply', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'executive', 'order', 'transgender', 'athlete', 'woman', 'sport', 'um', 'network', 'public', 'university', 'maine', 'claim', 'compliant', 'ncaa', 'revised', 'gender', 'policy', 'tran', 'athlete', 'woman', 'category', 'ncaa', 'revision', 'feb', 'follow', 'state', 'federal', 'law', 'ums', 'subject', 'temporary', 'pause', 'funding', 'usda', 'week', 'ongoing', 'battle', 'state', 'federal', 'government', 'trans', 'inclusion', 'woman', 'girl', 'sport', 'funding', 'reinstate', 'day', 'later', 'usda', 'claim', 'ums', 'compliance', 'trump', 'executive', 'order', 'united', 'states', 'department', 'agriculture', 'usda', 'initiate', 'title', 'ix', 'compliance', 'review', 'federal', 'funding', 'university', 'maine', 'system', 'umaine', 'clearly', 'communicate', 'compliance', 'title', 'ix', 'requirement', 'protect', 'equal', 'opportunity', 'woman', 'girl', 'compete', 'safe', 'fair', 'sport', 'articulate', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'executive', 'order', 'usda', 'say', 'announcement', 'false', 'claim', 'umaine', 'result', 'onerous', 'potentially', 'criminal', 'financial', 'liability', 'ums', 'chancellor', 'dannel', 'malloy', 'provide', 'statement', 'fox', 'news', 'digital', 'say', 'system', 'relieve', 'come', 'understanding', 'usda', 'university', 'maine', 'system', 'maintain', 'compliance', 'state', 'federal', 'law', 'ncaa', 'rule', 'department', 'agriculture', 'affirm', 'press', 'release', 'today', 'say', 'chancellor', 'malloy', 'relieve', 'department', 'title', 'ix', 'compliance', 'review', 'land', 'grant', 'university', 'maine', 'statewide', 'partner', 'continue', 'leverage', 'usda', 'essential', 'federal', 'fund', 'strengthen', 'grow', 'natural', 'resource', 'economy', 'dependent', 'rural', 'community', 'world', 'class', 'education', 'research', 'extension', 'fiscal', 'year', 'usda', 'award', 'million', 'funding', 'ums', 'research', 'system', 'say', 'usda', 'claim', 'provide', 'million', 'ums', 'recent', 'year', 'letter', 'address', 'system', 'trump', 'initially', 'vow', 'cut', 'funding', 'maine', 'specifically', 'continue', 'allow', 'tran', 'athlete', 'compete', 'girl', 'sport', 'meeting', 'gop', 'governor', 'white', 'house', 'feb', 'day', 'gov', 'janet', 'mills', 'office', 'respond', 'statement', 'threaten', 'legal', 'action', 'trump', 'administration', 'withhold', 'federal', 'funding', 'state', 'trump', 'mill', 'verbally', 'spar', 'widely', 'publicize', 'argument', 'white', 'house', 'bipartisan', 'meeting', 'governor', 'hour', 'interaction', 'department', 'education', 'announce', 'investigate', 'state', 'allow', 'transgender', 'athlete', 'compete', 'girl', 'sport', 'potential', 'title', 'ix', 'violation', 'department', 'health', 'human', 'service', 'determine', 'state', 'department', 'education', 'violate', 'title', 'ix', 'allow', 'transgender', 'athlete', 'compete', 'warn', 'referral', 'department', 'justice', 'state', 'provide', 'write', 'agreement', 'comply', 'trump', 'executive', 'order', 'hhs', 'ask', 'maine', 'department', 'education', 'maine', 'principal', 'association', 'mpa', 'greely', 'high', 'school', 'simple', 'protect', 'female', 'athlete', 'right', 'girl', 'deserve', 'girl', 'sport', 'male', 'competitor', 'maine', 'will', 'come', 'table', 'voluntarily', 'comply', 'title', 'ix', 'hhs', 'enforce', 'title', 'ix', 'full', 'extent', 'permit', 'law', 'ocr', 'act', 'director', 'anthony', 'archeval', 'say', 'statement', 'fox', 'news', 'digital']",

harriet haynes and lucy smith went toe-to-toe in the ultimate pool women's pro series event 2 at robin park leisure centre in wigan.

both competitors defeated four female opponents each to get to the championship bout. each of haynes' matchups were rather close, but smith dominated in the early going of the bracket. smith defeated jane mitchell 7 frames to 3 in the first round and then beat vicki lomax, 7-1.

haynes led the championship match, 6-3, at a point, but smith came back to cut the deficit to one. haynes, though, held on to the victory.

according to ultimate pool group, smith won 85 of 113 matches and 62% of 848 frames dating back to 2021 before entering the final. haynes owned a .750 winning percentage in 241 lifetime matches and won 61% of the frames before taking on smith.

the two players wound up facing each other in the semifinals of the u.k. mini series pool championships in october. haynes won that matchup but lost the championship to a biological woman.

the rules of both the english pool association and world eightball pool federation (wepf) state that trans-identified athletes are allowed to compete in the sport with absolutely no restrictions, according to their website. those bylaws for the english pool association have been under review since december 2023.
in august 2023, the wepf announced it was updating its guidelines to only allow those who were ""born female"" to play the sport.

""we understand that this decision may prompt questions and discussions within our sport. we want to emphasize that our commitment to upholding the values of sportsmanship, inclusivity, and adherence to regulatory standards remains unwavering,"" the wepf said at the time. ""our ultimate goal is to ensure the continued growth and development of the sport we all love, while maintaining a harmonious balance between inclusivity and the integrity of competition. we recognize the importance of fostering an environment where everyone can participate and thrive, and we remain dedicated to upholding these principles to the best of our ability."" but in october that year, the wepf reversed that protection. it allowed transgender competitors under the condition that they identified as female for a minimum of four years and submitted proof of lowered testosterone levels.","['woman', 'pool', 'tournament', 'championship', 'united', 'kingdom', 'feature', 'transgender', 'athlete', 'defeat', 'female', 'competition', 'harriet', 'hayne', 'lucy', 'smith', 'go', 'toe', 'toe', 'ultimate', 'pool', 'woman', 'pro', 'series', 'event', 'robin', 'park', 'leisure', 'centre', 'wigan', 'competitor', 'defeat', 'female', 'opponent', 'championship', 'bout', 'hayne', 'matchup', 'close', 'smith', 'dominate', 'early', 'going', 'bracket', 'smith', 'defeat', 'jane', 'mitchell', 'frame', 'round', 'beat', 'vicki', 'lomax', 'hayne', 'lead', 'championship', 'match', 'point', 'smith', 'come', 'cut', 'deficit', 'hayne', 'hold', 'victory', 'accord', 'ultimate', 'pool', 'group', 'smith', 'win', 'match', 'frame', 'date', 'enter', 'final', 'hayne', 'own', 'win', 'percentage', 'lifetime', 'match', 'win', 'frame', 'take', 'smith', 'player', 'wind', 'face', 'semifinal', 'mini', 'series', 'pool', 'championship', 'october', 'hayne', 'win', 'matchup', 'lose', 'championship', 'biological', 'woman', 'rule', 'english', 'pool', 'association', 'world', 'eightball', 'pool', 'federation', 'wepf', 'state', 'trans', 'identify', 'athlete', 'allow', 'compete', 'sport', 'absolutely', 'restriction', 'accord', 'website', 'bylaw', 'english', 'pool', 'association', 'review', 'december', 'august', 'wepf', 'announce', 'update', 'guideline', 'allow', 'bear', 'female', 'play', 'sport', 'understand', 'decision', 'prompt', 'question', 'discussion', 'sport', 'want', 'emphasize', 'commitment', 'uphold', 'value', 'sportsmanship', 'inclusivity', 'adherence', 'regulatory', 'standard', 'remain', 'unwavere', 'wepf', 'say', 'time', 'ultimate', 'goal', 'ensure', 'continue', 'growth', 'development', 'sport', 'love', 'maintain', 'harmonious', 'balance', 'inclusivity', 'integrity', 'competition', 'recognize', 'importance', 'foster', 'environment', 'participate', 'thrive', 'remain', 'dedicated', 'uphold', 'principle', 'good', 'ability', 'october', 'year', 'wepf', 'reverse', 'protection', 'allow', 'transgender', 'competitor', 'condition', 'identify', 'female', 'minimum', 'year', 'submit', 'proof', 'lowered', 'testosterone', 'level']",

wagner college confirmed to fox news digital that redmond sullivan was off the team more than a week following the controversy at the cherry blossom open in maryland. sullivan is shown to have competed for the wagner women’s team in the foil competition in several meets during the first half of the 2024-25 season. sullivan participated on the men’s team during the 2023-24 season, scoresheets from meets during the season showed.

the ncaa changed its transgender-inclusion policy after president donald trump signed the ""no men in women's sports"" executive order.

""a student-athlete assigned male at birth may not compete on a women’s team,"" the policy read.

sullivan was at the cherry blossom open and was set to face off against stephanie turner. ""this is a serious issue that is happening within all sports, and it needs to be addressed. there is a difference between men and women,"" turner said. ""it is a civil rights movement for women and girls, and i prioritize the safety and rights and protection of women and girls over trans-identified males.""

turner decided to take a knee in protest of sullivan’s inclusion in the meet and of usa fencing’s transgender-participation policies. turner spoke to fox news digital about her decision to protest and ultimately get expelled from the event. usa fencing has since defended its transgender participation policies.

sullivan’s club team, iconic fencing club, backed the fencer after the event with turner.

""red has followed every rule and guideline set forth by the fie and usa fencing, the statement said. ""she has every right to compete in the events that she qualifies for, and has long since met the criteria to do so.

“transgender, nonbinary, and gender diverse patients prescribed hormones had a 15% lower risk of moderate-to-severe depressive symptoms over 4 years of follow-up compared with those not prescribed hormones,” said lead study author dr. sari reisner, associate professor of epidemiology at university of michigan school of public health, in an email.

the study analyzed data of 3,592 patients of two federally qualified community health centers in boston and new york city and looked at both their hormone therapy prescription and their patient health questionnaire scores, which indicated their depression levels.

those participants who received hormone therapy had significantly lower risks of moderate to severe depression symptoms in their four years of follow-ups, according to the study published monday in the journal jama network open.

“when gender diverse patients access medically safe and effective hormone medication and care they are more likely to experience healthier mental health outcomes over time,” said dr. michelle forcier, medical director for folx health, a mental health and wellness telehealth platform for people in the lgbtqia+ community, and clinician at transhealth, a non-profit clinic in florence, massachusetts.

“providing gender hormones did not just provide physical benefits to transgender and gender diverse patients, but yet again, we demonstrate that they improve their mental health outcomes as well,” added forcier, who is also assistant dean of admissions at the warren alpert medical school of brown university. she was not involved in the research.

the study comes amid president donald trump’s executive orders that would restrict gender-affirming medical care for transgender youth, ban trans women from competing in most women’s sports and discharge transgender military members and recruits.

depression rates higher in transgender population
depression rates in people who are transgender, nonbinary or gender diverse are a public health crisis and need to be addressed, reisner said.

“trans people experience mental health disparities with higher rates of depression and suicidality than cisgender (non-transgender) people,” he added. “trans people are literally dying. there is an urgent need — now more than ever — to care for us, support us, and ensure we have the life-saving care that we deserve and need to thrive.”

an estimated 8.3% of us adults have experienced at least one major depressive episode, according to the national institute of mental health. but a 2023 study found that about 33% of transgender people showed signs of depression. the higher rates of poorer health outcomes –– including anxiety, depression and suicidality –– in transgender people can be due to many factors, but a big contributor is the effects of bias and discrimination, forcier said.

“minority stress and discrimination also leads to higher risks for economic disadvantage, housing and homeless difficulties, substance use/abuse, and hiv. these cumulative disadvantages can significantly impact many aspects of physical and mental health,” she said.

systemic problems, including stigma, attacks on civil rights and preventing access to health care exacerbates mental health challenges, added dr. melina wald, a clinical psychologist at her private practice bespoke psychology in connecticut and new york state, via email. wald cofounded columbia university medical center’s gender and sexuality program.

wald was not involved in the research.

bills targeting medical care for transgender people have been on the rise, reisner said.

in 2018, “2 bills were introduced and in 2023, there were 185 bills. recent executive orders banning ‘gender ideology’ and restricting the rights of trans people have devastating mental health consequences for trans communities,” he added in an email.

accessible to everyone
one strength of the study was the diversity in the ages, races, ethnicities and socioeconomic statuses of the population, forcier said.

“this sample is much more reflective of the diversity of the us population than previous specialty clinic-based studies,” she said. “the us is an increasingly diverse population and medical studies that reflect this offer more valuable insights to care.”

the study also shows that effective hormone care might be feasible in more diverse community settings, forcier said.

“that these patients benefited from care in these various primary care clinics in a diversity of communities suggests that effective gender affirmative hormone is no longer restricted to urban, academic, specialty clinics,” she added in an email.

overall, the scientific literature shows that hormone therapy is safe and effective, forcier said.

“we have more than 25 years of consistent, persistent, insistent evidence that gender affirmative approaches to care for transgender persons offer a variety of medical and mental health benefits. there are no studies that suggest that withholding medically indicated, safe, effective care (offers) any benefit at all,” she said. that said, care for depression in the transgender population should not end at hormone therapy, wald said.

“while gender affirming hormone therapy is crucially important to improving mental health, the importance of access to evidence-based psychiatric interventions for treatment of depression should not be overlooked,” she said. “it is a both/and approach rather than either/or.”","['gender', 'affirm', 'hormone', 'therapy', 'help', 'patient', 'mental', 'health', 'physical', 'body', 'accord', 'new',

“well, i think it’s an issue of fairness. i completely agree with you on that. it is an issue of fairness. it’s deeply unfair,” newsom said in a podcast episode with conservative activist charlie kirk.

“i revere sports, and so the issue of fairness is completely legit. and i saw that the last couple of years. boy did i saw how [republicans] were able to weaponize that issue at another level,” he said. newsom addressed both sides of the issue, saying, “you know that these poor people are more likely to commit suicide, have anxiety and depression, and the way that people talk down to vulnerable communities is an issue that i have a hard time with as well. so both things i can hold in my hand.”

newsom’s comments come after president donald trump signed an executive order last month banning transgender women from competing in women’s sports, delivering on a political issue central to his 2024 campaign.

other democrats have gotten pushback for comments similar to newsom’s. democratic rep. seth moulton of massachusetts has been vocal about transgender policies and told the new york times in november that identity politics, particularly around transgender rights, hurt democrats in the election, saying, “i have two little girls. i don’t want them getting run over on a playing field by a male or formerly male athlete. but as a democrat, i’m supposed to be afraid to say that.”

moulton got criticism from democrats for his comments, and his campaign manager, matt chilliak, resigned in response to the remarks, according to the boston globe. newsom has a long record of supporting lgbtq rights. he ordered the city and county of san francisco to start issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples in 2004 after being elected mayor of san francisco.

the california governor’s comments come as he eyes a potential 2028 presidential bid, having watched republicans wield the issue against democrats last cycle. transgender policies were a major factor in the advertising wars of the 2024 presidential race, as trump and his allies leaned into sharp attacks on former vice president kamala harris’ record, running waves of stark tv spots.

“kamala’s agenda is they/them, not you,” said one ad, referring to the pronouns used by some transgender and non-binary individuals.

newsom called the ad “devastating” to her campaign during the podcast. he went further, saying, “she didn’t even react to it, which was even more devastating.”

in total, republican advertisers spent more than $60 million on ads that referenced transgender policies and lgbtq rights during the 2024 presidential campaign, some of which included specific references to athletics participation, according to data from the ad tracking firm adimpact.

the debate spilled into some key congressional races as well, as republican candidates echoed the messaging from pro-trump advertisers.

an ad from texas gop sen. ted cruz, who was challenged unsuccessfully by democratic rep. colin allred last year, featured several girls playing school sports as a large, dark shadow looms over them. a narrator says, “colin allred could have stopped men from competing in women’s sports, but instead he voted against our daughters. what kind of man does that?”

in response to the criticism, allred became the first democrat that year to take to the airwaves directly rebutting the attacks, saying in an ad of his own that “i don’t want boys playing girls sports or any of this ridiculous stuff that ted cruz is saying.”","['democratic', 'california', 'gov', 'gavin', 'newsom', 'say', 'transgender', 'athlete', 'play', 'woman', 'sport', 'issue', 'fairness', 'break', 'democrat', 'position', 'topic', 'think', 'issue', 'fairness', 'completely', 'agree', 'issue', 'fairness', 'deeply', 'unfair', 'newsom', 'say', 'podcast', 'episode', 'conservative', 'activist', 'charlie', 'kirk', 'revere', 'sport', 'issue', 'fairness', 'completely', 'legit', 'see', 'couple', 'year', 'boy', 'see', 'republicans', 'able', 'weaponize', 'issue', 'level', 'say', 'newsom', 'address', 'side', 'issue', 'say', 'know', 'poor', 'people', 'likely', 'commit', 'suicide', 'anxiety', 'depression', 'way', 'people', 'talk', 'vulnerable', 'community', 'issue', 'hard', 'time', 'thing', 'hold', 'hand', 'newsom', 'comment', 'come', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'sign', 'executive', 'order', 'month', 'ban', 'transgender', 'woman', 'compete', 'woman', 'sport', 'deliver', 'political', 'issue', 'central', 'campaign', 'democrat', 'get', 'pushback', 'comment', 'similar', 'newsom', 'democratic', 'rep', 'seth', 'moulton', 'massachusetts', 'vocal', 'transgender', 'policy', 'tell', 'new', 'york', 'times', 'november', 'identity', 'politic', 'particularly', 'transgender', 'right', 'hurt', 'democrat', 'election', 'say', 'little', 'girl', 'want', 'getting', 'run', 'playing', 'field', 'male', 'male', 'athlete', 'democrat', 'suppose', 'afraid', 'moulton', 'get', 'criticism', 'democrats', 'comment', 'campaign', 'manager', 'matt', 'chilliak', 'resign', 'response', 'remark', 'accord', 'boston', 'globe', 'newsom', 'long', 'record', 'support', 'lgbtq', 'right', 'order', 'city', 'county', 'san', 'francisco', 'start', 'issue', 'marriage', 'license', 'sex', 'couple', 'elect', 'mayor', 'san', 'francisco', 'california', 'governor', 'comment', 'come', 'eye', 'potential', 'presidential', 'bid', 'having', 'watch', 'republicans', 'wield', 'issue', 'democrats', 'cycle', 'transgender', 'policy', 'major', 'factor', 'advertising', 'war', 'presidential', 'race', 'trump', 'ally', 'lean', 'sharp', 'attack', 'vice', 'president', 'kamala', 'harris', 'record', 'run', 'wave', 'stark', 'tv', 'spot', 'kamala', 'agenda', 'say', 'ad', 'refer', 'pronoun', 'transgender', 'non', 'binary', 'individual', 'newsom', 'call', 'ad', 'devastating', 'campaign', 'podcast', 'go', 'say', 'react', 'devastating', 'total', 'republican', 'advertiser', 'spend', 'million', 'ad', 'reference', 'transgender', 'policy', 'lgbtq', 'right', 'presidential', 'campaign', 'include', 'specific', 'reference', 'athletic', 'participation', 'accord', 'datum', 'ad', 'tracking', 'firm', 'adimpact', 'debate', 'spill', 'key', 'congressional', 'race', 'republican', 'candidate', 'echo', 'messaging', 'pro', 'trump', 'advertiser', 'ad', 'texas', 'gop', 'sen', 'ted', 'cruz', 'challenge', 'unsuccessfully', 'democratic', 'rep', 'colin', 'allre', 'year', 'feature', 'girl', 'play', 'school', 'sport', 'large', 'dark', 'shadow', 'loom', 'narrator', 'say', 'colin', 'allre', 'stop', 'man', 'compete', 'woman', 'sport', 'instead', 'vote', 'daughter', 'kind', 'man', 'response', 'criticism', 'allre', 'democrat', 'year', 'airwave', 'directly', 'rebut', 'attack', 'say', 'ad', 'want', 'boy', 'play', 'girl', 'sport', 'ridiculous', 'stuff', 'ted', 'cruz', 'say']",
9294f8e2-fba8-4bc7-8481-cfd3990413ea,pro,iowa becomes first us state to remove gender identity protections from its civil rights code,"['iowa', 'state', 'remove', 'gender', 'identity', 'protection', 'civil', 'right', 'code']",cnn,none listed (originally from the associated press),https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/28/us/iowa-governor-gender-identity-civil-rights-code/index.html,2/28/2025,"iowa became the first us state to remove gender identity protections from its civil rights code on friday when gov. kim reynolds signed into law a bill that opponents say will expose transgender people and other iowans to discrimination in all aspects of daily life.

the new law, which goes into effect july 1, follows several years of action from reynolds and iowa republicans to restrict transgender students’ use of such spaces as bathrooms and locker rooms, and their participation on sports teams, in an effort to protect people assigned female at birth. republicans say those policies cannot co-exist with a civil rights code that includes gender identity protections.

the law also creates explicit legal definitions of female and male based on their reproductive organs at birth, rejecting the idea that a person can transition to another gender. reynolds proposed a similar bill last year, but it didn’t make it to a vote of the full house or senate.

“women and men are not identical; they possess unique biological differences. that’s not controversial, it’s common sense,” reynolds said in a statement at the time. “it’s unfortunate that defining a woman in code has become necessary to protect spaces where women’s health, safety, and privacy are being threatened.” she added that such spaces included domestic violence shelters and rape crisis centers.

president donald trump signed an executive order on his first day in office to formalize a definition of the two sexes at the federal level, leading several republican-led legislatures to push for laws defining male and female. trump posted in support of the iowa bill on his truth social platform thursday after it got final approval from the iowa house and senate.

five house republicans joined all democrats in the house and senate in voting against the bill. iowa state rep. aime wichtendahl was the final democrat to speak before the vote, wiping away tears as she offered her personal story as a transgender woman, saying: “i transitioned to save my life.” “the purpose of this bill and the purpose of every anti-trans bill is to further erase us from public life and to stigmatize our existence,” wichtendahl said. “the sum total of every anti-trans and anti-lgbtq bill is to make our existence illegal.”

hundreds of lgbtq+ advocates streamed into the capitol rotunda on thursday waving signs reading “trans rights are human rights” and chanting slogans including, “no hate in our state!” there was a heavy police presence, with state troopers stationed around the rotunda. the few protesters who lingered for final passage of the bill were emotional. not every state includes gender identity in their civil rights code, but iowa is now the first in the u.s. to remove nondiscrimination protections based on gender identity, said logan casey, director of policy research at the movement advancement project, an lgbtq+ rights think tank. sexual orientation and gender identity were not originally included in the state’s civil rights act of 1965. they were added by the democratic-controlled legislature in 2007, also with the support of about a dozen republicans across the two chambers.

the house republican moving the bill thursday, rep. steven holt, said that if the legislature can add protections, it can remove them.

as of july 1, iowa’s civil rights law will protect against discrimination based on race, color, creed, sex, sexual orientation, religion, national origin or disability status.

advocacy groups promise to defend transgender rights, which may lead them to court.

keenan crow, director of policy and advocacy for lgbtq+ advocacy group one iowa, said the organization is still analyzing the text of the bill and that its vagueness makes it “hard to determine where the enforcement is going to come from.”

“we will pursue any legal options available to us,” crow said.","['iowa', 'state', 'remove', 'gender', 'identity', 'protection', 'civil', 'right', 'code', 'friday', 'gov', 'kim', 'reynolds', 'sign', 'law', 'bill', 'opponent', 'expose', 'transgend', 'people', 'iowan', 'discrimination', 'aspect', 'daily', 'life', 'new', 'law', 'go', 'effect', 'july', 'follow', 'year', 'action', 'reynold', 'iowa', 'republicans', 'restrict', 'transgender', 'student', 'use', 'space', 'bathroom', 'locker', 'room', 'participation', 'sport', 'team', 'effort', 'protect', 'people', 'assign', 'female', 'birth', 'republican', 'policy', 'co', 'exist', 'civil', 'right', 'code', 'include', 'gender', 'identity', 'protection', 'law', 'create', 'explicit', 'legal', 'definition', 'female', 'male', 'base', 'reproductive', 'organ', 'birth', 'reject', 'idea', 'person', 'transition', 'gender', 'reynold', 'propose', 'similar', 'bill', 'year', 'vote', 'house', 'senate', 'woman', 'man', 'identical', 'possess', 'unique', 'biological', 'difference', 'controversial', 'common', 'sense', 'reynold', 'say', 'statement', 'time', 'unfortunate', 'define', 'woman', 'code', 'necessary', 'protect', 'space', 'woman', 'health', 'safety', 'privacy', 'threaten', 'add', 'space', 'include', 'domestic', 'violence', 'shelter', 'rape', 'crisis', 'center', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'sign', 'executive', 'order', 'day', 'office', 'formalize', 'definition', 'sex', 'federal', 'level', 'lead', 'republican', 'lead', 'legislature', 'push', 'law', 'define', 'male', 'female', 'trump', 'post', 'support', 'iowa', 'bill', 'truth', 'social', 'platform', 'thursday', 'get', 'final', 'approval', 'iowa', 'house', 'senate', 'house', 'republicans', 'join', 'democrats', 'house', 'senate', 'vote', 'bill', 'iowa', 'state', 'rep', 'aime', 'wichtendahl', 'final', 'democrat', 'speak', 'vote', 'wipe', 'away', 'tear', 'offer', 'personal', 'story', 'transgender', 'woman', 'say', 'transition', 'save', 'life', 'purpose', 'bill', 'purpose', 'anti', 'trans', 'bill', 'erase', 'public', 'life', 'stigmatize', 'existence', 'wichtendahl', 'say', 'sum', 'total', 'anti', 'trans', 'anti', 'lgbtq', 'bill', 'existence', 'illegal', 'hundred', 'advocate', 'stream', 'capitol', 'rotunda', 'thursday', 'wave', 'sign', 'read', 'trans', 'right', 'human', 'right', 'chant', 'slogan', 'include', 'hate', 'state', 'heavy', 'police', 'presence', 'state', 'trooper', 'station', 'rotunda', 'protester', 'linger', 'final', 'passage', 'bill', 'emotional', 'state', 'include', 'gender', 'identity', 'civil', 'right', 'code', 'iowa', 'remove', 'nondiscrimination', 'protection', 'base', 'gender', 'identity', 'say', 'logan', 'casey', 'director', 'policy', 'research', 'movement', 'advancement', 'project', 'right', 'think', 'tank', 'sexual', 'orientation', 'gender', 'identity', 'originally', 'include', 'state', 'civil', 'right', 'act', 'add', 'democratic', 'control', 'legislature', 'support', 'dozen', 'republican', 'chamber', 'house', 'republican', 'move', 'bill', 'thursday', 'rep', 'steven', 'holt', 'say', 'legislature', 'add', 'protection', 'remove', 'july', 'iowa', 'civil', 'right', 'law', 'protect', 'discrimination', 'base', 'race', 'color', 'creed', 'sex', 'sexual', 'orientation', 'religion', 'national', 'origin', 'disability', 'status', 'advocacy', 'group', 'promise', 'defend', 'transgender', 'right', 'lead', 'court', 'keenan', 'crow', 'director', 'policy', 'advocacy', 'advocacy', 'group', 'iowa', 'say', 'organization', 'analyze', 'text', 'bill', 'vagueness', 'make', 'hard', 'determine', 'enforcement', 'go', 'come', 'pursue', 'legal', 'option', 'available', 'crow', 'say']",

five people were charged with second-degree murder last week in the death of sam nordquist, a 24-year-old transgender man whose body was found discarded in a field this month. authorities say nordquist died following repeated acts of violence and torture for more than a month by multiple people.

the conservative-led court is taking up the case amid actions by president donald trump targeting transgender people, including a ban on military service and an end to federal funding for gender-affirming care for transgender minors.

the justices also have heard arguments in a tennessee case over whether state bans on treating transgender minors violate the constitution. but they have yet to issue a decision.

colorado is among roughly half the states that prohibit the practice of trying to change a person’s sexual orientation or gender identity through counseling.

the issue is whether the law violates the speech rights of counselors. defenders of such laws argue that they regulate the conduct of professionals who are licensed by the state. the 10th u.s. circuit court of appeals in denver upheld the state law. the 11th u.s. circuit court of appeals in atlanta has struck down local local bans in florida.

in 2023, the court had turned away a similar challenge, despite a split among federal appeals courts that had weighed state bans and come to differing decisions.

at the time, three justices, samuel alito, brett kavanaugh and clarence thomas, said they would have taken on the issue. it takes four justices to grant review. the nine-member court does not typically reveal how justices vote at this stage of a case so it’s unclear who might have provided the fourth vote.


the case will be argued in the court’s new term, which begins in october. the appeal on behalf of kaley chiles, a counselor in colorado springs, was filed by alliance defending freedom, a conservative legal organization that has appeared frequently at the court in recent years in cases involving high-profile social issues.

chiles has had to turn away clients because of the law, adf lawyer jim campbell said monday on a conference call for reporters, though he declined to say how many.

chiles said the law, with potential fines of $5,000 and license suspension or even revocation, “interferes with my ability to serve my clients with integrity.”

one of adf’s earlier cases was a 5-4 decision in 2018 in which the justices ruled that california could not force state-licensed anti-abortion crisis pregnancy centers to provide information about abortion.

chiles’ lawyers leaned heavily on that decision in asking the court to take up her case. they wrote that chiles doesn’t “seek to ‘cure’ clients of same-sex attractions or to ‘change’ clients’ sexual orientation.”

in arguing for the court to reject the appeal, lawyers for colorado wrote that lawmakers acted to regulate professional conduct, “based on overwhelming evidence that efforts to change a child’s sexual orientation or gender identity are unsafe and ineffective.”","['supreme', 'court', 'agree', 'monday', 'case', 'colorado', 'decide', 'state', 'local', 'government', 'enforce', 'law', 'ban', 'conversion', 'therapy', 'child', 'conservative', 'lead', 'court', 'take', 'case', 'amid', 'action', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'target', 'transgender', 'people', 'include', 'ban', 'military', 'service', 'end', 'federal', 'funding', 'gender', 'affirm', 'care', 'transgender', 'minor', 'justice', 'hear', 'argument', 'tennessee', 'case', 'state', 'ban', 'treat', 'transgender', 'minor', 'violate', 'constitution', 'issue', 'decision', 'colorado', 'roughly', 'half', 'state', 'prohibit', 'practice', 'try', 'change', 'person', 'sexual', 'orientation', 'gender', 'identity', 'counseling', 'issue', 'law', 'violate', 'speech', 'right', 'counselor', 'defender', 'law', 'argue', 'regulate', 'conduct', 'professional', 'license', 'state', 'circuit', 'court', 'appeals', 'denver', 'uphold', 'state', 'law', 'circuit', 'court', 'appeals', 'atlanta', 'strike', 'local', 'local', 'ban', 'florida', 'court', 'turn', 'away', 'similar', 'challenge', 'despite', 'split', 'federal', 'appeal', 'court', 'weigh', 'state', 'ban', 'come', 'differ', 'decision', 'time', 'justice', 'samuel', 'alito', 'brett', 'kavanaugh', 'clarence', 'thomas', 'say', 'take', 'issue', 'take', 'justice', 'grant', 'review', 'member', 'court', 'typically', 'reveal', 'justice', 'vote', 'stage', 'case', 'unclear', 'provide', 'fourth', 'vote', 'case', 'argue', 'court', 'new', 'term', 'begin', 'october', 'appeal', 'behalf', 'kaley', 'chile', 'counselor', 'colorado', 'spring', 'file', 'alliance', 'defend', 'freedom', 'conservative', 'legal', 'organization', 'appear', 'frequently', 'court', 'recent', 'year', 'case', 'involve', 'high', 'profile', 'social', 'issue', 'chile', 'turn', 'away', 'client', 'law', 'adf', 'lawyer', 'jim', 'campbell', 'say', 'monday', 'conference', 'reporter', 'decline', 'chile', 'say', 'law', 'potential', 'fine', 'license', 'suspension', 'revocation', 'interfere', 'ability', 'serve', 'client', 'integrity', 'adf', 'early', 'case', 'decision', 'justice', 'rule', 'california', 'force', 'state', 'license', 'anti', 'abortion', 'crisis', 'pregnancy', 'center', 'provide', 'information', 'abortion', 'chile', 'lawyer', 'lean', 'heavily', 'decision', 'ask', 'court', 'case', 'write', 'chile', 'seek', 'cure', 'client', 'sex', 'attraction', 'change', 'client', 'sexual', 'orientation', 'argue', 'court', 'reject', 'appeal', 'lawyer', 'colorado', 'write', 'lawmaker', 'act', 'regulate', 'professional', 'conduct', 'base', 'overwhelming', 'evidence', 'effort', 'change', 'child', 'sexual', 'orientation', 'gender', 'identity', 'unsafe', 'ineffective']",
b05425b4-6bea-4d79-8a26-1bcbcff83327,pro,lawsuit aims to strike down lgbtq antidiscrimination protections in pennsylvania,"['lawsuit', 'aim', 'strike', 'lgbtq', 'antidiscrimination', 'protection', 'pennsylvania']",associated press,marc levy,https://apnews.com/article/transgender-pennsylvania-discrimination-sex-lawsuit-josh-shapiro-185bb0f3cadbbb8a1eb4e5de2a8d9bb4,3/7/2025,"two public school districts and several parents have sued pennsylvania in a bid to undo antidiscrimination protections for gay and transgender people, saying the state’s two-year-old regulation is illegal because it goes beyond what lawmakers intended or allowed.

the lawsuit comes amid a national debate over the rights of transgender high school athletes to compete in women’s sports, and was filed in the statewide commonwealth court late thursday.

if the lawsuit is successful, the pennsylvania human relations commission would no longer be able to investigate complaints about discrimination involving sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression. the plaintiffs’ lawyers also say a favorable ruling in court would bar transgender student athletes from competing in women’s high school sports in pennsylvania. the plaintiffs include two districts — south side area and knoch, both in western pennsylvania — and two republican state lawmakers, reps. aaron bernstine and barbara gleim, as well as three parents and seven students.

the lawsuit names gov. josh shapiro, a democrat, and the pennsylvania human relations commission, which investigates complaints about discrimination because of someone’s race, sex, religion, age or disability in housing, employment and public accommodations.

shapiro’s office said it had no immediate comment friday, and the commission did not respond to an inquiry about the lawsuit friday.


the lawsuit is aimed at the definition of sex discrimination, which the commission expanded by regulation to include sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression. the regulation was approved in late 2022 by a separate regulatory gatekeeper agency, and it took effect in 2023.

the plaintiffs contend that the state supreme court has interpreted the term “sex” as used in the pennsylvania constitution to mean either male or female. they also contend that the state legislature never gave permission to the human relations commission to write regulations expanding the legal definition of sex discrimination, making the regulation a violation of the legislature’s constitutional authority over lawmaking.

the commission has justified the expanded definition by saying that state courts have held that pennsylvania’s antidiscrimination laws are to be interpreted consistently with federal antidiscrimination law. the commission can negotiate settlements between parties or impose civil penalties, such as back pay or damages.

for years, democratic lawmakers tried to change the law to add the terms sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression to the portfolio of complaints that the human relations commission could investigate. every time, republican lawmakers blocked the effort.

shapiro, in the past, has backed the democrats’ legislation and in 2021 called gop-backed legislation to prohibit transgender athletes from playing women’s high school and college sports “cruel.”

most states have laws against discriminating against gay or transgender people in employment, housing and public accommodations or investigate such complaints, according to the human rights campaign, which advocates for equality for lgbtq people.","['public', 'school', 'district', 'parent', 'sue', 'pennsylvania', 'bid', 'undo', 'antidiscrimination', 'protection', 'gay', 'transgender', 'people', 'say', 'state', 'year', 'old', 'regulation', 'illegal', 'go', 'lawmaker', 'intend', 'allow', 'lawsuit', 'come', 'amid', 'national', 'debate', 'right', 'transgender', 'high', 'school', 'athlete', 'compete', 'woman', 'sport', 'file', 'statewide', 'commonwealth', 'court', 'late', 'thursday', 'lawsuit', 'successful', 'pennsylvania', 'human', 'relations', 'commission', 'long', 'able', 'investigate', 'complaint', 'discrimination', 'involve', 'sexual', 'orientation', 'gender', 'identity', 'gender', 'expression', 'plaintiff', 'lawyer', 'favorable', 'ruling', 'court', 'bar', 'transgender', 'student', 'athlete', 'compete', 'woman', 'high', 'school', 'sport', 'pennsylvania', 'plaintiff', 'include', 'district', 'south', 'area', 'knoch', 'western', 'pennsylvania', 'republican', 'state', 'lawmaker', 'rep', 'aaron', 'bernstine', 'barbara', 'gleim', 'parent', 'seven', 'student', 'lawsuit', 'name', 'gov', 'josh', 'shapiro', 'democrat', 'pennsylvania', 'human', 'relations', 'commission', 'investigate', 'complaint', 'discrimination', 'race', 'sex', 'religion', 'age', 'disability', 'housing', 'employment', 'public', 'accommodation', 'shapiro', 'office', 'say', 'immediate', 'comment', 'friday', 'commission', 'respond', 'inquiry', 'lawsuit', 'friday', 'lawsuit', 'aim', 'definition', 'sex', 'discrimination', 'commission', 'expand', 'regulation', 'include', 'sexual', 'orientation', 'gender', 'identity', 'gender', 'expression', 'regulation', 'approve', 'late', 'separate', 'regulatory', 'gatekeeper', 'agency', 'take', 'effect', 'plaintiff', 'contend', 'state', 'supreme', 'court', 'interpret', 'term', 'sex', 'pennsylvania', 'constitution', 'mean', 'male', 'female', 'contend', 'state', 'legislature', 'give', 'permission', 'human', 'relations', 'commission', 'write', 'regulation', 'expand', 'legal', 'definition', 'sex', 'discrimination', 'make', 'regulation', 'violation', 'legislature', 'constitutional', 'authority', 'lawmaking', 'commission', 'justify', 'expand', 'definition', 'say', 'state', 'court', 'hold', 'pennsylvania', 'antidiscrimination', 'law', 'interpret', 'consistently', 'federal', 'antidiscrimination', 'law', 'commission', 'negotiate', 'settlement', 'party', 'impose', 'civil', 'penalty', 'pay', 'damage', 'year', 'democratic', 'lawmaker', 'try', 'change', 'law', 'add', 'term', 'sexual', 'orientation', 'gender', 'identity', 'gender', 'expression', 'portfolio', 'complaint', 'human', 'relation', 'commission', 'investigate', 'time', 'republican', 'lawmaker', 'block', 'effort', 'shapiro', 'past', 'back', 'democrats', 'legislation', 'call', 'gop', 'back', 'legislation', 'prohibit', 'transgender', 'athlete', 'play', 'woman', 'high', 'school', 'college', 'sport', 'cruel', 'state', 'law', 'discriminate', 'gay', 'transgender', 'people', 'employment', 'housing', 'public', 'accommodation', 'investigate', 'complaint', 'accord', 'human', 'right', 'campaign', 'advocate', 'equality', 'lgbtq', 'people']",
6b65a8a4-b775-4435-9023-ce771d4c140d,pro,which us companies are pulling back on diversity initiatives?,"['company', 'pull', 'diversity', 'initiative']",associated press,none listed,https://apnews.com/article/dei-diversity-equity-inclusion-companies-lawsuits-2193ef0a864db968e6934f971f78e8f2,3/8/2025,"a growing number of prominent companies have scaled back or set aside the diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives that much of corporate america endorsed following the protests that accompanied the minneapolis police killing of george floyd, a black man, in 2020.

the changes have come in response to a campaign by conservative activists to target workplace programs in the courts and social media, and more recently, president donald trump’s executive orders aimed at upending dei policies in both the federal government and private sector.

dei policies typically are intended to root out systemic barriers to the advancement of historically marginalized groups in certain fields or roles. critics argue that some education, government and business programs are discriminatory because they single out participants based on factors such as race, gender and sexual orientation. they have targeted corporate sponsorships, employee-led affinity groups, programs aimed at steering contracts to minority or women-owned businesses, and goals that some companies established for increasing minority representation in leadership ranks. while hiring or promotion decisions based on race or gender is illegal under title vii of the 1964 civil rights act in most circumstances, companies say they are not doing that. instead, they say they aspire to diversify their workforce over time through policies like widening candidate pools for job openings.

these are some of the companies that have retreated from dei: uber
after an conducting an internal investigation that found rampant sexual harassment issues within its corporate office under its founder and former ceo travis kalanick, uber has been focused on overhauling its corporate culture since its current ceo dara khosrowshahi took over in 2017.

those changes had included a ramped-up commitment to diversity and inclusion as part of a commitment that the ride-hailing service highlighted in a section of its annual report for 2023.

but uber dropped its diversity and inclusion section from its 2024 annual report filed last month. and the word “diversity” doesn’t appear anywhere in its 135 pages.

uber didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment friday.

salesforce
salesforce ceo marc benioff once was on a crusade to inspire other corporate leaders to become social activists in a drive to fix a “train wreck” of inequality, but he has since toned down that message while pledging to work with president donald trump “to drive american success and prosperity for all.”

although benioff personally has remained an outspoken supporter of lgbtq+ rights, salesforce is no longer touting its diversity program. after carving out a section of its annual report filed last year to declare, “equality, diversity and inclusion equality is a core value at salesforce,” the san francisco excluded any discussion of diversity programs in its latest annual report filed march 5.

“while we don’t have representation goals, we remain committed to our value of equality,” salesforce said in a statement.

pepsi
pepsico confirmed that it’s ending some of its diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, even as rival coca-cola voiced support for its own inclusion efforts.

in a memo sent to employees, pepsico ceo ramon laguarta said the company will no longer set goals for minority representation in its managerial roles or supplier base. the company will also align its sponsorships to events and groups that promote business growth, he said.

laguarta wrote that inclusion remains important to pepsico, whose brands include gatorade, lay’s potato chips, doritos, mountain dew as well as pepsi. the purchase, new york-based company’s chief diversity officer will transition to a broader role focused on employee engagement, leadership development and ensuring an inclusive culture, he said.

goldman sachs
investment firm goldman sachs confirmed that it was dropping a requirement that forced ipo clients to include women and members of minority groups on their board of directors.

“as a result of legal developments related to board diversity requirements, we ended our formal board diversity policy,” said a goldman sachs spokesman in an email to the associated press. “we continue to believe that successful boards benefit from diverse backgrounds and perspectives, and we will encourage them to take this approach.”

goldman sachs said that it will still have a placement service that connects its clients with diverse candidates to serve on their boards. 
google
google rescinded a goal it had set in 2020 to increase representation of underrepresented groups among the company’s leadership team by 30% within five years. in a memo to employees, the company also said it was considering other changes in response to trump’s executive order aimed at prohibiting federal contractors from conducting dei practices that constitute “illegal discrimination.”

google’s parent company alphabet also signaled things were changing in its annual 10-k report filed with the securities and exchange commission. the report dropped a boilerplate sentence it has used since 2020 declaring that the company is “committed to making diversity, equity, and inclusion part of everything we do and to growing a workforce that is representative of the users we serve.”

target
the retailer said that changes to its “belonging at the bullseye” strategy would include ending a program it established to help black employees build meaningful careers, improve the experience of black shoppers and to promote black-owned businesses following floyd’s death in minneapolis, where target has its headquarters.

target, which operates nearly 2,000 stores nationwide and employs more than 400,000 people, said it also would conclude the diversity, equity and inclusion, or dei, goals it previously set in three-year cycles.

the goals included hiring and promoting more women and members of racial minority groups, and recruiting more diverse suppliers, including businesses owned by people of color, women, lgbtq+ people, veterans and people with disabilities.

target also will no longer participate in surveys designed to gauge the effectiveness of its actions, including an annual index compiled by the human rights campaign, a national lgbtq+ rights organization. target also said it would further evaluate corporate partnerships to ensure they’re connected directly to business objectives, but declined to share details.

meta platforms
the parent company of facebook and instagram said it was getting rid of its diversity, equity and inclusion program, which featured policies for hiring, training and picking vendors.

like other companies that announced similar changes before meta, the social media giant said it had been reviewing the program since the supreme court’s july 2023 ruling upending affirmative action in higher education.

citing an internal memo sent to employees, news website axios reported the menlo park, california-based tech giant said it would no longer have a team focused on diversity and inclusion and will instead “focus on how to apply fair and consistent practices that mitigate bias for all, no matter your background.” the change means the company will also end its “diverse slate approach” to hiring, which involved considering a diverse pool of candidates for every open position.

amazon
amazon said it was halting some of its dei programs, although it did not specify which ones. in a dec. 16 memo to employees, candi castleberry, a senior human resources executive, said the company has been “winding down outdated programs and materials, and we’re aiming to complete that by the end of 2024.”

“we also know there will always be individuals or teams who continue to do well-intentioned things that don’t align with our company-wide approach, and we might not always see those right away. but we’ll keep at it,” she wrote.

rather than “have individual groups build programs,” castleberry said, amazon is “focusing on programs with proven outcomes – and we also aim to foster a more truly inclusive culture.”

mcdonald’s
mcdonald’s said on jan. 6 that it would retire specific goals for achieving diversity at senior leadership levels. it also planned to end a program that encouraged its suppliers to develop diversity training and to increase the number of minority group members represented within their own leadership ranks.

mcdonald’s later said it was changing — but not eliminating — a scholarship program for latino students after it was sued by a group that opposes affirmative action. the program will now be open to any student who can demonstrate an impact on the latino community, the fast-food giant said. applicants no longer need to have at least one latino parent.

in an open letter to employees and franchisees, mcdonald’s senior leadership team said it remained committed to inclusion and believes that having a diverse workforce is a competitive advantage. the company said it would continue to publicly report its demographic information and spending on diverse-owned suppliers.

walmart
the world’s largest retailer confirmed in november that it would not be renewing a five-year commitment to a racial equity center set up in 2020 after the police killing of george floyd, and that it would stop participating in the hrc’s corporate equality index.

walmart also said it will better monitor its third-party marketplace to make sure items sold there do not include products aimed at lgbtq+ minors, including chest binders intended for transgender youth.

additionally, the company will no longer consider race and gender as a litmus test to improve diversity when it offers supplier contracts and it won’t be gathering demographic data when determining financing eligibility for those grants.

ford
ceo jim farley sent a memo to the automaker’s employees in august outlining changes to the company’s dei policies, including a decision to stop taking part in hrc’s corporate equality index.

ford, he wrote, had been looking at its policies for a year. the company doesn’t use hiring quotas or tie compensation to specific diversity goals but remains committed to “fostering a safe and inclusive workplace,” farley said.

“we will continue to put our effort and resources into taking care of our customers, our team, and our communities versus publicly commenting on the many polarizing issues of the day,” the memo said.

lowe’s
in august, lowe’s executive leadership said the company began “reviewing” its programs following the supreme court’s affirmative action ruling and decided to combine its employee resource groups into one umbrella organization. previously, the company had “individual groups representing diverse sections of our associate population.”

the retailer also will no longer participate in the hrc index, and will stop sponsoring and participating in events, such as festivals and parades, that are outside of its business areas.

harley-davidson
in a post on x in august, harley-davidson said the company would review all sponsorships and organizations it was affiliated with, and that all would have to be centrally approved. it said the company would focus exclusively on growing the sport of motorcycling and retaining its loyal riding community, in addition to supporting first responders, active military members and veterans.

the motorcycle maker said it would no longer participate in the ranking of workplace equality compiled by the hrc, and that its trainings would be related to the needs of the business and absent of socially motivated content.

harley-davidson also said it does not have hiring quotas and would no longer have supplier diversity spending goals.

brown-forman
the parent company of jack daniels also pulled out from participating in the hrc’s corporate equality index, among other changes. its leaders sent an email to employees in august saying the company launched its diversity and inclusion strategy in 2019, but since then “the world has evolved, our business has changed, and the legal and external landscape has shifted dramatically.”

the company said it would remove its quantitative workforce and supplier diversity ambitions, ensure incentives and employee goals were tied to business performance, and review training programs for consistency with a revised strategy.

“brown-forman continues to foster an inclusive work environment where everyone is welcomed, respected, and able to bring their best self to work,” spokeswoman elizabeth conway said in an email.

john deere
the farm equipment maker said in july that it would no longer sponsor “social or cultural awareness” events, and that it would audit all training materials “to ensure the absence of socially-motivated messages” in compliance with federal and local laws.

moline, illinois-based john deere added “the existence of diversity quotas and pronoun identification have never been and are not company policy.” but it noted that it would still continue to “track and advance” the diversity of the company.

tractor supply
the retailer in june said it was ending an array of corporate diversity and climate efforts, a move that came after weeks of online conservative backlash against the rural retailer.

tractor supply said it would be eliminating all of its dei roles while retiring current dei goals. the company added that it would “stop sponsoring non-business activities” such as pride festivals or voting campaigns — and no longer submit data for the hrc index.

the brentwood, tennessee-based company, which sells products ranging from farming equipment to pet supplies, also said that it would withdraw from its carbon emission goals to instead “focus on our land and water conservation efforts.”

the national black farmers association called on tractor supply’s president and ceo to step down shortly after the company’s announcement.","['grow', 'number', 'prominent', 'company', 'scale', 'set',

the judge’s ruling came in a lawsuit filed earlier this month on behalf of families with transgender or nonbinary children who allege their health care has already been compromised by the president’s orders.

a national group for family of lgbtq+ people and a doctors organization are also plaintiffs in the court challenge, one of more than 100 lawsuits opposing a slew of executive orders trump has issued as he seeks to reverse the policies of former president joe biden.

the preliminary injunction from u.s. district judge brendan hurson in baltimore, a biden nominee, keeps enforcement of the orders on hold while the case plays out, though the administration is expected to appeal.

several hospitals across the country halted such care for minors in the days after trump’s order to avoid losing federal funding.

another judge in seattle has also blocked the orders in four states in a separate lawsuit filed by a group of democratic-led states.","['federal', 'judge', 'extend', 'nationwide', 'block', 'tuesday', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'executive', 'order', 'halt', 'federal', 'funding', 'provider', 'gender', 'affirm', 'health', 'care', 'transgender', 'people', 'age', 'judge', 'ruling', 'come', 'lawsuit', 'file', 'early', 'month', 'behalf', 'family', 'transgender', 'nonbinary', 'child', 'allege', 'health', 'care', 'compromise', 'president', 'order', 'national', 'group', 'family', 'people', 'doctor', 'organization', 'plaintiff', 'court', 'challenge', 'lawsuit', 'oppose', 'slew', 'executive', 'order', 'trump', 'issue', 'seek', 'reverse', 'policy', 'president', 'joe', 'biden', 'preliminary', 'injunction', 'district', 'judge', 'brendan', 'hurson', 'baltimore', 'biden', 'nominee', 'keep', 'enforcement', 'order', 'hold', 'case', 'play', 'administration', 'expect', 'appeal', 'hospital', 'country', 'halt', 'care', 'minor', 'day', 'trump', 'order', 'avoid', 'lose', 'federal', 'funding', 'judge', 'seattle', 'block', 'order', 'state', 'separate', 'lawsuit', 'file', 'group', 'democratic', 'lead', 'state']",
c5938098-a1da-49bf-96c6-9bb20036ba1f,pro,bill to ban trans athletes from girls’ and women’s sports teams fails to advance in senate,"['bill', 'ban', 'trans', 'athlete', 'girl', 'woman', 'sport', 'team', 'fail', 'advance', 'senate']",associated press,stephen groves,https://apnews.com/article/transgender-athletes-congress-dfd81b15ebc09409f1bf6c8642f130f3,3/3/2025,"legislation that aimed to bar transgender women and girls nationwide from participating in school athletic competitions designated for female athletes failed to advance monday night in a divided senate as democrats stood united against an issue that republicans leveraged in last year’s elections.

a test vote on the bill failed to gain the 60 votes needed to advance in the chamber as senators stuck to party lines in a 51-45 vote tally.

the bill sought to determine title ix protections “based solely on a person’s reproductive biology and genetics at birth.” the vote came as republicans have homed in repeatedly on the social cause, casting it as an issue of ensuring athletic fairness for women and girls. president donald trump signed an executive order last month giving federal agencies wide latitude to ensure entities that receive federal funding abide by title ix in alignment with the administration’s view, which interprets “sex” as the gender someone was assigned at birth. still, republicans in congress have set their sights on enshrining that policy into law by amending the 1972 title ix law, which protects people from discrimination based on sex in education programs or activities that receive federal financial assistance.

“around the country we have seen men — biological men who identify as women — take up spaces and medals in athletics meant for actual women,” said senate majority leader john thune, r-s.d., adding, “this is a matter of fairness and equality.” the house had already passed similar legislation with only two democrats in support, but the setback for the bill in the senate showed the steep climb for any legislation that targets lgbtq people. democrats slammed the bill as both a distraction from more pressing issues and a federal overreach into local school decisions.

“what republicans are doing today is inventing a problem to stir up a culture war and divide people against each other,” sen. brian schatz, d-hawaii, said in a floor speech. sen. tammy baldwin, d-wis., said, “this is a decision for sports leagues to thoughtfully craft policy that actually takes seriously what is best for all players, not blanket mandates that will undoubtedly have unintended consequences for the safety of all students.” still, republicans nationwide appear determined to press the issue. during his presidential campaign, trump found that the topic resonated beyond the usual party lines. more than half the voters surveyed by ap votecast said support for transgender rights in government and society has gone too far.

following trump’s executive order, the ncaa changed its participation policy for transgender athletes to limit competition in women’s sports to athletes who were assigned female at birth.

in minnesota monday, the state house braced for a similar debate on a gop-backed bill that would apply to primary and secondary schools. ahead of the debate, several dozen supporters rallied on the steps of the state capitol in st. paul, framing the bill as protection for opportunities and safety for girls in sports, and ensuring that they have a level playing field.

democrats and lgbtq+ rights activists denounced the measure as bullying.

following the senate bill’s failure, kelley robinson, the president of human rights campaign, said in a statement: “every child should have the opportunity to experience the simple joys of being young and making memories with their friends. but bills like these send the message that transgender kids don’t deserve the same opportunities to thrive as their peers simply because of who they are.”","['legislation', 'aim', 'bar', 'transgender', 'woman', 'girl', 'nationwide', 'participate', 'school', 'athletic', 'competition', 'designate', 'female', 'athlete', 'fail', 'advance', 'monday', 'night', 'divided', 'senate', 'democrats', 'stand', 'unite', 'issue', 'republicans', 'leverage', 'year', 'election', 'test', 'vote', 'bill', 'fail', 'gain', 'vote', 'need', 'advance', 'chamber', 'senator', 'stick', 'party', 'line', 'vote', 'tally', 'bill', 'seek', 'determine', 'title', 'ix', 'protection', 'base', 'solely', 'person', 'reproductive', 'biology', 'genetic', 'birth', 'vote', 'come', 'republicans', 'home', 'repeatedly', 'social', 'cause', 'cast', 'issue', 'ensure', 'athletic', 'fairness', 'woman', 'girl', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'sign', 'executive', 'order', 'month', 'give', 'federal', 'agency', 'wide', 'latitude', 'ensure', 'entity', 'receive', 'federal', 'funding', 'abide', 'title', 'ix', 'alignment', 'administration', 'view', 'interpret', 'sex', 'gender', 'assign', 'birth', 'republicans', 'congress', 'set', 'sight', 'enshrine', 'policy', 'law', 'amend', 'title', 'ix', 'law', 'protect', 'people', 'discrimination', 'base', 'sex', 'education', 'program', 'activity', 'receive', 'federal', 'financial', 'assistance', 'country', 'see', 'man', 'biological', 'man', 'identify', 'woman', 'space', 'medal', 'athletic', 'mean', 'actual', 'woman', 'say', 'senate', 'majority', 'leader', 'john', 'thune', 'r', 'add', 'matter', 'fairness', 'equality', 'house', 'pass', 'similar', 'legislation', 'democrat', 'support', 'setback', 'bill', 'senate', 'show', 'steep', 'climb', 'legislation', 'target', 'lgbtq', 'people', 'democrats', 'slam', 'bill', 'distraction', 'pressing', 'issue', 'federal', 'overreach', 'local', 'school', 'decision', 'republican', 'today', 'invent', 'problem', 'stir', 'culture', 'war', 'divide', 'people', 'sen', 'brian', 'schatz', 'd', 'hawaii', 'say', 'floor', 'speech', 'sen', 'tammy', 'baldwin', 'd', 'wis', 'say', 'decision', 'sport', 'league', 'thoughtfully', 'craft', 'policy', 'actually', 'take', 'seriously', 'good', 'player', 'blanket', 'mandate', 'undoubtedly', 'unintended', 'consequence', 'safety', 'student', 'republicans', 'nationwide', 'appear', 'determined', 'press', 'issue', 'presidential', 'campaign', 'trump', 'find', 'topic', 'resonate', 'usual', 'party', 'line', 'half', 'voter', 'survey', 'ap', 'votecast', 'say', 'support', 'transgender', 'right', 'government', 'society', 'go', 'far', 'follow', 'trump', 'executive', 'order', 'ncaa', 'change', 'participation', 'policy', 'transgender', 'athlete', 'limit', 'competition', 'woman', 'sport', 'athlete', 'assign', 'female', 'birth', 'minnesota', 'monday', 'state', 'house', 'brace', 'similar', 'debate', 'gop', 'back', 'bill', 'apply', 'primary', 'secondary', 'school', 'ahead', 'debate', 'dozen', 'supporter', 'rally', 'step', 'state', 'capitol', 'st', 'paul', 'frame', 'bill', 'protection', 'opportunity', 'safety', 'girl', 'sport', 'ensure', 'level', 'playing', 'field', 'democrats', 'right', 'activist', 'denounce', 'measure', 'bully', 'follow', 'senate', 'bill', 'failure', 'kelley', 'robinson', 'president', 'human', 'right', 'campaign', 'say', 'statement', 'child', 'opportunity', 'experience', 'simple', 'joy', 'young', 'make', 'memory', 'friend', 'bill', 'like', 'send', 'message', 'transgender', 'kid', 'deserve', 'opportunity', 'thrive', 'peer', 'simply']",

the board of the pennsylvania interscholastic athletic association voted last week to remove a policy that had deferred to school principals to determine an athlete’s “gender” when “questioned or uncertain,” and instead approved one that officials said was designed to comply with trump’s order.

the new policy defers to principals to determine a student’s “sex” when “questioned or uncertain,” and adds a line that says that, in accordance with trump’s executive order, “schools are required to consult with their school solicitors relative to compliance with the order.”

associations in some other states, including maine, have signaled they may defy the president’s order, while others were taking a wait-and-see approach. trump signed the order on feb. 5, giving the federal government wide latitude to pull federal funding from entities that “deprive women and girls of fair athletic opportunities” by allowing transgender athletes to participate. legal challenges are expected.

in response to trump’s order, the ncaa revised its transgender participation policy to limit women’s college sports to athletes assigned as female at birth. the national association of intercollegiate athletics, a governing body for smaller schools, effectively banned transgender athletes in 2023 from women’s sports.

the number of transgender athletes competing at the high school and college level is believed to be small, but the topic became a campaign issue for trump last year as he declared his intent to “keep men out of women’s sports.”","['pennsylvania', 'govern', 'body', 'high', 'school', 'sport', 'change', 'policy', 'allow', 'transgender', 'athlete', 'compete', 'prep', 'athletic', 'follow', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'executive', 'order', 'board', 'pennsylvania', 'interscholastic', 'athletic', 'association', 'vote', 'week', 'remove', 'policy', 'defer', 'school', 'principal', 'determine', 'athlete', 'gender', 'question', 'uncertain', 'instead', 'approve', 'official', 'say', 'design', 'comply', 'trump', 'order', 'new', 'policy', 'defer', 'principal', 'determine', 'student', 'sex', 'question', 'uncertain', 'add', 'line', 'say', 'accordance', 'trump', 'executive', 'order', 'school', 'require', 'consult', 'school', 'solicitor', 'relative', 'compliance', 'order', 'association', 'state', 'include', 'maine', 'signal', 'defy', 'president', 'order', 'take', 'wait', 'approach', 'trump', 'sign', 'order', 'feb', 'give', 'federal', 'government', 'wide', 'latitude', 'pull', 'federal', 'funding', 'entity', 'deprive', 'woman', 'girl', 'fair', 'athletic', 'opportunity', 'allow', 'transgender', 'athlete', 'participate', 'legal', 'challenge', 'expect', 'response', 'trump', 'order', 'ncaa', 'revise', 'transgender', 'participation', 'policy', 'limit', 'woman', 'college', 'sport', 'athlete', 'assign', 'female', 'birth', 'national', 'association', 'intercollegiate', 'athletic', 'govern', 'body', 'small', 'school', 'effectively', 'ban', 'transgender', 'athlete', 'woman', 'sport', 'number', 'transgender', 'athlete', 'compete', 'high', 'school', 'college', 'level', 'believe', 'small', 'topic', 'campaign', 'issue', 'trump', 'year', 'declare', 'intent', 'man', 'woman', 'sport']",

in an internal va memo seen by npr friday, the va says it's rescinding directive 1341, which contains detailed guidance on the kinds of care transgender veterans can receive at va facilities. the policy had also directed healthcare providers to use pronouns veterans preferred, directed facilities to allow veterans to use bathrooms and be assigned rooms in accordance with their self-identified gender.

the internal memo said that the rescission of the directive ""does not affect existing clinical guidance"" and that the va ""affirms its commitment to provide care to all veterans."" after this story was published, va press secretary peter kasperowicz reached out to npr and denied that there was a policy change. he did not respond to npr's request to verify the authenticity of the internal memo that announced the policy change before or after publication of npr's story.

by saturday evening the memo was publicly available on the va web site.

in a statement saturday, rep. mark takano (d-ca) says the va is ""allowing veterans to be a pawn in the president's cruel political games.""

""va's decision to rescind its directive on providing healthcare for transgender and intersex veterans and va's announcement that it will be taking additional steps to undertake rulemaking to revise the care offered to transgender veterans are both shameful and cruel"" said takano, who is the highest ranking democrat on the house committee on veterans' affairs.

advocates had been bracing for the rescinding of the directive.

""it's disingenuous."" said lindsay church, executive director of advocacy group minority veterans of america. ""transgender veterans now have to ask themselves: 'is it worth it for me to get my care at va? am i safe to do so? what are the discriminatory factors that i will have to face in order for me to even go to the bathroom?'""

while transgender people make up a small percentage of the population, research suggests that they are more likely to serve in the military.

va's research shows that veterans who are sexual minorities — including lgbtqia, non-binary, intersex and other veterans — are more likely than average veterans to take their own lives; that figure is higher for transgender veterans. veterans have a higher average suicide rate than the general population.

in the internal memo, the va also said it will ""conduct a comprehensive review of care with respect to trans-identifying veterans and will undergo the rulemaking process to revise the medical benefits package as deemed necessary"".

church said advocates for these veterans are concerned the upcoming rule review could mean wholesale rollback on transgender health at the va.

the va currently offers gender-affirming healthcare that includes hormone treatment, prosthetic devices, as well as tools to help transgender veterans present as their gender identity.

while the va does not offer gender-affirming surgeries, the rescinded directive also stipulated that veterans could receive surgeries for other medical conditions that also happen to be gender-affirming, such as procedures mitigating cancer risks.

even before the va rescinded directive 1341 on friday, va staff members told npr that they have been receiving more calls from trans veterans worried about trusting their healthcare providers.

in the wake of the white house executive order that says it's now u.s. policy to ""recognize two sexes, male and female,"" the va has removed references to the group on some of its websites as well as in internal documents in its healthcare system.

the va has yet to respond to requests for comment on the new directive.

this is part of an ongoing move by the federal government to remove and alter national park service webpages related to lgbtq history. much of the censorship appears to be slipshod. some links to a ""theme study,"" containing dozens of pages of research about lgbtq u.s. history, are now dead; others work fine. the letters ""t"" and ""q,"" standing for ""transgender"" and ""queer,"" have been excised from the lgbtq acronym on some nps webpages but remain on others. and an nps page dedicated to the achievements of pauli murray, a civil rights activist and an episcopal priest, and that discusses her gender identity, no longer works, but a link that shows her family home remains active.

the nps has completely shut down several sites including one about philadelphia gay history, one that commemorated a now-closed black lgbtq bar in washington d.c. and a page about an eighteenth century american preacher who appears to have been gender nonconforming.

""these efforts to tamper with our history set an unacceptable precedent,"" said alan spears, a senior director at the national parks conservation association, in a statement. ""lgbtq+ history is history, period. it should remain represented at national parks and on the national park service website, so that people all over the world can learn about it from the best of the best in the history preservation business.""

""as mandated by law, dedicated national park service staff have poured more than one hundred years of work into preserving, protecting, and interpreting the stories that built our nation,"" the statement continued. ""by removing these educational and historical materials from public access, the administration is making it harder for national park service staff to fulfill their obligation to tell the stories of all americans and maintain an accurate account of history."" the national parks conservation association is a nonpartisan group established in 1919 to help protect the national parks. it called on the federal government to immediately restore the deleted material. in response to npr's request for comment, an nps spokesperson emailed, ""the national park service is implementing executive order 14168 and secretary's order 2416:  federal register: defending women from gender ideology extremism and restoring biological truth to the federal government [and] so 3416 - ending dei programs and gender ideology extremism.""

michael bronski, a harvard university history professor, noted that a disproportionate number of the erasures affected webpages about black activists and spaces. and he ruefully pointed out that one of the nps sites that deleted references to queer and transgender americans was about cold war attempts to purge lgbtq people from the government.

""i really see this as a symbolic attack,"" said bronski, who authored the 2011 book a queer history of the united states. ""the impulse behind it is to symbolically eradicate all of this progress: all of the government recognitions, gay rights, the presence of gay pride, flags on government buildings.""

""since you can't get rid of transpeople or gay people, or bisexual people, or queer people, you can try to get rid of documentation about us,"" he added.

450f79e3-3fd5-41b0-bdaa-ef52ddcd162e,anti,ncaa bars transgender athletes from women's sports after trump order,"['ncaa', 'bar', 'transgend', 'athlete', 'woman', 'sport', 'trump', 'order']",npr,none listed (originally from the associated press),https://www.npr.org/2025/02/07/g-s1-46938/ncaa-transgender-athletes-ban-trump,4/7/2025,"the ncaa changed its participation policy for transgender athletes on thursday, limiting competition in women's sports to athletes who were assigned female at birth.

the move came one day after president donald trump signed an executive order intended to ban transgender athletes from girls' and women's sports. the order gives federal agencies latitude to withhold federal funding from entities that do not abide by title ix in alignment with the trump administration's view, which interprets ""sex"" as the gender someone was assigned at birth.

the ncaa policy change is effective immediately and applies to all athletes regardless of previous eligibility reviews. the ncaa has some 1,100 member schools with more than 500,000 athletes, easily the largest governing body for college athletics in the u.s.

""we strongly believe that clear, consistent, and uniform eligibility standards would best serve today's student-athletes instead of a patchwork of conflicting state laws and court decisions,"" ncaa president charlie baker said. ""to that end, president trump's order provides a clear, national standard.""

the ncaa's decision was hailed by former kentucky swimmer riley gaines, a vocal advocate of banning transgender athletes from women's sports. gaines, who was at the white house signing ceremony with trump, was among more than a dozen college athletes who filed a lawsuit against the ncaa last year, accusing it of violating their title ix rights by allowing transgender woman lia thomas to compete at the national championships in 2022. ""i can't even begin to tell you how vindicating it feels knowing no girl will ever have to experience what my teammates and i did,"" gaines posted on x shortly after the ncaa announced the policy change.

the previous ncaa policy went into effect in 2022 and adopted a sport-by-sport approach, where transgender participation was determined by the policy of the sport's national governing body. in sports with no national governing body, that sport's international federation policy would be in place. if there is no international federation policy, previously established ioc policy criteria would take over. over the past year, however, transgender athletes have been targeted by critics who say their participation in women's sports is unfair and a potential safety risk. it became a major talking point in trump's re-election campaign even though there is believed to be a very small number of transgender athletes; baker last year said he knew of only 10 transgender athletes in the ncaa.

the ncaa's revised policy permits athletes assigned male at birth to practice with women's teams and receive benefits such as medical care. it it not uncommon, for example, for women's basketball teams to practice against fellow students who are male.

regardless of sex assigned at birth or gender identity, an athlete can practice and compete with a men's team assuming they meet all other ncaa eligibility requirements.

however, the ncaa said an athlete assigned female at birth who has begun hormone therapy (testosterone, for example) can practice with a women's team but cannot compete on a women's team without risking the team's eligibility for championships. member schools remain responsible for certifying athlete eligibility for practice and competition. the ncaa also said schools are subject to local, state and federal legislation and such legislation supersedes ncaa rules.

the ncaa policy change was announced hours after the trump administration said it was investigating potential civil rights violations at two universities and a high school sports league that allowed transgender athletes to compete on women's teams. the education department said it had opened reviews of san jose state university, the university of pennsylvania and the massachusetts interscholastic athletic association.

san jose state's women's volleyball team drew headlines last season over unconfirmed allegations that the roster included a transgender player. as for penn, three former teammates of thomas, the transgender swimmer, this week sued the ncaa, ivy league, harvard and the school over thomas's participation at conference and national championships, saying it violated title ix provisions.","['ncaa', 'change', 'participation', 'policy', 'transgender', 'athlete', 'thursday', 'limit', 'competition', 'woman', 'sport', 'athlete', 'assign', 'female', 'birth', 'come', 'day', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'sign', 'executive', 'order', 'intend', 'ban', 'transgender', 'athlete', 'girl', 'woman', 'sport', 'order', 'give', 'federal', 'agency', 'latitude', 'withhold', 'federal', 'funding', 'entity', 'abide', 'title', 'ix', 'alignment', 'trump', 'administration', 'view', 'interpret', 'sex', 'gender', 'assign', 'birth', 'ncaa', 'policy', 'change', 'effective', 'immediately', 'apply', 'athlete', 'regardless', 'previous', 'eligibility', 'review', 'ncaa', 'member', 'school', 'athlete', 'easily', 'large', 'governing', 'body', 'college', 'athletic', 'strongly', 'believe', 'clear', 'consistent', 'uniform', 'eligibility', 'standard', 'well', 'serve', 'today', 'student', 'athlete', 'instead', 'patchwork', 'conflict', 'state', 'law', 'court', 'decision', 'ncaa', 'president', 'charlie', 'baker', 'say', 'end', 'president', 'trump', 'order', 'provide', 'clear', 'national', 'standard', 'ncaa', 'decision', 'hail', 'kentucky', 'swimmer', 'riley', 'gaine', 'vocal', 'advocate', 'ban', 'transgender', 'athlete', 'woman', 'sport', 'gaine', 'white', 'house', 'signing', 'ceremony', 'trump', 'dozen', 'college', 'athlete', 'file', 'lawsuit', 'ncaa', 'year', 'accuse', 'violate', 'title', 'ix', 'right', 'allow', 'transgender', 'woman', 'lia', 'thomas', 'compete', 'national', 'championship', 'begin', 'tell', 'vindicating', 'feel', 'know', 'girl', 'experience', 'teammate', 'gaine', 'post', 'x', 'shortly', 'ncaa', 'announce', 'policy', 'change', 'previous', 'ncaa', 'policy', 'go', 'effect', 'adopt', 'sport', 'sport', 'approach', 'transgender', 'participation', 'determine', 'policy', 'sport', 'national', 'governing', 'body', 'sport', 'national', 'governing', 'body', 'sport', 'international', 'federation', 'policy', 'place', 'international', 'federation', 'policy', 'previously', 'establish', 'ioc', 'policy', 'criterion', 'past', 'year', 'transgender', 'athlete', 'target', 'critic', 'participation', 'woman', 'sport', 'unfair', 'potential', 'safety', 'risk', 'major', 'talking', 'point', 'trump', 'election', 'campaign', 'believe', 'small', 'number', 'transgender', 'athlete', 'baker', 'year', 'say', 'know', 'transgender', 'athlete', 'ncaa', 'ncaa', 'revised', 'policy', 'permit', 'athlete', 'assign', 'male', 'birth', 'practice', 'woman', 'team', 'receive', 'benefit', 'medical', 'care', 'uncommon', 'example', 'woman', 'basketball', 'team', 'practice', 'fellow', 'student', 'male', 'regardless', 'sex', 'assign', 'birth', 'gender', 'identity', 'athlete', 'practice', 'compete', 'man', 'team', 'assume', 'meet', 'ncaa', 'eligibility', 'requirement', 'ncaa', 'say', 'athlete', 'assign', 'female', 'birth', 'begin', 'hormone', 'therapy', 'testosterone', 'example', 'practice', 'woman', 'team', 'compete', 'woman', 'team', 'risk', 'team', 'eligibility', 'championship', 'member', 'school', 'remain', 'responsible', 'certify', 'athlete', 'eligibility', 'practice', 'competition', 'ncaa', 'say', 'school', 'subject', 'local', 'state', 'federal', 'legislation', 'legislation', 'supersede', 'ncaa', 'rule', 'ncaa', 'policy', 'change', 'announce', 'hour', 'trump', 'administration', 'say', 'investigate', 'potential', 'civil', 'right', 'violation', 'university', 'high', 'school', 'sport', 'league', 'allow', 'transgender', 'athlete', 'compete', 'woman', 'team', 'education', 'department', 'say', 'open', 'review', 'san', 'jose', 'state', 'university', 'university', 'pennsylvania', 'massachusetts', 'interscholastic', 'athletic', 'association', 'san', 'jose', 'state', 'woman', 'volleyball', 'team', 'draw', 'headline', 'season', 'unconfirmed', 'allegation', 'roster', 'include', 'transgender', 'player', 'penn', 'teammate', 'thomas', 'transgender', 'swimmer', 'week', 'sue', 'ncaa', 'ivy', 'league', 'harvard', 'school', 'thomas', 'participation', 'conference', 'national', 'championship', 'say', 'violate', 'title', 'ix', 'provision']",

juana summers, host:

south carolina congresswoman nancy mace, a republican, is leading an effort in congress to ban transgender women from using facilities like bathrooms and locker rooms that do not correspond with the sex they were assigned at birth. this push comes after the election of democrat sarah mcbride of delaware. she will be the first openly transgender woman to serve in the house. npr's elena moore is here to talk about how this is all unfolding. hi there.

elena moore, byline: hey there.

summers: so elena, can you just start by telling us what exactly congresswoman mace is proposing?

moore: yeah. she has two different proposals right now. the first is a measure to bar transgender women from entering women's bathrooms in the capitol. and then today she followed up with legislation that would expand those limitations to all federal property across the country. and mace is being direct about why she's doing this. i was in a group of reporters yesterday that asked if this effort is in response to mcbride coming to congress.

(soundbite of archived recording)

nancy mace: yes, and absolutely, and then some. i'm absolutely, 100%, going to stand in the way of any man who wants to be in a women's restroom, in our locker rooms, in our changing rooms. i will be there, fighting you every step of the way.

moore: and there, juana, she is referring to mcbride as a man. mace says the effort is about protecting women's rights. she's been public about being a survivor of sexual abuse and says that her experience is part of the reason she's working on this.

summers: ok. we know that republicans control the house. they hold a narrow majority. how likely is it, though, that either of the things that mace is proposing will actually pass?

moore: house speaker mike johnson, who is a staunch conservative, tried to toe the line on this a bit yesterday, calling for everyone to be treated with respect. today, he made a stronger statement, saying that facilities in the capitol and house office buildings are, quote, ""reserved for individuals of that biological sex."" so i asked mace about that move today, and here's what she said.

mace: i fully support his statement. i fully support his policy. does that stand the test of time? i want to make sure that it does.

moore: you know, and she said she's still lobbying for the change in rules for the capitol to be made official.

summers: and what about sarah mcbride, the delaware representative-elect? how has she responded to all of this?

moore: yeah. i mean, in general, mcbride hasn't engaged a whole lot. she put out a statement on x a few days ago saying she sees this as a distraction by republicans, and she's focused on policy instead of, quote, ""manufacturing culture wars."" but today, after johnson's move to informally, you know, bar her from using those facilities at her soon-to-be workplace, mcbride put out another statement saying she plans to follow johnson's rules, even though she disagrees with them. and, you know, she kind of extended an olive branch to her future colleagues, saying, quote, ""each of us were sent here because voters saw something in us that they value."" and she went on to say she looks forward to seeing those qualities in every member come january.

summers: transgender issues have come up quite a bit in republican politics recently. help us understand - how does mace's effort fit into that larger conversation?

moore: well, president-elect donald trump has spent millions of dollars on campaign ads saying vice president kamala harris is, quote, ""for they/them"" - you know? - and it was about her position on gender-affirming health care. but anti-trans messaging has become part of a broader republican political strategy. now it's also playing out within the halls of congress.

summers: that's npr's elena moore. thank you.

moore: thank you, juana.","['rep', 'nancy', 'mace', 'r', 'introduce', 'bill', 'ban', 'transgender', 'woman', 'facility', 'federal', 'property', 'like', 'bathroom', 'locker', 'room', 'correspond', 'sex', 'assign', 'birth', 'juana', 'summer', 'host', 'south', 'carolina', 'congresswoman', 'nancy', 'mace', 'republican', 'lead', 'effort', 'congress', 'ban', 'transgender', 'woman', 'facility', 'like', 'bathroom', 'locker', 'room', 'correspond', 'sex', 'assign', 'birth', 'push', 'come', 'election', 'democrat', 'sarah', 'mcbride', 'delaware', 'openly', 'transgend', 'woman', 'serve', 'house', 'npr', 'elena', 'moore', 'talk', 'unfold', 'hi', 'elena', 'moore', 'byline', 'hey', 'summer', 'elena', 'start', 'tell', 'exactly', 'congresswoman', 'mace', 'propose', 'moore', 'yeah', 'different', 'proposal', 'right', 'measure', 'bar', 'transgender', 'woman', 'enter', 'woman', 'bathroom', 'capitol', 'today', 'follow', 'legislation', 'expand', 'limitation', 'federal', 'property', 'country', 'mace', 'direct', 'group', 'reporter', 'yesterday', 'ask', 'effort', 'response', 'mcbride', 'come', 'congress', 'soundbite', 'archived', 'recording', 'nancy', 'mace', 'yes', 'absolutely', 'absolutely', 'go', 'stand', 'way', 'man', 'want', 'woman', 'restroom', 'locker', 'room', 'change', 'room', 'fight', 'step', 'way', 'moore', 'juana', 'refer', 'mcbride', 'man', 'mace', 'say', 'effort', 'protect', 'woman', 'right', 'public', 'survivor', 'sexual', 'abuse', 'say', 'experience', 'reason', 'work', 'summer', 'ok', 'know', 'republicans', 'control', 'house', 'hold', 'narrow', 'majority', 'likely', 'thing', 'mace', 'propose', 'actually', 'pass', 'moore', 'house', 'speaker', 'mike', 'johnson', 'staunch', 'conservative', 'try', 'toe', 'line', 'bit', 'yesterday', 'call', 'treat', 'respect', 'today', 'strong', 'statement', 'say', 'facility', 'capitol', 'house', 'office', 'building', 'quote', 'reserve', 'individual', 'biological', 'sex', 'ask', 'mace', 'today', 'say', 'mace', 'fully', 'support', 'statement', 'fully', 'support', 'policy', 'stand', 'test', 'time', 'want', 'sure', 'moore', 'know', 'say', 'lobby', 'change', 'rule', 'capitol', 'official', 'summer', 'sarah', 'mcbride', 'delaware', 'representative', 'elect', 'respond', 'moore', 'yeah', 'mean', 'general', 'mcbride', 'engage', 'lot', 'statement', 'x', 'day', 'ago', 'say', 'see', 'distraction', 'republicans', 'focus', 'policy', 'instead', 'quote', 'manufacture', 'culture', 'war', 'today', 'johnson', 'informally', 'know', 'bar', 'facility', 'soon', 'workplace', 'mcbride', 'statement', 'say', 'plan', 'follow', 'johnson', 'rule', 'disagree', 'know', 'kind', 'extend', 'olive', 'branch', 'future', 'colleague', 'say', 'quote', 'send', 'voter', 'see', 'value', 'go', 'look', 'forward', 'see', 'quality', 'member', 'come', 'january', 'summer', 'transgender', 'issue', 'come', 'bit', 'republican', 'politic', 'recently', 'help', 'understand', 'mace', 'effort', 'fit', 'large', 'conversation', 'moore', 'president', 'elect', 'donald', 'trump', 'spend', 'million', 'dollar', 'campaign', 'ad', 'say', 'vice', 'president', 'kamala', 'harris', 'quote', 'know', 'position', 'gender', 'affirm', 'health', 'care', 'anti', 'trans', 'messaging', 'broad', 'republican', 'political', 'strategy', 'play', 'hall', 'congress', 'summer', 'npr', 'elena', 'moore', 'thank', 'moore', 'thank', 'juana']",
224bf3f5-92d0-4c17-932a-ba0bad1af858,pro,arts groups sue nea for new 'gender ideology'-related grant restrictions,"['arts', 'group', 'sue', 'nea', 'new', 'gender', 'grant', 'restriction']",npr,chloe veltman,https://www.npr.org/2025/03/06/nx-s1-5320245/lawsuit-nea-gender-ideology-restrictions-trump-executive-order,3/8/2025,"arts groups who make or support work focused on lgbtq+ people and issues have sued the national endowment for the arts (nea) in response to new rules imposed by the trump administration requiring that grant applicants agree not to promote ""gender ideology"" in their work.

the american civil liberties union (aclu) filed the suit on thursday on behalf of rhode island latino arts, national queer theater, the theater offensive, and the theatre communications group in u.s. district court for the district of rhode island.

a day later, in response to the legal challenge, the nea agreed to remove their requirement forcing artists to certify they will not ""promote gender ideology"" in their applications to secure federal funding — at least until the resolution of a legal challenge — but has not yet signaled it would remove its applicant eligibility requirement to comply with the trump order. the aclu suit seeks to stop the federal agency that provides grants to arts organizations nationwide from implementing executive order 14168, which president donald trump signed on jan. 20. as a result of the order, titled ""defending women from gender ideology extremism and restoring biological truth to the federal government,"" the nea has asked grant applicants to certify that they will not use federal funds to ""promote gender ideology.""

the white house has said ""gender ideology includes the idea that there is a vast spectrum of genders that are disconnected from one's sex.""

about 1.3 million adults in the u.s. identify as transgender or gender nonconforming, and as many as 5 million americans may be intersex, according to a brief published in january by the williams institute, a think tank at ucla law school.

the nea agreed on friday to remove the requirement forcing artists to certify they will not ""promote gender ideology"" in their funding applications while the outcome of the case is pending.

""no later than march 11, 2025, senior leadership at the nea will approve the removal of the new language requiring compliance with e.o. 14168 in its assurance of compliance until the conclusion of this litigation,"" wrote nea deputy chair for management and budget ann eilers in a declaration shared by the aclu with npr. ""the nea intends to no longer require applicants to certify their compliance with e.o. 14168 while the outcome of this litigation is pending.""

it's a race against the clock: the lawsuit comes just three weeks ahead of the nea's present funding cycle deadline on mar. 24, leaving arts groups wondering if their applications will succeed — or whether they can apply for funding at all.

""this is an important development because our understanding is that many artists and arts organizations had decided not to apply this round at all because they objected to and/or feared having to make the certification,"" said aclu lead counsel vera eidelman in an email to npr.

in an interview with npr, eidelman said the nea's ""gender ideology"" prohibition is unconstitutional under the first and fifth amendments. she said it also violates the nea's governing statute.

"" this new prohibition runs directly counter to the point of the nea, and to the point of art in general, which is to explore ideas, explore the diversity of human experience,"" eidelman said. ""forcing artists to be a mouthpiece for government views really runs counter to that.""

""it is a cruel irony that we may now be ineligible for funding because our so-called 'gender ideology' is being targeted by the u.s. government,"" said adam odsess-rubin, founding artistic director of the national queer theater, in an online statement. the new york-based company is seeking funding for its upcoming annual criminal queerness festival focusing on plays by dramatists who hail from countries with strong anti-lgbtq+ laws. ""these new requirements threaten the expression of not just our organization, but artists around the world whose identities have been criminalized."" the national queer theater was offered a grant for 2025 but the award is ""pending processing.""

the nea did not respond to a request for comment.

the agency has been the target of protests for imposing this and other restrictions falling under trump's executive orders.

it recently had to dial back a different executive order-related rule asking grant applicants to certify that they, ""will not operate any programs promoting 'diversity, equity, and inclusion' (dei) that violate any applicable federal anti-discrimination laws, in accordance with executive order no. 14173"" after the national association of diversity officers in higher education and other groups sued the trump administration last month and won.

the nea was not involved in that lawsuit. but like many other federal agencies, it subsequently had to update its assurance of compliance. the arts agency now states that it ""is not currently requiring any grantee or contractor to make any 'certification' or other representation pursuant to executive order no. 14173.""

eidelman said her team has asked the court for an expedited hearing and to issue a preliminary injunction or a temporary restraining order. a hearing date is scheduled for march 18.

however, the nea has not yet agreed to remove its eligibility criteria.

""even though the nea has agreed that no one has to certify they won't use funds in this way, applicants still won't get an nea award if the government thinks their project will promote ""gender ideology,'"" eidelman said. ""that's the part we're still asking the court to block before march 24, when people must submit the specifics of their projects.""

""we are thrilled with yesterday's victory,"" said giselle byrd, executive director of the theater offensive. ""with this accomplishment, we must remember: the battle is not won.""","['art', 'group', 'support', 'work', 'focus', 'people', 'issue', 'sue', 'national', 'endowment', 'art', 'nea', 'response',

2df05280-d88b-450e-a17c-afdf8b95ed3a,pro,pentagon plans to begin removing trans service members from the military next month,"['pentagon', 'plan', 'begin', 'remove', 'trans', 'service', 'member', 'military', 'month']",npr,scott neuman,https://www.npr.org/2025/02/27/g-s1-51057/transgender-soldiers-military-ban-trump,3/1/2025,"the pentagon has directed that service members and recruits with gender dysphoria be separated from the u.s. military in accordance with an executive order issued a month ago by president trump. a memo made public on wednesday from defense secretary pete hegseth's office said service members or applicants for military service who have ""a current diagnosis or history of, or exhibit symptoms consistent with, gender dysphoria"" are ""incompatible"" with u.s. military service.

the move comes after the president issued an executive order on jan. 27 ordering the policy change and identifying gender dysphoria as incompatible with the government's ""high standards for troop readiness, lethality, cohesion, honesty, humility, uniformity, and integrity.""

the pentagon's policy directive calls for establishing procedures within 30 days to identify service members with gender dysphoria or a history of it to ""begin separation actions."" it said that exceptions could be made on a case-by-case basis if the government deems an ""interest in accessing the applicant that directly supports warfighting capabilities"" or if a service member demonstrates 36 consecutive months of ""stability"" in their sex ""without clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.""

in a statement sent to npr, sparta, an advocacy group for transgender service members and veterans, said that trans soldiers have served ""openly and honorably"" in the u.s. armed forces for nearly a decade.

""thousands of transgender troops are currently serving, and are fully qualified for the positions in which they serve,"" the statement said. ""no policy will ever erase transgender americans' contribution to history, warfighting, or military excellence.""

the pentagon memo further states that ""the department only recognizes two sexes: male and female. an individual's sex is immutable, unchanging during a person's life."" it also says: ""pronoun usage when referring to service members must reflect a service member's sex. in keeping with good order and discipline, salutations (e.g., addressing a senior officer as ""sir"" or ""ma'am"") must also reflect an individual's sex."" last month's executive order from the white house came as no surprise given that trump issued a series of tweets in 2017, during his first term, effectively banning transgender people from serving in the military. that policy was subsequently reversed by the biden administration. trump had also repeatedly spoken of his plans to restore the ban on trans service members on the campaign trail ahead of the 2024 election.

there are about 1.3 million military service personnel. palm center, a research institute that focused on studying and advocating for lgbtq+ inclusion within the u.s. military, estimated in 2018 that the number of transgender troops was about 14,700. in an email to npr, the department of defense said currently 4,240 active-duty service members, guard and reserve had been diagnosed with gender dysphoria. in response to the pentagon's plan, a coalition of 21 attorneys general from across the country filed a friend-of-the-court brief on wednesday to block implementation of the ban, which new york attorney general letitia james, in a statement, said ""cruelly targets the transgender americans who have dedicated their lives to protecting our freedoms.""

""i want all transgender service members and veterans to know that we see you, we respect you, and we will always fight for you. your service is invaluable, and we will not allow this bigoted attack to diminish your service to our country,"" james said. in addition to new york, attorneys general from arizona, california, colorado, connecticut, delaware, hawaii, illinois, maine, maryland, massachusetts, michigan, minnesota, nevada, new jersey, north carolina, oregon, rhode island, vermont, washington and wisconsin signed on to the brief.","['pentagon', 'direct', 'service', 'member', 'recruit', 'gender', 'dysphoria', 'separate', 'military', 'accordance', 'executive', 'order', 'issue', 'month', 'ago', 'president', 'trump', 'memo', 'public', 'wednesday', 'defense', 'secretary', 'pete', 'hegseth', 'office', 'say', 'service', 'member', 'applicant', 'military', 'service', 'current', 'diagnosis', 'history', 'exhibit', 'symptom', 'consistent', 'gender', 'dysphoria', 'incompatible', 'military', 'service', 'come', 'president', 'issue', 'executive', 'order', 'jan', 'order', 'policy', 'change', 'identify', 'gender', 'dysphoria', 'incompatible', 'government', 'high', 'standard', 'troop', 'readiness', 'lethality', 'cohesion', 'honesty', 'humility', 'uniformity', 'integrity', 'pentagon', 'policy', 'directive', 'call', 'establish', 'procedure', 'day', 'identify', 'service', 'member', 'gender', 'dysphoria', 'history', 'begin', 'separation', 'action', 'say', 'exception', 'case', 'case', 'basis', 'government', 'deem', 'interest', 'access', 'applicant', 'directly', 'support', 'warfighting', 'capability', 'service', 'member', 'demonstrate', 'consecutive', 'month', 'stability', 'sex', 'clinically', 'significant', 'distress', 'impairment', 'social', 'occupational', 'important', 'area', 'function', 'statement', 'send', 'npr', 'sparta', 'advocacy', 'group', 'transgender', 'service', 'member', 'veteran', 'say', 'trans', 'soldier', 'serve', 'openly', 'honorably', 'armed', 'force', 'nearly', 'decade', 'thousand', 'transgender', 'troop', 'currently', 'serve', 'fully', 'qualified', 'position', 'serve', 'statement', 'say', 'policy', 'erase', 'transgend', 'americans', 'contribution', 'history', 'warfighting', 'military', 'excellence', 'pentagon', 'memo', 'state', 'department', 'recognize', 'sex', 'male', 'female', 'individual', 'sex', 'immutable', 'unchanging', 'person', 'life', 'say', 'pronoun', 'usage', 'refer', 'service', 'member', 'reflect', 'service', 'member', 'sex', 'keep', 'good', 'order', 'discipline', 'salutation', 'address', 'senior', 'officer', 'sir', 'reflect', 'individual', 'sex', 'month', 'executive', 'order', 'white', 'house', 'come', 'surprise', 'give', 'trump', 'issue', 'series', 'tweet', 'term', 'effectively', 'ban', 'transgender', 'people', 'serve', 'military', 'policy', 'subsequently', 'reverse', 'biden', 'administration', 'trump', 'repeatedly', 'speak', 'plan', 'restore', 'ban', 'trans', 'service', 'member', 'campaign', 'trail', 'ahead', 'election', 'million', 'military', 'service', 'personnel', 'palm', 'center', 'research', 'institute', 'focus', 'study', 'advocate', 'inclusion', 'military', 'estimate', 'number', 'transgender', 'troop', 'email', 'npr', 'department', 'defense', 'say', 'currently', 'active', 'duty', 'service', 'member', 'guard', 'reserve', 'diagnose', 'gender', 'dysphoria', 'response', 'pentagon', 'plan', 'coalition', 'attorney', 'general', 'country', 'file', 'friend', 'court', 'brief', 'wednesday', 'block', 'implementation', 'ban', 'new', 'york', 'attorney', 'general', 'letitia', 'james', 'statement', 'say', 'cruelly', 'target', 'transgender', 'americans', 'dedicate', 'life', 'protect', 'freedom', 'want', 'transgender', 'service', 'member', 'veteran', 'know', 'respect', 'fight', 'service', 'invaluable', 'allow', 'bigoted', 'attack', 'diminish', 'service', 'country', 'james', 'say', 'addition', 'new', 'york', 'attorney', 'general', 'arizona', 'california', 'colorado', 'connecticut', 'delaware', 'hawaii', 'illinois', 'maine', 'maryland', 'massachusetts', 'michigan', 'minnesota', 'nevada', 'new', 'jersey', 'north', 'carolina', 'oregon', 'rhode', 'island', 'vermont', 'washington', 'wisconsin', 'sign', 'brief']",
3b5b9b1f-2114-40fc-8ef0-27f169758d3d,pro,"trump's passport policy leaves trans, intersex americans in the lurch","['trump', 'passport', 'policy', 'leave', 'trans', 'intersex', 'americans', 'lurch']",npr,jaclyn diaz,https://www.npr.org/2025/02/21/nx-s1-5300880/trump-passport-policy-trans-gender-intersex-nonbinary,2/21/2025,"louie figured he was taking a gamble when he submitted his passport application after president trump's inauguration.

he had a passport, which was valid for another two years. but at the end of december, a new york state court approved louie's request to change his name and gender marker. as a result, he needed a new passport — regardless of who was in office. louie asked npr to identify him by his first name because he fears harassment and retaliation at work.

louie, 24, identifies as transmasculine. at the end of 2024 and early january, he changed his driver's license and social security card to reflect the female-to-male gender marker update. it went smoothly, he told npr.

the trouble started in january, when he submitted his application for a new passport — just hours after trump took office on jan. 20.

the same day, trump issued an executive order stating that the federal government recognizes only two sexes, male and female. that led the state department to eliminate the x gender as an option and to suspend its policy allowing transgender, intersex and nonbinary people to update the sex field of their passports.

this executive order has upended the lives of individuals in prisons, at schools, seeking health care and in sports. it's now disrupting the lives of some trans, nonbinary and intersex people when they travel.

an estimated 1.3 million adults in the u.s. identify as transgender or gender nonconforming, and as many as 5 million americans may be intersex, according to a brief published last month from the williams institute, a think tank at ucla law school that researches sexual orientation and gender identity. those who spoke to npr for this story say the policy change is yet another example of the trump administration's persecution of the lgbtq+ community by creating new barriers in their daily lives.

the changes resulting from the executive order also mean that the gender identity of trans, nonbinary and intersex people won't be reflected in official documents, they say, forcing them to ""out"" themselves every time they present their passports — heightening their distress and fear and adding unpredictable logistical and safety challenges for travel and even everyday life.

""as a transgender person in this country … this fight for our freedom, our recognition, our ability to just live our lives, this isn't new,"" says westley ebling, who identifies as a transmasculine nonbinary person who faced issues getting a new passport recently. ""but this scale of attacks is just horrid. it has been a really hard time, to just feel that a country is so against you just for trying to live."" passport applications thrown into disarray
about a week after trump signed the order, secretary of state marco rubio suspended  passport applications of americans who chose x as their gender or who were trying to update their document's gender marker. now, under new policies, the state department will only issue passports that say male or female and that match the applicant's sex at birth. the state department did not respond to npr's questions about the new policies and their enforcement. npr spoke to lgbtq+ advocates as well as seven people who identify as trans, nonbinary or intersex who have been directly impacted by the changed passport policy or who have put plans to apply for a new passport and to travel on hold as a result of the confusing new rules.

in louie's case, he received a new passport with the correct name change. but the gender marker was still ""female,"" like his old passport. louie says he wasn't surprised, given the state department's policy changes, but is still upset and frustrated and unsure what it means for him. (euphoria actress hunter schafer shared on tiktok that she also received a new passport that reflected her sex assigned at birth, not her current gender marker, which is on her other documents.)

louie is now rethinking his international travel destinations and is concerned about how even interactions in the u.s. with law enforcement, for example, could become a problem when his passport lists one gender and his other legal documents another.

trump's passport policy already faces at least one federal lawsuit by the american civil liberties union. it argues that the executive order and passport policy are unlawful, unconstitutional and ""unmoored from scientific and medical reality.""

the american medical association supports policies ""that allow for a sex designation or change of designation on all government ids to reflect an individual's gender identity, as reported by the individual."" designating sex as either male or female only fails to factor in ""the medical spectrum of gender identity,"" risks stifling an individuals' self-expression and contributes to marginalization, the organization says. what were the old passport policies?
the ability for people to change the sex field on their passports from male to female or vice versa has been allowed since 2010, including through the first trump administration. to qualify for that change, a doctor had to certify that the applicant was being treated for gender transition. in 2021, the state department allowed people to make those changes without doctor certification and permitted applicants to select a third gender option, x, on their passport — after years of litigation. thousands of gender x passports are believed to be in circulation now, but the state department has not given a specific number.

many countries such as canada, australia, india and new zealand allow the ""x"" designation on their passports. dozens of states already allow residents to update their driver's licenses to reflect their gender identity, with ""x"" being a gender marker option in 22 states and the district of columbia. at least 16 states and d.c. allow an x gender marker option for updated birth certificates.

with the new passport policy in place, legal and advocacy groups say they are hearing from people like louie who have received passports with the wrong gender markers and some whose passports and other legal documents are being held by the state department.

passports withheld, questions unanswered
all of these issues have left people like westley ebling with passport applications in a state of limbo, with no word from the state department, and important documents, like old passports and birth certificates, withheld.

ebling, a 26-year-old in washington, d.c., submitted his passport renewal application with a gender marker change from female to male on jan. 15. the application was received on jan. 22, shortly after trump issued his executive order.

ebling wondered what this would mean for him, and when he contacted the office of his congressional representative, democratic rep. eleanor holmes norton, he was told passport applications with gender changes were being suspended indefinitely.

""that's all the information i have,"" ebling says. so for now, he doesn't have a new passport and his old one hasn't been returned. he and his partner have put travel plans on hold, he says.

intersex americans face particular challenges
the policy changes are having a profound impact on intersex people — those born with genitalia, chromosomes or reproductive organs that don't fit typical definitions for males or females — says erika lorshbough, the executive director of interact, a nonprofit that advocates for the legal and civil rights of people with intersex traits.

under trump's jan. 20 executive order — titled ""defending women from gender ideology extremism and restoring biological truth to the federal government"" — the federal government now views ""female"" as meaning ""a person belonging, at conception, to the sex that produces the large reproductive cell"" and male as ""a person belonging, at conception, to the sex that produces the small reproductive cell.""

intersex people, by definition, cannot fall into these categories, lorshbough says.

""for folks in the intersex community, visibility has always been an issue. every time you're trying to define sex in these perfectly binary terms, you're going to impact intersex people who, by definition, don't present with perfectly binary sex,"" lorshbough says.

some intersex people are assigned a sex at birth that doesn't match their development later in life, lorshbough says. the addition of the x gender marker as an option on official documents helped intersex people feel better represented, she says.

so, what happens to intersex people looking to get or update a passport now?

it's unclear for jennifer sensiba, who lives in new mexico. sensiba, 40, is intersex and was assigned male at birth.

""it became obvious when i was a teenager and young adult that i wasn't actually male. this was fine by me, because i never felt right in a male gender role,"" sensiba wrote in an email to npr. ""i was often mistaken for a transgender man, and was sometimes accused of being a woman pretending to be a man in those days.""

sensiba eventually changed how she identifies, changed her name legally and updated her gender marker on her driver's license and other ids. but her birth certificate is still unchanged, so she has ""mixed paperwork,"" as she calls it. as a young adult, sensiba had a passport under her old name, but it has long since expired. she'd have to apply all over again for a new passport.

""from what i've been reading, if there's any discrepancy in paperwork, they go with the birth certificate,"" she said.

she's tried to get answers from her local congressman, but has heard nothing. the fact that these policy decisions have pulled her and other intersex people in a black hole, shows the federal government is ""trying to regulate an issue that they know nothing about,"" she says. despite the chaos, uncertainty and fear people are feeling in the face of these changes, many say they will continue to live their lives as they have for years.

""these laws, executive orders, attempts to legislate trans people out of existence won't work,"" louie, from new york, says. ""we've won our rights over decades and we've existed before we were legally recognized by the state and we will continue to do so regardless of that.""","['louie', 'figure', 'take', 'gamble',

in a wednesday memo, office of personnel management acting director charles ezell instructed agencies to comply by friday at 5 p.m. et with an executive order that says its aim is ""defending women from gender ideology extremism.""

that memo laid out ""steps to end federal funding of gender ideology."" among those was the instruction to ""take down all outward facing media (websites, social media accounts, etc.) that inculcate or promote gender ideology."" while ""gender ideology"" is not sharply defined, trump and other transgender rights opponents have used the phrase to argue against the idea that people can identify with a gender that does not match the sex they were assigned at birth.

indeed, the executive order calls it a ""false claim that males can identify as and thus become women and vice versa."" for a time on friday evening, the entire census.gov website returned an error message. attempting to reach the census bureau's 2020 results page showed part of the site was down for maintenance. its page on sexual orientation and gender identity was still down early saturday afternoon.

the examples proliferated on social media, with academics, journalists and activists noting that basic information had disappeared from government websites. the cdc's hiv surveillance data disappeared, as noted by aaron richterman, a scientist at the university of pennsylvania. similarly, the cdc's youth risk survey data is no longer accessible, which kff's cynthia cox pointed out.

""opm sent guidance to agencies to remove gender ideology-related content from their websites by 5 pm today as part of the efforts to defend women and uphold the truth of biological sex against the radical claims of gender activists,"" opm communications director mclaurine pinover said in a statement friday evening. ""this may have been misinterpreted to mean we would shut down government websites who weren't able to comply but that is not the plan for continuing to implement this important effort."" many who support transgender rights oppose using the phrase ""gender ideology,"" as it implies that being transgender is a belief system, as opposed to an identity. nearly 2 million americans identify as trans or transgender, according to 2023 polling from kff and washington post.

this week's ""gender ideology"" memo wasn't the only order from the trump administration to remove information from websites. in another memo implementing an executive order aimed at ""ending radical and wasteful government dei programs,"" ezell instructed agencies to ""take down all outward facing media (websites, social media accounts, etc.) of deia offices."" deia stands for ""diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility"" in this order. when asked friday about the removal of ""dei"" information from websites, trump said, ""it doesn't sound like a bad idea to me. dei would have ruined our country, and now it's dead.""

the ""defending women"" executive order, and ezell's resulting memo, go well beyond policing information on government websites. ezell also instructed agencies to ""review all agency programs, contracts, and grants, and terminate any that promote or inculcate gender ideology,"" and also to make sure that forms ask for respondents' ""sex"" and not their ""gender.""

the memo additionally calls on agencies to make sure that ""intimate spaces"" are ""designated by biological sex and not gender identity,"" which could mean transgender and nonbinary employees will be restricted in which bathrooms they use. npr reached out for clarity on which spaces would be considered ""intimate spaces"" and did not receive a response.","['week', 'trump', 'administration', 'instruct', 'federal', 'agency', 'remove', 'information', 'website', 'pertain', 'gender', 'ideology', 'friday', 'flurry', 'report', 'indicate', 'exact', 'thing', 'happen', 'wednesday', 'memo', 'office', 'personnel', 'management', 'acting', 'director', 'charle', 'ezell', 'instruct', 'agency', 'comply', 'friday', 'et', 'executive', 'order', 'say', 'aim', 'defend', 'woman', 'gender', 'ideology', 'extremism', 'memo', 'lay', 'step', 'end', 'federal', 'funding', 'gender', 'ideology', 'instruction', 'outward', 'face', 'medium', 'website', 'social', 'media', 'account', 'etc', 'inculcate', 'promote', 'gender', 'ideology', 'gender', 'ideology', 'sharply', 'define', 'trump', 'transgender', 'right', 'opponent', 'phrase', 'argue', 'idea', 'people', 'identify', 'gender', 'match', 'sex', 'assign', 'birth', 'executive', 'order', 'call', 'false', 'claim', 'male', 'identify', 'woman', 'vice', 'versa', 'time', 'friday', 'evening', 'entire', 'website', 'return', 'error', 'message', 'attempt', 'reach', 'census', 'bureau', 'result', 'page', 'show', 'site', 'maintenance', 'page', 'sexual', 'orientation', 'gender', 'identity', 'early', 'saturday', 'afternoon', 'example', 'proliferate', 'social', 'medium', 'academic', 'journalist', 'activist', 'note', 'basic', 'information', 'disappear', 'government', 'website', 'cdc', 'hiv', 'surveillance', 'datum', 'disappear', 'note', 'aaron', 'richterman', 'scientist', 'university', 'pennsylvania', 'similarly', 'cdc', 'youth', 'risk', 'survey', 'data', 'long', 'accessible', 'kff', 'cynthia', 'cox', 'point', 'opm', 'send', 'guidance', 'agency', 'remove', 'gender', 'ideology', 'relate', 'content', 'website', 'pm', 'today', 'effort', 'defend', 'woman', 'uphold', 'truth', 'biological', 'sex', 'radical', 'claim', 'gender', 'activist', 'opm', 'communication', 'director', 'mclaurine', 'pinover', 'say', 'statement', 'friday', 'evening', 'misinterpret', 'mean', 'shut', 'government', 'website', 'able', 'comply', 'plan', 'continue', 'implement', 'important', 'effort', 'support', 'transgender', 'right', 'oppose', 'phrase', 'gender', 'ideology', 'imply', 'transgender', 'belief', 'system', 'oppose', 'identity', 'nearly', 'million', 'americans', 'identify', 'tran', 'transgender', 'accord', 'polling', 'kff', 'washington', 'post', 'week', 'gender', 'ideology', 'memo', 'order', 'trump', 'administration', 'remove', 'information', 'website', 'memo', 'implement', 'executive', 'order', 'aim', 'end', 'radical', 'wasteful', 'government', 'dei', 'program', 'ezell', 'instruct', 'agency', 'outward', 'face', 'medium', 'website', 'social', 'media', 'account', 'etc', 'deia', 'office', 'deia', 'stand', 'diversity', 'equity', 'inclusion', 'accessibility', 'order', 'ask', 'friday', 'removal', 'dei', 'information', 'website', 'trump', 'say', 'sound', 'like', 'bad', 'idea', 'dei', 'ruin', 'country', 'dead', 'defend', 'woman', 'executive', 'order', 'ezell', 'result', 'memo', 'police', 'information', 'government', 'website', 'ezell', 'instruct', 'agency', 'review', 'agency', 'program', 'contract', 'grant', 'terminate', 'promote', 'inculcate', 'gender', 'ideology', 'sure', 'form', 'ask', 'respondent', 'sex', 'gender', 'memo', 'additionally', 'call', 'agency', 'sure', 'intimate', 'space', 'designate', 'biological', 'sex', 'gender', 'identity', 'mean', 'transgender', 'nonbinary', 'employee', 'restrict', 'bathroom', 'use', 'npr', 'reach', 'clarity', 'space', 'consider', 'intimate', 'space', 'receive', 'response']",

the u.s. military has long said its fighting force should look like america, with all races and ethnicities included in the ranks at all levels. military officials have long tried to make its officer corps more diverse. defense secretary pete hegseth — as a commentator and writer — criticized joint chiefs chairman cq brown, who is black, for pursuing dei policies, saying he should be fired. but this week when asked if brown would remain, hegseth said they would work together. so a question for secretary hegseth is: who do you believe got a senior job because of diversity and would you fire them?

prioritizing military excellence and readiness: this order contends that service members with gender dysphoria and those with ""shifting pronoun usage or use of pronouns that inaccurately reflect an individual's sex"" are unfit to serve in the military. advocates say there are about 15,000 transgender troops among the 2.3 million service members. fewer than 2,000 have been diagnosed with gender dysphoria or had surgeries. nonetheless, the executive order speaks of transgender identity in sweeping and dismissive terms, and sets the stage for a policy that is more restrictive and punitive than the ban from trump's first term.","['abolishment', 'dei', 'diversity', 'equity', 'inclusion', 'program', 'department', 'defense', 'trump', 'official', 'continue', 'use', 'buzzword', 'like', 'wake', 'describe', 'military', 'military', 'official', 'wrong', 'exaggeration', 'december', 'army', 'secretary', 'christine', 'wormuth', 'tell', 'npr', 'spend', 'hour', 'basic', 'training', 'equal', 'opportunity', 'training', 'spend', 'like', 'hour', 'rifle', 'marksmanship', 'focus', 'lethal', 'ready', 'win', 'war', 'think', 'come', 'unit', 'soldier', 'focus', 'military', 'long', 'say', 'fighting', 'force', 'look', 'like', 'america', 'race', 'ethnicity', 'include', 'rank', 'level', 'military', 'official', 'long', 'try', 'officer', 'corp', 'diverse', 'defense', 'secretary', 'pete', 'hegseth', 'commentator', 'writer', 'criticize', 'joint', 'chiefs', 'chairman', 'cq', 'brown', 'black', 'pursue', 'dei', 'policy', 'say', 'fire', 'week', 'ask', 'brown', 'remain', 'hegseth', 'say', 'work', 'question', 'secretary', 'hegseth', 'believe', 'get', 'senior', 'job', 'diversity', 'fire', 'prioritize', 'military', 'excellence', 'readiness', 'order', 'contend', 'service', 'member', 'gender', 'dysphoria', 'shift', 'pronoun', 'usage', 'use', 'pronoun', 'inaccurately', 'reflect', 'individual', 'sex', 'unfit', 'serve', 'military', 'advocate', 'transgender', 'troop', 'million', 'service', 'member', 'few', 'diagnose', 'gender', 'dysphoria', 'surgery', 'nonetheless', 'executive', 'order', 'speak', 'transgender', 'identity', 'sweeping', 'dismissive', 'term', 'set', 'stage', 'policy', 'restrictive', 'punitive', 'ban', 'trump', 'term']",
fd46e0a7-7859-4fb8-bb69-7fe00ed65181,pro,montana lawmakers cross the aisle to block a trans bathroom ban in the state capitol,"['montana', 'lawmaker', 'cross', 'aisle', 'block', 'trans', 'bathroom', 'ban', 'state', 'capitol']",npr,rachel treisman,https://www.npr.org/2024/12/04/nx-s1-5215668/montana-transgender-bathroom-ban-zooey-zephyr,12/4/2024,"lawmakers in montana crossed party lines this week to reject a measure that would have banned a transgender representative from using the women's bathroom at the state capitol.

several republicans joined all democrats in voting against the proposal at a meeting of the joint house and senate rules committees on tuesday.

the proposed rule would have designated two bathrooms — located between the house and senate chambers — as male and female and required legislators to use the one that aligned with their sex chromosomes at birth.

""it says what probably shouldn't need to be said and puts in the rules what probably shouldn't need to be put in the rules … that the gals' restroom will be used only by gals and the guys' restroom will be used only by [guys],"" republican rep. jerry schillinger, who proposed the measure, said at tuesday's meeting.

the lawmakers did not name names but implied that the rule was aimed at democratic rep. zooey zephyr, who was elected the state's first transgender legislator in 2022 and won a second term last month.

this wouldn't be montana republicans' first time singling out zephyr: they voted in april 2023 to sanction and silence her from floor debates for breaking decorum, after she said lawmakers who supported a ban on gender-affirming healthcare for minors would have ""blood on your hands."" (while her banishment ended with the 2023 session, she has yet to return since the legislature did not meet in 2024.) ""understand that we have one representative right now but in the future, we could have many,"" republican rep. jedediah hinkle, a supporter of the measure, said on tuesday. ""this could be an ongoing thing.""

during the nearly 15-minute discussion — in which no women participated — lawmakers in favor of the rule said it would safeguard women's spaces, while those opposed questioned its utility and how it would be enforced.

critics also maintained that the accommodations made during the legislature's last session — adding locks to the nearby bathrooms' outer doors — had already addressed members' concerns. and two republican members worried that the measure itself would be a distraction. ""this particular action will have the effect of making people famous in the national news and will not contribute to the effective conduct of our business,"" said republican rep. david bedey, who opposed the bill ""reluctantly"" despite his personal views on the topic.

the proposal, which needed support from a majority of both committees, passed in the senate committee but ultimately failed in the house committee by a vote of 10-12. zephyr celebrated the outcome on social media.

""i'm happy to see that this proposed ban failed and am grateful for my colleagues — particularly my republican colleagues — who recognized this as a distraction from the work we were elected to do,"" she posted on x. ""i'm ready to represent my constituents & look forward to working on behalf of montana."" a similar conversation has been playing out in congress
on tuesday, hinkle — one of the montana rule's republican supporters — acknowledged that the issue has been in the national spotlight.

""i think it's time that this body addresses this issue now as they are addressing it nationally,"" he said.

the montana measure came right after a similar conversation arose in the nation's capital — but ended in a very different outcome. in early november, democratic rep.-elect sarah mcbride of delaware became the first openly transgender person elected to congress.

weeks later, republican rep. nancy mace of south carolina introduced a measure that would ban transgender women from using facilities in the capitol building that do not correspond with their sex at birth. mace later followed up with legislation that would extend to all facilities on federal property.

house speaker mike johnson hasn't commented on a plan to vote on those measures, but released a clarification saying all single-sex facilities in the capitol and house office buildings are ""reserved for individuals of that biological sex.""

mcbride — like many of her soon-to-be democratic colleagues — criticized the ordeal as a distraction, but said she will comply with the rules johnson outlined.

""i'm not here to fight about bathrooms,"" tweeted mcbride, who will take office in january. ""i'm here to fight for delawareans and to bring down costs facing families.""","['lawmaker', 'montana', 'cross', 'party', 'line', 'week', 'reject', 'measure', 'ban', 'transgend', 'representative', 'woman', 'bathroom', 'state', 'capitol', 'republicans', 'join', 'democrats', 'vote', 'proposal', 'meeting', 'joint', 'house', 'senate', 'rule', 'committee', 'tuesday', 'propose', 'rule', 'designate', 'bathroom', 'locate', 'house', 'senate', 'chamber', 'male', 'female', 'require', 'legislator', 'use', 'align', 'sex', 'chromosome', 'birth', 'say', 'probably', 'need', 'say', 'put', 'rule', 'probably', 'need', 'rule', 'gal', 'restroom', 'gal', 'guy', 'restroom', 'guy', 'republican', 'rep', 'jerry', 'schillinger', 'propose', 'measure', 'say', 'tuesday', 'meeting', 'lawmaker', 'name', 'imply', 'rule', 'aim', 'democratic', 'rep', 'zooey', 'zephyr', 'elect', 'state', 'transgender', 'legislator', 'win', 'second', 'term', 'month', 'montana', 'republicans', 'time', 'single', 'zephyr', 'vote', 'april', 'sanction', 'silence', 'floor', 'debate', 'break', 'decorum', 'say', 'lawmaker', 'support', 'ban', 'gender', 'affirm', 'healthcare', 'minor', 'blood', 'hand', 'banishment', 'end', 'session', 'return', 'legislature', 'meet', 'understand', 'representative', 'right', 'future', 'republican', 'rep', 'jedediah', 'hinkle', 'supporter', 'measure', 'say', 'tuesday', 'ongoing', 'thing', 'nearly', 'minute', 'discussion', 'woman', 'participate', 'lawmaker', 'favor', 'rule', 'say', 'safeguard', 'woman', 'space', 'oppose', 'question', 'utility', 'enforce', 'critic', 'maintain', 'accommodation', 'legislature', 'session', 'add', 'lock', 'nearby', 'bathroom', 'outer', 'door', 'address', 'member', 'concern', 'republican', 'member', 'worry', 'measure', 'distraction', 'particular', 'action', 'effect', 'make', 'people', 'famous', 'national', 'news', 'contribute', 'effective', 'conduct', 'business', 'say', 'republican', 'rep', 'david', 'bedey', 'oppose', 'bill', 'reluctantly', 'despite', 'personal', 'view', 'topic', 'proposal', 'need', 'support', 'majority', 'committee', 'pass', 'senate', 'committee', 'ultimately', 'fail', 'house', 'committee', 'vote', 'zephyr', 'celebrate', 'outcome', 'social', 'medium', 'happy', 'propose', 'ban', 'fail', 'grateful', 'colleague', 'particularly', 'republican', 'colleague', 'recognize', 'distraction', 'work', 'elect', 'post', 'ready', 'represent', 'constituent', 'look', 'forward', 'work', 'behalf', 'montana', 'similar', 'conversation', 'play', 'congress', 'tuesday', 'hinkle', 'montana', 'rule', 'republican', 'supporter', 'acknowledge', 'issue', 'national', 'spotlight', 'think', 'time', 'body', 'address', 'issue', 'address', 'nationally', 'say', 'montana', 'measure', 'come', 'right', 'similar', 'conversation', 'arise', 'nation', 'capital', 'end', 'different', 'outcome', 'early', 'november', 'democratic', 'sarah', 'mcbride', 'delaware', 'openly', 'transgender', 'person', 'elect', 'congress', 'week', 'later', 'republican', 'rep', 'nancy', 'mace', 'south', 'carolina', 'introduce', 'measure', 'ban', 'transgender', 'woman', 'facility', 'capitol', 'building', 'correspond', 'sex', 'birth', 'mace', 'later', 'follow', 'legislation', 'extend', 'facility', 'federal', 'property', 'house', 'speaker', 'mike', 'johnson', 'comment', 'plan', 'vote', 'measure', 'release', 'clarification', 'say', 'single', 'sex', 'facility', 'capitol', 'house', 'office', 'building', 'reserve', 'individual', 'biological', 'sex', 'mcbride', 'like', 'soon', 'democratic', 'colleague', 'criticize', 'ordeal', 'distraction', 'say', 'comply', 'rule', 'johnson', 'outline', 'fight', 'bathroom', 'tweet', 'mcbride', 'office', 'january', 'fight', 'delawarean', 'bring', 'cost', 'face', 'family']",
2d3c674f-a93b-4bf2-bf61-1270e6e970ce,pro,"trump's executive orders promoting sex discrimination, explained","['trump', 'executive', 'order', 'promote', 'sex', 'discrimination', 'explain']",aclu,gillian branstetter,https://www.aclu.org/news/lgbtq-rights/trumps-executive-orders-promoting-sex-discrimination-explained,1/22/2025,"donald trump was re-elected president on a wave of attacks against women and transgender people. anti-transgender politicians spent more than $215 million on ads scapegoating trans people and promoting a project 2025 agenda that threatens to rollback reproductive freedom and punish people for departing from archaic gender roles. on his first day back in office, president trump signed a far-reaching executive order requiring federal agencies to discriminate against transgender people by denying who they are and threatening the freedom of self-determination and self-expression for all.

in 2020, the supreme court issued a 6-3 ruling in bostock v. clayton county affirming that discrimination against someone because they are lgbtq is sex discrimination under title vii of the 1964 civil rights act. justice neil gorsuch, writing for the majority, said: “it is impossible to discriminate against a person for being homosexual or transgender without discriminating against that individual based on sex.” trump also withdrew an executive order issued by former president joe biden directing federal agencies to enforce this court ruling as applied to all laws prohibiting sex discrimination.

we all deserve the freedom to be ourselves, including the right to determine what’s right for our bodies and lives. trump’s sex discrimination mandate threatens to deny that freedom to transgender people across the country while forcing everyone else to sacrifice their own freedom and privacy, too.

what does the order say?
trump’s signed order states: “it is the policy of the united states to recognize two sexes, male and female.  these sexes are not changeable and are grounded in fundamental and incontrovertible reality.” the order defines terms like “man” and “woman” based on whether a person “at conception” belongs “to the sex that produces the large reproductive cell” or that “produces the small reproductive cell.”

trump’s order then directs federal agencies to “enforce laws governing sex-based rights, protections, opportunities, and accommodations” using his cramped definitions, including designating sex on passports and other federal identification documents, or determining where transgender people are confined in federal custody. the order also includes a sweeping mandate to all agencies to “end the federal funding of gender ideology.” of course, the order does not explain what that means or how agencies would accomplish such a task.

for decades, feminist legal scholars and women’s rights advocates have opposed efforts to define gender based strictly on biology. recent state laws that use these definitions to discriminate against transgender people have resulted in invasive and traumatizing efforts to determine who “counts” as a man or as a woman, targeting youth who are even suspected of being transgender because they do not conform to sex stereotypes. this order likewise ignores the existence of intersex people and others with variations in sex characteristics beyond the overly-simplistic definitions trump endorsed.

what does the order do?
very few executive orders change policy immediately, and they cannot change laws passed by congress or protections guaranteed by the constitution. as of january 21, 2025 it is unclear how the trump administration will enforce this order as applied to educational settings, health care access, housing, federally-funded programs, and many other areas where federal law or policy references “sex” or “gender.”

some of the most immediate impacts will likely be felt by the more than 2,000 transgender people currently held in federal custody. the order specifically calls on the federal bureau of prisons (bop) and the department of homeland security (dhs) to ignore the guidelines of the prison rape elimination act (prea) and enforce a blanket policy forcing transgender women into men’s prisons and detention centers against their will. this puts them at a severely heightened risk of sexual assault and abuse by other incarcerated persons and prison staff. the order also mandates that bop withdraw critical health care from trans people in federal prison.

we also expect to see immediate impacts on access to updated sex designations on u.s. passports. transgender people frequently update the sex designation on documents like birth certificates, driver’s licenses, and passports to reflect their gender identity rather than the sex they were assigned at birth. requiring transgender peoples’ passports to show the sex they were assigned at birth effectively outs them as transgender whenever they have to present the document.

soon after the order was issued, a trump administration official told a reporter that the policy impacting gender markers on u.s. passports would not apply retroactively for current passport holders. trump’s order will, however, prevent transgender and intersex people from obtaining new passports, visas, and trusted traveler documents that reflect who they are and how they are perceived in the world.

the state department recently said that all applications for gender change are ""suspended."" because people have to provide their existing passport and other documents to update their passport, if people attempt to update the sex designation on their passport now, they run the risk of not having a valid passport at all while the passport is out of their possession.

what happens next?
we expect the order may be enforced in other contexts, such as in public schools and sex-separated spaces. it may also be used to limit workplace protections and to limit federally-funded programs that provide access for gender-affirming health care. if federal agencies and departments act to make those risks a reality, the aclu and other lgbtq rights organizations will fight them every step of the way.

these harmful anti-lgbtq provisions come at a time when legislative attacks against the lgbtq community are at an all-time high. as of this month, 506 anti-lgbtq bills have been introduced in state legislatures this year alone. bills such as the protection of women and girls in sports act, which would prohibit transgender students from participating in sports teams that align with their gender identity, have been introduced in the house of representatives at alarming rates. in fact, the house has already passed other pieces of legislation that are considered to be must-pass bills, such as the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2024, with provisions that ban gender-affirming care, drag performances, and pride flag displays. out of all the appropriations bills, however, the labor, health, and human services, education, and related agencies appropriations bill for fy 2024 is arguably the most nefarious and dangerous for the transgender community. the anti-lgbtq riders in this bill seek to prohibit funds from being used for implementing anti-discrimination and equity programs, taking discriminatory action against anyone that speaks or acts in accordance with the belief that marriage is between a man and a woman, or displaying pride flags. section 534 of this bill would also prohibit funds from being used for gender-affirming surgical procedures or hormone therapies. if passed, this will have extensive, damaging effects.

the centers for medicare and medicaid services (cms) is an agency within the u.s. department of health and human services, one of the departments funded by the labor-hhs appropriations bill. cms provides health coverage through medicaid to about 84.5 million enrollees as of july 2023, including eligible low-income adults. currently, medicaid is one the largest payers for health care in the united states. as of december 2022, about 276,000 transgender people in the united states are enrolled in medicaid and about 60 percent of these beneficiaries reside in states or territories where medicaid programs specifically include coverage for gender-affirming care, including hormone therapy, surgical procedures, and other gender-affirming treatments. another 27 percent of transgender medicaid beneficiaries live in states where laws are silent or unclear on coverage for gender-affirming care. in 14 states, laws do not include express statutes or policies addressing gender-affirming care under medicaid. in four additional states, policies explicitly exclude this care under state medicaid programs, but actions by state legislatures, officials, and courts have indicated that these states have inconsistently enforced or may not be enforcing these policies. unfortunately, about 14 percent of transgender medicaid beneficiaries reside in states that expressly ban access to gender-affirming care covered by medicaid.

this 14 percent will grow drastically with the passage of the labor-hhs appropriations bill. without funding for the u.s. department of health and human services, medicaid programs will be unable to cover gender-affirming surgical programs or hormone therapies for thousands of transgender people, many of whom are low-income.

not only will too many lack the sufficient funds to turn to private medical programs or services, but states are also increasingly introducing and passing restrictions on gender-affirming care across the country. there are currently 135 state bills targeting health care for transgender people, many of which seek to ban gender-affirming care, establish criminal penalties for providing such care, or block funding to medical centers that offer this life-saving care.","['fiscal', 'year', 'appropriation', 'process', 'litter', 'anti', 'lgbtq', 'attack', 'republican', 'member', 'house', 'representative', 'insert', 'anti', 'lgbtq', 'provision', 'pass', 'appropriation', 'bill', 'rider', 'include', 'restriction', 'gender', 'affirm', 'care', 'allowance', 'discrimination', 'sex', 'couple', 'prohibition', 'drag', 'performance', 'ban', 'pride', 'flag', 'display', 'restriction', 'diversity', 'inclusion', 'program', 'harmful', 'anti', 'lgbtq', 'provision', 'come', 'time', 'legislative', 'attack', 'lgbtq', 'community', 'time', 'high', 'month', 'anti', 'lgbtq', 'bill', 'introduce', 'state', 'legislature', 'year', 'bill', 'protection', 'woman', 'girl', 'sport', 'act', 'prohibit', 'transgender', 'student', 'participate', 'sport', 'team', 'align', 'gender', 'identity', 'introduce', 'house', 'representative', 'alarming', 'rate', 'fact', 'house', 'pass', 'piece', 'legislation', 'consider', 'pass', 'bill', 'national', 'defense', 'authorization', 'act', 'fiscal', 'year', 'provision', 'ban', 'gender', 'affirm', 'care', 'drag', 'performance', 'pride', 'flag', 'display', 'appropriation', 'bill', 'labor', 'health', 'human', 'service', 'education', 'related', 'agency', 'appropriation', 'bill', 'fy', 'arguably', 'nefarious', 'dangerous', 'transgender', 'community', 'anti', 'lgbtq', 'rider', 'bill', 'seek', 'prohibit', 'fund', 'implement', 'anti', 'discrimination', 'equity', 'program', 'take', 'discriminatory', 'action', 'speak', 'act', 'accordance', 'belief', 'marriage', 'man', 'woman', 'display', 'pride', 'flag', 'section', 'bill', 'prohibit', 'fund', 'gender', 'affirm', 'surgical', 'procedure', 'hormone', 'therapy', 'pass', 'extensive', 'damaging', 'effect', 'center', 'medicare', 'medicaid', 'service', 'cms', 'agency', 'department', 'health', 'human', 'service', 'department', 'fund', 'labor', 'hhs', 'appropriation', 'bill', 'cms', 'provide', 'health', 'coverage', 'medicaid', 'million', 'enrollee', 'july', 'include', 'eligible', 'low', 'income', 'adult', 'currently', 'medicaid', 'large', 'payer', 'health', 'care', 'united', 'states', 'december', 'transgender', 'people', 'united', 'states', 'enrol', 'medicaid', 'percent', 'beneficiary', 'reside', 'state', 'territory', 'medicaid', 'program', 'specifically', 'include', 'coverage', 'gender', 'affirm', 'care', 'include', 'hormone', 'therapy', 'surgical', 'procedure', 'gender', 'affirm', 'treatment', 'percent', 'transgender', 'medicaid', 'beneficiary', 'live', 'state', 'law', 'silent', 'unclear', 'coverage', 'gender', 'affirm', 'care', 'state', 'law', 'include', 'express', 'statute', 'policy', 'address', 'gender', 'affirm', 'care', 'medicaid', 'additional', 'state', 'policy', 'explicitly', 'exclude', 'care', 'state', 'medicaid', 'program', 'action', 'state', 'legislature', 'official', 'court', 'indicate', 'state', 'inconsistently', 'enforce', 'enforce', 'policy', 'unfortunately', 'percent', 'transgender', 'medicaid', 'beneficiary', 'reside', 'state', 'expressly', 'ban', 'access', 'gender', 'affirm', 'care', 'cover', 'medicaid', 'percent', 'grow', 'drastically', 'passage', 'labor', 'hhs', 'appropriation', 'bill', 'fund', 'department', 'health', 'human', 'service', 'medicaid', 'program', 'unable', 'cover', 'gender', 'affirm', 'surgical', 'program', 'hormone', 'therapy', 'thousand', 'transgender', 'people', 'low', 'income', 'lack', 'sufficient', 'fund', 'turn', 'private', 'medical', 'program', 'service', 'state', 'increasingly', 'introduce', 'pass', 'restriction', 'gender', 'affirm', 'care', 'country', 'currently', 'state', 'bill', 'target', 'health', 'care', 'transgender', 'people', 'seek', 'ban', 'gender', 'affirm', 'care', 'establish', 'criminal', 'penalty', 'provide', 'care', 'block', 'funding', 'medical', 'center', 'offer', 'life', 'save', 'care']",
fb0e073d-7a99-4d34-a154-f1fbd7ff187d,pro,free speech coalition urges supreme court to strike down texas’ unconstitutional age verification law,"['free', 'speech', 'coalition', 'urge', 'supreme', 'court', 'strike', 'texas', 'unconstitutional', 'age', 'verification', 'law']",aclu,none listed,https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/free-speech-coalition-urges-supreme-court-to-strike-down-texas-unconstitutional-age-verification-law,9/16/2024,"the american civil liberties union, aclu of texas, and quinn emanuel today filed a brief in the supreme court on behalf of the free speech coalition (fsc) and other plaintiffs in free speech coalition v. paxton, arguing that the age verification provision in texas’s h.b 1181 violates the first amendment by improperly burdening adults’ right to access sexual content online.

h.b. 1181 requires any website that publishes content one-third or more of which is “harmful to minors” — a broad category that includes virtually any explicit content — to force their visitors to provide digital ids or other proof of age before they can access the published material, regardless of what is on the other two-thirds of the site.

“adults in america have a first amendment right to read about sexual health, see r-rated movies, watch porn, and otherwise access information about sex if they want to. they should be allowed to exercise that right as they see fit, without having to worry about exposing their personal identifying information in the process,” said vera eidelman, staff attorney with the aclu speech, privacy and technology project. “rather than requiring adults to give up their privacy in order to watch and read content the government doesn’t like, legislators should focus on shaping a safer internet through things like voluntary content filters, which give control to people, not the government.”

texas claims this provision is about protecting minors from accessing sexual content deemed harmful to them, not regulating disfavored content, but it does not merely restrict minors’ access. it also restricts adults’ access, requiring them to identify themselves online and burdening their ability to exercise their first amendment rights to see sexual content or any other material on a regulated site. as the brief explains, requiring individuals to verify their ages before accessing this protected speech robs people of anonymity, and threatens to bar individuals—for example, those who lack government identification or whose age is misidentified by the relevant technology—from accessing certain websites altogether. such a restriction is not necessary given the availability of other options, like content filtering, that could accomplish the government’s goal while imposing less of a burden on speech.

“while texas’ law may sound reasonable on its face, in practice, it is extraordinarily burdensome and invasive, effectively deterring adults from accessing legal content,” said alison boden, executive director of the free speech coalition. “to make matters worse, this law – and ones like it – fail at their stated goal of protecting children online, despite forcing adult content creators and consumers to operate under the threat of surveillance and censorship.”

at the same time, the law will not accomplish its stated goal. because the law only applies if one-third of a site’s content is explicit, social media sites that offer much of the same content, but as a smaller proportion of their total offerings, avoid the law’s requirement. and search engines are exempted entirely, meaning minors can access exactly the same sexual content online via such sites. moreover, the law’s requirement that regulated sites issue unscientific health warnings about the negative effects of exposure to pornography illustrate the state’s distaste for the regulated speakers.

before the case reached the supreme court, a district court briefly blocked the law from being enforced, concluding that the law’s age verification provision would unconstitutionally chill the speech of adults. however, a divided fifth circuit panel vacated that injunction, reasoning that the age verification provisions’ burden on adults’ first amendment rights merely has to have some rational basis–not face strict scrutiny–because the aim is to protect children. unless the supreme court issues a reversal, this decision will overturn decades of precedent protecting the free speech rights of adults.

in prior cases brought by the aclu, the supreme court has repeatedly held that requiring users to verify their age to access protected content is unconstitutional where there are less restrictive alternatives available, like filtering software. in reno v. aclu, the supreme court unanimously ruled that anti-indecency provisions of the 1996 communications decency act, also meant to protect children, violated the first amendment's guarantee of freedom of speech in part because of the burden it imposed on adults. in ashcroft v. aclu, the court held that a law almost identical to the texas law had to satisfy strict scrutiny because it restricted adults’ access to protected sexual speech. where a less-restrictive alternative exists—for example, the voluntary installation of filtering software on minors’ devices—the government cannot impose age verification on adults in the name of protecting children.

free speech coalition v. paxton is one of several cases in which the aclu has urged courts to reject age verification schemes that would burden the free speech rights of internet users as part of the organization’s long tradition of defending online free expression.","['american', 'civil', 'liberty', 'union', 'aclu', 'texas', 'quinn', 'emanuel', 'today', 'file', 'brief', 'supreme', 'court', 'behalf', 'free', 'speech', 'coalition', 'fsc', 'plaintiff', 'free', 'speech', 'coalition', 'paxton', 'argue', 'age', 'verification', 'provision', 'texas', 'violate', 'amendment', 'improperly', 'burden', 'adult', 'right', 'access', 'sexual', 'content', 'online', 'require', 'website', 'publish', 'content', 'harmful', 'minor', 'broad', 'category', 'include', 'virtually', 'explicit', 'content', 'force', 'visitor', 'provide', 'digital', 'id', 'proof', 'age', 'access', 'publish', 'material', 'regardless', 'third', 'site', 'adult', 'america', 'amendment', 'right', 'read', 'sexual', 'health', 'r', 'rate', 'movie', 'watch', 'porn', 'access', 'information', 'sex', 'want', 'allow', 'exercise', 'right', 'fit', 'have', 'worry', 'expose', 'personal', 'identify', 'information', 'process', 'say', 'vera', 'eidelman', 'staff', 'attorney', 'aclu', 'speech', 'privacy', 'technology', 'project', 'require', 'adult', 'privacy', 'order', 'watch', 'read', 'content', 'government', 'like', 'legislator', 'focus', 'shape', 'safe', 'internet', 'thing', 'like', 'voluntary', 'content', 'filter', 'control', 'people', 'government', 'texas', 'claim', 'provision', 'protect', 'minor', 'access', 'sexual', 'content', 'deem', 'harmful', 'regulate', 'disfavored', 'content', 'merely', 'restrict', 'minor', 'access', 'restrict', 'adult', 'access', 'require', 'identify', 'online', 'burden', 'ability', 'exercise', 'amendment', 'right', 'sexual', 'content', 'material', 'regulated', 'site', 'brief', 'explain', 'require', 'individual', 'verify', 'age', 'access', 'protect', 'speech', 'rob', 'people', 'anonymity', 'threaten', 'bar', 'individual', 'example', 'lack', 'government', 'identification', 'age', 'misidentifie', 'relevant', 'technology', 'access', 'certain', 'website', 'altogether', 'restriction', 'necessary', 'give', 'availability', 'option', 'like', 'content', 'filtering', 'accomplish', 'government', 'goal', 'impose', 'burden', 'speech', 'texas', 'law', 'sound', 'reasonable', 'face', 'practice', 'extraordinarily', 'burdensome', 'invasive', 'effectively', 'deter', 'adult', 'access', 'legal', 'content', 'say', 'alison', 'boden', 'executive', 'director', 'free', 'speech', 'coalition', 'matter', 'bad', 'law', 'one', 'like', 'fail', 'state', 'goal', 'protect', 'child', 'online', 'despite', 'force', 'adult', 'content', 'creator', 'consumer', 'operate', 'threat', 'surveillance', 'censorship', 'time', 'law', 'accomplish', 'state', 'goal', 'law', 'apply', 'site', 'content', 'explicit', 'social', 'medium', 'site', 'offer', 'content', 'small', 'proportion', 'total', 'offering', 'avoid', 'law', 'requirement', 'search', 'engine', 'exempt', 'entirely', 'mean', 'minor', 'access', 'exactly', 'sexual', 'content', 'online', 'site', 'law', 'requirement', 'regulate', 'site', 'issue', 'unscientific', 'health', 'warning', 'negative', 'effect', 'exposure', 'pornography', 'illustrate', 'state', 'distaste', 'regulated', 'speaker', 'case', 'reach', 'supreme', 'court', 'district', 'court', 'briefly', 'block', 'law', 'enforce', 'conclude', 'law', 'age', 'verification', 'provision', 'unconstitutionally', 'chill', 'speech', 'adult', 'divide', 'fifth', 'circuit', 'panel', 'vacate', 'injunction', 'reason', 'age', 'verification', 'provision', 'burden', 'adult', 'amendment', 'right', 'merely', 'rational', 'basis', 'face', 'strict', 'scrutiny', 'aim', 'protect', 'child', 'supreme', 'court', 'issue', 'reversal', 'decision', 'overturn', 'decade', 'precedent', 'protect', 'free', 'speech', 'right', 'adult', 'prior', 'case', 'bring', 'aclu', 'supreme', 'court', 'repeatedly', 'hold', 'require', 'user', 'verify', 'age', 'access', 'protect', 'content', 'unconstitutional', 'restrictive', 'alternative', 'available', 'like', 'filter', 'software', 'reno', 'aclu', 'supreme', 'court', 'unanimously', 'rule', 'anti', 'indecency', 'provision', 'communication', 'decency', 'act', 'mean', 'protect', 'child', 'violate', 'amendment', 'guarantee', 'freedom', 'speech', 'burden', 'impose', 'adult', 'ashcroft', 'aclu', 'court', 'hold', 'law', 'identical', 'texas', 'law', 'satisfy', 'strict', 'scrutiny', 'restrict', 'adult', 'access', 'protect', 'sexual', 'speech', 'restrictive', 'alternative', 'exist', 'example', 'voluntary', 'installation', 'filter', 'software', 'minor', 'device', 'government', 'impose', 'age', 'verification', 'adult', 'protect', 'child', 'free', 'speech', 'coalition', 'paxton', 'case', 'aclu', 'urge', 'court', 'reject', 'age', 'verification', 'scheme', 'burden', 'free', 'speech', 'right', 'internet', 'user', 'organization', 'long', 'tradition', 'defend', 'online', 'free', 'expression']",

in an executive order signed in january, the president used a narrow definition of the sexes instead of a broader conception of gender. the order says a person is male or female and it rejects the idea that someone can transition from the sex assigned at birth to another gender. the framing is in line with many conservatives’ views but at odds with major medical groups and policies under former president joe biden.

u.s. district judge julia kobick, who was appointed by president joe biden, sided with the american civil liberties union’s motion for a preliminary injunction, which stays the action while the lawsuit plays out.

“the executive order and the passport policy on their face classify passport applicants on the basis of sex and thus must be reviewed under intermediate judicial scrutiny,” kobick wrote. “that standard requires the government to demonstrate that its actions are substantially related to an important governmental interest. the government has failed to meet this standard.”

the aclu, which sued the trump administration on behalf of five transgender americans and two nonbinary plaintiffs, said the new policy would effectively mean transgender, nonbinary and intersex americans could not get an accurate passport.

“we all have a right to accurate identity documents, and this policy invites harassment, discrimination, and violence against transgender americans who can no longer obtain or renew a passport that matches who they are,” aclu lawyer sruti swaminathan said.

in response to the lawsuit, the trump administration argued the passport policy change “does not violate the equal protection guarantees of the constitution.” they also contended that the president has broad discretion in setting passport policy and that plaintiffs would not be harmed by the policy, since they are still free to travel abroad.","['federal', 'judge', 'friday', 'block', 'trump', 'administration', 'enact', 'policy', 'ban', 'use', 'x', 'marker', 'nonbinary', 'people', 'passport', 'changing', 'gender', 'marker', 'executive', 'order', 'sign', 'january', 'president', 'narrow', 'definition', 'sex', 'instead', 'broad', 'conception', 'gender', 'order', 'say', 'person', 'male', 'female', 'reject', 'idea', 'transition', 'sex', 'assign', 'birth', 'gender', 'framing', 'line', 'conservative', 'view', 'odd', 'major', 'medical', 'group', 'policy', 'president', 'joe', 'biden', 'read', 'federal', 'judge', 'block', 'trump', 'ban', 'transgender', 'people', 'serve', 'military', 'district', 'judge', 'julia', 'kobick', 'appoint', 'president', 'joe', 'biden', 'side', 'american', 'civil', 'liberty', 'union', 'motion', 'preliminary', 'injunction', 'stay', 'action', 'lawsuit', 'play', 'executive', 'order', 'passport', 'policy', 'face', 'classify', 'passport', 'applicant', 'basis', 'sex', 'review', 'intermediate', 'judicial', 'scrutiny', 'kobick', 'write', 'standard', 'require', 'government', 'demonstrate', 'action', 'substantially', 'related', 'important', 'governmental', 'interest', 'government', 'fail', 'meet', 'standard', 'aclu', 'sue', 'trump', 'administration', 'behalf', 'transgender', 'americans', 'nonbinary', 'plaintiff', 'say', 'new', 'policy', 'effectively', 'mean', 'transgender', 'nonbinary', 'intersex', 'americans', 'accurate', 'passport', 'right', 'accurate', 'identity', 'document', 'policy', 'invite', 'harassment', 'discrimination', 'violence', 'transgender', 'americans', 'long', 'obtain', 'renew', 'passport', 'match', 'aclu', 'lawyer', 'sruti', 'swaminathan', 'say', 'response', 'lawsuit', 'trump', 'administration', 'argue', 'passport', 'policy', 'change', 'violate', 'equal', 'protection', 'guarantee', 'constitution', 'contend', 'president', 'broad', 'discretion', 'set', 'passport', 'policy', 'plaintiff', 'harm', 'policy', 'free', 'travel', 'abroad']",

watch: transgender americans share concerns about trump’s threats to rollback rights

dewine signed the law out of public view tuesday over the objections of democrats, teachers’ unions and civil rights groups, which had hoped that his objections to a ban on gender-affirming care for minors last year would carry through and prompt another veto. it takes effect in 90 days.

the governor issued no statement regarding the signing.

the republican-backed measure — labeled the “protect all students act” — requires public and private schools, colleges and universities to designate separate bathrooms, locker rooms and overnight accommodations “for the exclusive use” of either males and females, based on one’s gender assigned at or near birth, in school buildings and other facilities used for school-sponsored events. it contains no enforcement mechanism.

“it revolves around safety, security, and, i think, common sense. it protects our children and grandchildren in private spaces where they are most vulnerable,” said republican ohio state sen. jerry cirino, the bill’s sponsor.

school employees, emergency situations and people assisting young children or someone with a disability are exempted from the restrictions and schools can still offer single-use or family bathrooms.

aaron baer, president of the center for christian virtue, which backed the bill, said in a statement, “common sense is on a winning streak in america today. no student should be forced to go into the bathroom or locker room with a student of the opposite sex, and ohio’s kids are better protected now because of governor dewine’s decision to sign this bill.”

the aclu of ohio was among the groups that had lobbied for a veto, condemning the measure as a violation of the right of privacy of lgbtq+ ohioans that will make them less safe.

equality ohio, the state’s lgbtq+ advocacy and legal aid organization, said the law poses risks to transgender youth “or anyone perceived as transgender by authorities.”

“we are deeply disappointed that governor dewine has allowed this dangerous bill to become law that puts vulnerable trans youth at risk for abuse and harassment,” executive director dwayne steward said in a statement. the group said it will continue to fight “for a state that embraces and respects all its residents.”

with dewine’s signature, ohio adds to the pushback that’s cropped up nationally among many republican politicians, including president-elect donald trump, as transgender people have gained more visibility and acceptance on some fronts in recent years.

twenty-six states have now adopted laws restarting or banning gender-affirming care for transgender minors. the u.s. supreme court is scheduled to hear arguments dec. 4 on whether tennessee’s ban on such treatments can continue to be enforced; any ruling is likely to impact policies in other states, too.

at least 11 states have adopted laws, like ohio’s, barring transgender girls and women from girls and women’s bathrooms at public schools – and in some cases, in other government facilities.

and at least 24 states have laws dictating which sports competitions transgender girls and women can join.

ohio’s bathroom bill was debated for 19 months before finally clearing the gop-led legislature on nov. 13, during transgender awareness week. it was tacked onto a separate piece of legislation by the ohio house that related to the state’s college credit plus program, which allows high-schoolers to earn college credit.

trump’s campaign leaned heavily into opposing transgender rights in the last weeks of his race against vice president kamala harris, including trump’s vow at a madison square garden rally that “we will keep men out of women’s sports” and campaign ads saying, “kamala’s for they/them. president trump is for you.”

watch: why anti-transgender political ads are dominating the airwaves this election

it’s not clear what policies trump might adopt once he takes office in january. but bills relating to gender issues are already being queued up in state legislatures that come into session early in 2025.

in texas, for instance, there are proposed measures to bar using state money to pay for “gender reassignment,” to use state money to pay to reverse gender transitions, and to give people who receive gender-affirming care before they turn 15 until they turn 25 to sue their doctors for malpractice, among others. democrats in the republican-dominated legislature there have also introduced some bills intended to protect people from discrimination on the basis of “gender identity or expression.”

in ohio, a law that both bars gender-affirming care for minors and blocks transgender girls and women from participating in girls and women’s sports competitions took effect in august. it took a rocky path, though. the measure became law only after the legislature overrode dewine’s veto. and after that, a judge put enforcement on hold for about four months before allowing it.","['transgender',

d5c521c4-f607-44e5-a04d-e0a693aa4fd3,pro,over 850 anti-lgbtq+ bills filed in the u.s. so far in 2025,"['anti', 'bill', 'file', 'far']",erin in the morning,erin reed,https://www.erininthemorning.com/p/over-850-anti-lgbtq-bills-filed-in,4/19/2025,"over the past five years, republican lawmakers have turned anti-trans legislation into a full-blown political obsession. what began as a handful of bills targeting sports participation and so-called religious exemptions has metastasized into a sweeping campaign against nearly every facet of transgender life—bathroom access, ids, medical care, even the legality of one’s identity. in 2020, there were just over 100 bills aimed at lgbtq+ people. in 2025, that number has ballooned to more than 850, the vast majority singling out transgender americans. what we are witnessing now is not a legislative trend—it’s a coordinated nationwide crusade.

in 2020, most anti-trans legislation centered on banning transgender youth from sports—a proposal that, at the time, was considered extreme. the political optics of attacking lgbtq+ people so soon after the obergefell ruling were poor, and the memory of north carolina’s disastrous bathroom ban was still fresh. that law, which forced trans people to use restrooms that didn’t align with their gender identity, backfired spectacularly and was widely credited with helping sink republican prospects in the 2018 midterms in the state.

nevertheless, some republicans had identified sports as a way to get their foot in the door to further discrimination. the president of the american principles project, terry schilling, detailed how this was the case, “the women's sports issue was really the beginning point in helping expose all this because what it did was, it got opponents of the lgbt movement comfortable with talking about transgender issues.”

in the years that followed, the volume and severity of anti-trans legislation escalated dramatically. over 200 bills were proposed in 2022, and more than 500 in 2023, with each legislative session raising the ceiling on what republicans considered politically palatable. sports bans, once fringe, became boilerplate by 2021. the next year, states that had passed sports bans moved swiftly to criminalize gender-affirming care, and drag bans and bathroom restrictions emerged as the new line of attack. today, those once-extreme measures are commonplace, and republicans are setting their sights on even broader targets: bans on id changes, adult healthcare restrictions, and increasingly punitive measures that chip away at the basic legal recognition of trans lives. some bills have even been proposed to criminalize transgender identities altogether.

as of 2025, a staggering 867 bills have been introduced targeting transgender people across the united states. of these, 122 would ban gender-affirming care for some segment of the trans population. another 77 seek to bar transgender people from certain bathrooms—a threat made more tangible as arrests for alleged “wrong bathroom” usage have begun to mount. seventy-three bills aim to eliminate legal recognition of transgender people entirely, often by revoking updated driver’s licenses, stripping correct gender markers, and invalidating identification documents. others target drag (and transgender people dressed in the “wrong clothes”) or require schools to forcibly out transgender students. a newer, especially chilling category would classify gender-affirming care or even social transition as child abuse, opening the door for state-sanctioned removal of trans youth from supportive homes. so far, 51 anti-trans bills have been signed into law this year, with many more advancing through state legislatures.

as state legislatures escalate their assault on transgender rights, the federal government under trump has doubled down—punishing blue states for protective laws, banning transgender people from military service, investigating teachers for affirming trans students, defunding hospitals that provide care, and targeting organizations simply for acknowledging the word “transgender.” in scope and intensity, 2025 has become the most punishing year yet for transgender people in america. the goal is unmistakable: to make it nearly impossible for transgender people to live openly, safely, and with dignity in public life.","['past', 'year', 'republican', 'lawmaker', 'turn', 'anti', 'trans', 'legislation', 'blow', 'political', 'obsession', 'begin', 'handful', 'bill', 'target', 'sport', 'participation', 'call', 'religious', 'exemption', 'metastasize', 'sweeping', 'campaign', 'nearly', 'facet', 'transgender', 'life', 'bathroom', 'access', 'id', 'medical', 'care', 'legality', 'identity', 'bill', 'aim', 'people', 'number', 'balloon', 'vast', 'majority', 'single', 'transgend', 'americans', 'witness', 'legislative', 'trend', 'coordinated', 'nationwide', 'crusade', 'anti', 'trans', 'legislation', 'center', 'ban', 'transgend', 'youth', 'sport', 'proposal', 'time', 'consider', 'extreme', 'political', 'optic', 'attack', 'people', 'soon', 'obergefell', 'ruling', 'poor', 'memory', 'north', 'carolina', 'disastrous', 'bathroom', 'ban', 'fresh', 'law', 'force', 'trans', 'people', 'use', 'restroom', 'align', 'gender', 'identity', 'backfire', 'spectacularly', 'widely', 'credit', 'help', 'sink', 'republican', 'prospect', 'midterm', 'state', 'republicans', 'identify', 'sport', 'way', 'foot', 'door', 'discrimination', 'president', 'american', 'principle', 'project', 'terry', 'schilling', 'detail', 'case', 'woman', 'sport', 'issue', 'beginning', 'point', 'helping', 'expose', 'get', 'opponent', 'lgbt', 'movement', 'comfortable', 'talk', 'transgender', 'issue', 'year', 'follow', 'volume', 'severity', 'anti', 'trans', 'legislation', 'escalate', 'dramatically', 'bill', 'propose', 'legislative', 'session', 'raise', 'ceiling', 'republican', 'consider', 'politically', 'palatable', 'sport', 'ban', 'fringe', 'boilerplate', 'year', 'state', 'pass', 'sport', 'ban', 'move', 'swiftly', 'criminalize', 'gender', 'affirm', 'care', 'drag', 'ban', 'bathroom', 'restriction', 'emerge', 'new', 'line', 'attack', 'today', 'extreme', 'measure', 'commonplace', 'republicans', 'set', 'sight', 'broad', 'target', 'ban', 'd', 'change', 'adult', 'healthcare', 'restriction', 'increasingly', 'punitive', 'measure', 'chip', 'away', 'basic', 'legal', 'recognition', 'trans', 'life', 'bill', 'propose', 'criminalize', 'transgender', 'identity', 'altogether', 'staggering', 'bill', 'introduce', 'target', 'transgender', 'people', 'united', 'states', 'ban', 'gender', 'affirm', 'care', 'segment', 'trans', 'population', 'seek', 'bar', 'transgender', 'people', 'certain', 'bathroom', 'threat', 'tangible', 'arrest', 'alleged', 'wrong', 'bathroom', 'usage', 'begin', 'mount', 'seventy', 'bill', 'aim', 'eliminate', 'legal', 'recognition', 'transgender', 'people', 'entirely', 'revoke', 'update', 'driver', 'license', 'strip', 'correct', 'gender', 'marker', 'invalidate', 'identification', 'document', 'target', 'drag', 'transgend', 'people', 'dress', 'wrong', 'clothe', 'require', 'school', 'forcibly', 'transgender', 'student', 'new', 'especially', 'chilling', 'category', 'classify', 'gender', 'affirm', 'care', 'social', 'transition', 'child', 'abuse', 'open', 'door', 'state', 'sanction', 'removal', 'trans', 'youth', 'supportive', 'home', 'far', 'anti', 'trans', 'bill', 'sign', 'law', 'year', 'advance', 'state', 'legislature', 'state', 'legislature', 'escalate', 'assault', 'transgender', 'right', 'federal', 'government', 'trump', 'double', 'punish', 'blue', 'state', 'protective', 'law', 'ban', 'transgender', 'people', 'military', 'service', 'investigate', 'teacher', 'affirm', 'trans', 'student', 'defunde', 'hospital', 'provide', 'care', 'target', 'organization', 'simply', 'acknowledge', 'word', 'transgender', 'scope', 'intensity', 'punishing', 'year', 'transgender', 'people', 'america', 'goal', 'unmistakable', 'nearly', 'impossible', 'transgender', 'people', 'live', 'openly', 'safely', 'dignity', 'public', 'life']",
4f52f6c4-15c5-4096-8dfd-ef712b850065,pro,"judge blocks passport ban for plaintiffs, citing government animus and equal protection","['judge', 'block', 'passport', 'ban', 'plaintiff', 'cite', 'government', 'animus', 'equal', 'protection']",erin in the morning,erin reed,https://www.erininthemorning.com/p/judge-blocks-passport-ban-citing,4/18/2025,"in a landmark decision issued late friday, a federal judge granted a preliminary injunction blocking the trump administration’s passport policy targeting transgender americans. the executive order, which required that passport gender markers reflect a person’s assigned sex at birth, effectively reversed three decades of precedent and left many applications stalled in bureaucratic limbo. the judge ruled the policy was “arbitrary and capricious,” likely in violation of the administrative procedure act, the paperwork reduction act, and the equal protection clause of the u.s. constitution. the judge also ruled that the decision was based in animus and discrimination towards transgender people. while the injunction currently applies only to the named plaintiffs, a broader ruling protecting all transgender americans is expected in the coming weeks.

“the plaintiffs have also demonstrated a likelihood of success on their separate argument that, under any standard of review, the executive order and passport policy are based on irrational prejudice toward transgender americans and therefore offend our nation’s constitutional commitment to equal protection for all americans. in addition, the plaintiffs have shown that they are likely to succeed on their claim that the passport policy is arbitrary and capricious, and that it was not adopted in compliance with the procedures required by the paperwork reduction act and administrative procedure act,” ruled the judge.

the judge, when evaluating whether or not the transgender plaintiffs were being discriminated against in a way that likely violates their equal protection under the law, ruled that they likely were. this is because the order targets transgender people based on sex, an act that triggers a higher degree of constitutional scrutiny: “as to the first policy change, applicants are explicitly treated differently based on their sex assigned at birth. a person who identifies as female can receive a passport marked “f” if her sex assigned at birth was female, but not if her sex assigned at birth was male. likewise, a person who identifies as male can receive a passport marked “m” if his sex assigned at birth was male, but not if his sex assigned at birth was female… viewed from any angle, that amounts to a classification based on sex.”

once the judge determined that the policy classified on sex, the government must prove that it used the least restrictive way to achieve an important government objective in an “exceedingly persuasive manner.” the trump executive order argued that the change was needed to protect the safety of cisgender women. the judge found this unpersuasive, ruling, “there is no connection between the state department’s prior policy—which allowed applicants to obtain personal-use passports consistent with their gender identity—and any deprivation of cisgender women’s dignity, safety, and well-being… marriages)…. the government further offers no explanation for how a policy that allowed all individuals to obtain passports reflective of their gender identity had a “corrosive impact” on women and “the validity of the entire american system.” eo § 1. any such argument would strain logic, and so it is not surprising that the government does not try to justify the passport policy by reference to the stated purposes of the executive order.”

the judge also found that the administration’s decision to block passport gender marker changes for transgender people was rooted in anti-transgender animus, rendering the policy likely unconstitutional under any level of judicial scrutiny. in reaching this conclusion, the ruling considered not only the passport policy in isolation, but its context alongside other contemporaneous executive actions—most notably, the transgender military ban, in which the government argued that transgender individuals were inherently dishonorable and untruthful. these actions, the judge wrote, “convey a fundamental moral disapproval of transgender americans.”

the judge also ruled that the passport ban was arbitrary and capricious, failing to meet the standards required by the administrative procedures act and the paperwork reduction act. major rule changes typically require agencies to post proposed changes to the federal register, allow for public comment, and assess stakeholder input before altering official forms or procedures. the trump administration bypassed that process entirely, imposing the passport policy by executive fiat—banning transgender people from receiving passports with accurate gender markers with the stroke of a pen. “there is no evidence before the court that, in adopting the passport policy, the agency defendants took steps to identify facts bearing on its policy change, attempted to identify potential reliance interests, or sought to determine how any such interests may be impacted by the policy changes,” the judge wrote.

following these determinations, the judge ruled in favor of a preliminary injunction blocking the new passport policy. though the ruling currently applies only to the plaintiffs, it is widely expected to expand in the coming weeks to cover the full class of transgender americans. it joins a series of federal court decisions in recent months halting trump administration policies targeting transgender people, reinforcing a growing judicial record that identifies inescapable anti-transgender animus in their design. that pattern may ultimately form the legal backbone for dismantling trump’s broader agenda—and could mark a turning point in the courts’ willingness to scrutinize and strike down policies that treat transgender americans as second-class citizens.","['landmark',

e383d8db-84a8-41b6-820e-29b118f61d35,pro,washington state passes bill to cover some 12-month hormone therapy stockpiles,"['washington', 'state', 'pass', 'bill', 'cover', 'month', 'hormone', 'therapy', 'stockpile']",erin in the morning,s. baum,https://www.erininthemorning.com/p/washington-state-passes-bill-to-cover,4/17/2025,"update: washington state democrats have informed me that testosterone was also included in the bill, and although it did not get the 12-month refill period that estrogen did, it did receive an extension to 6 months for refills. the story has been updated to correct this.

washington state made history on wednesday when it became the first state in the country to pass legislation increasing access to hormone therapy.

hb 1971 declares that health care plans who cover hormone treatments “must provide reimbursement for a 12-month refill of covered prescription hormone therapy obtained at one time by the enrollee,” unless a doctor prescribes otherwise or the hormone in question is a controlled substance. testosterone, due to being a controlled substance, was extended from 3-month refills to 6-month refills.

the bill received bipartisan support in the state senate, passing 40-9, including six republicans. all nine votes against the bill were from the gop.

senator keith wagoner was one such republican who voted in favor of hb 1971. he said he he was supporting the policy in spite of “fringes” online which had “inflamed” public debate by focusing squarely on the hrt’s association with trans-affirming care.

“that is such a small part of what this bill does,” wagoner told the senate. he said he was speaking out in part because his own daughter relies on hormone therapy. as a survivor of brain cancer, which impacted her pituitary gland, she will likely be taking hormones for the rest of her life. the current timeframe for receiving hormones, which may limit people to a six-month, three-month or one-month supply, is a constant stressor for his family, he said.

“the bill will alleviate a lot of suffering,” wagoner concluded.

in a press release, planned parenthood alliance advocates lauded washington as the first state in the country to pass legislation improving access to hormone therapies. while president donald trump has called hrt “chemical [...] mutilation” as part of his broader war on “gender ideology,” it is mostly used for menopause, polycystic ovary syndrome (pcos), hyperandrogenism, and cancer survivors.

courtney normand, the washington state director of ppaa, said in a statement that hb 1971 would help marginalized groups who otherwise struggle to access health care. “this bill is especially critical for our rural neighbors, those without transportation, people working multiple jobs, communities with low incomes or without wealth, and those who have long faced systemic discrimination,” she said.

the bill is also a welcome protection for the growing number of trans people being targeted by the government.

“every day we fear losing access to gender affirming hormone therapy, and many are already rationing medication to build a reserve, myself included,” said jenna comstock, who sits on the board of directors for washington’s lgbtq bar association, during a prior hearing on the bill. “requiring health plans to provide hormone coverage to reimburse 12-month refills would help trans washingtonians secure access to their medications, mitigating some harms of this uncertain political climate.""","['update', 'washington', 'state', 'democrats', 'inform', 'testosterone', 'include', 'bill', 'month', 'refill', 'period', 'estrogen', 'receive', 'extension', 'month', 'refill', 'story', 'update', 'correct', 'washington', 'state', 'history', 'wednesday', 'state', 'country', 'pass', 'legislation', 'increase', 'access', 'hormone', 'therapy', 'hb', 'declare', 'health', 'care', 'plan', 'cover', 'hormone', 'treatment', 'provide', 'reimbursement', 'month', 'refill', 'cover', 'prescription', 'hormone', 'therapy', 'obtain', 'time', 'enrollee', 'doctor', 'prescribe', 'hormone', 'question', 'control', 'substance', 'testosterone', 'control', 'substance', 'extend', 'month', 'refill', 'month', 'refill', 'bill', 'receive', 'bipartisan', 'support', 'state', 'senate', 'pass', 'include', 'republican', 'vote', 'bill', 'gop', 'senator', 'keith', 'wagoner', 'republican', 'vote', 'favor', 'hb', 'say', 'support', 'policy', 'spite', 'fringe', 'online', 'inflame', 'public', 'debate', 'focus', 'squarely', 'hrt', 'association', 'trans', 'affirm', 'care', 'small', 'bill', 'wagoner', 'tell', 'senate', 'say', 'speak', 'daughter', 'rely', 'hormone', 'therapy', 'survivor', 'brain', 'cancer', 'impact', 'pituitary', 'gland', 'likely', 'take', 'hormone', 'rest', 'life', 'current', 'timeframe', 'receive', 'hormone', 'limit', 'people', 'month', 'month', 'month', 'supply', 'constant', 'stressor', 'family', 'say', 'bill', 'alleviate', 'lot', 'suffering', 'wagoner', 'conclude', 'press', 'release', 'plan', 'parenthood', 'alliance', 'advocate', 'laud', 'washington', 'state', 'country', 'pass', 'legislation', 'improve', 'access', 'hormone', 'therapy', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'call', 'hrt', 'chemical', 'mutilation', 'broad', 'war', 'gender', 'ideology', 'menopause', 'polycystic', 'ovary', 'syndrome', 'pcos', 'hyperandrogenism', 'cancer', 'survivor', 'courtney', 'normand', 'washington', 'state', 'director', 'ppaa', 'say', 'statement', 'hb', 'help', 'marginalized', 'group', 'struggle', 'access', 'health', 'care', 'bill', 'especially', 'critical', 'rural', 'neighbor', 'transportation', 'people', 'work', 'multiple', 'job', 'community', 'low', 'income', 'wealth', 'long', 'face', 'systemic', 'discrimination', 'say', 'bill', 'welcome', 'protection', 'grow', 'number', 'tran', 'people', 'target', 'government', 'day', 'fear', 'lose', 'access', 'gender', 'affirm', 'hormone', 'therapy', 'ration', 'medication', 'build', 'reserve', 'include', 'say', 'jenna', 'comstock', 'sit', 'board', 'director', 'washington', 'lgbtq', 'bar', 'association', 'prior', 'hearing', 'bill', 'require', 'health', 'plan', 'provide', 'hormone', 'coverage', 'reimburse', 'month', 'refill', 'help', 'trans', 'washingtonians', 'secure', 'access', 'medication', 'mitigate', 'harm', 'uncertain', 'political', 'climate']",

on friday, april 11, patients reported receiving calls that gender affirming care was being put on “pause” after the department of health and human services sent out a memo to medical institutions across the country. the letter warned institutions that receive federal funding against providing gender affirming care. planned parenthood arizona is the only branch of the organization reported to have paused care as a result.

in a voicemail left to one of the patients, a planned parenthood worker told one patient that they were “hoping that this is a temporary pause for the next week.”

but by the weekend, lookout—an arizona-based lgbtq news site—had broken the story about the cancellations. a banner was added to the organization’s website that said, “planned parenthood arizona is pausing gender affirming care services as we continue to review and evaluate this order. we are committed to keeping our patients updated about the services we provide and will communicate further once we can provide more information.”

by monday, erin in the morning and other news outlets picked up the story. and by tuesday, the group reversed course. erin in the morning had reached out to planned parenthood arizona for comment but did not hear back in time for publication.

a new banner on the website reads:

“planned parenthood arizona deeply values and is dedicated to the lgbtqia+ community, which includes our patients, supporters, and staff. we recognize how critical it is for our patients to have certainty to access essential services, including gender affirming care.

after a brief pause, we are pleased to announce the continuation of our gender affirming care services. this pause occurred out of an abundance of caution after threats to the medicaid services in our state.

the onslaught of attacks on sexual and reproductive health care services in arizona and across the country is alarming, and is a clear, continued effort to shut down planned parenthood. this will not be the last threat that aims to deny people medically sound, essential health care, needlessly putting them at risk and unnecessarily creating chaos and confusion around the accessibility of services.”

no publicly known legal action had been taken against planned parenthood arizona at the time of its pause on care. critics said the move was an act of “overcompliance.” it marks a minor notch in a wider trend seen at medical institutions across the country—such as at nyu langone, denver health and the children’s hospital of los angeles—of capitulation to anti-trans health care orders.","['plan', 'parenthood', 'arizona', 'reinstate', 'care', 'trans', 'patient', 'follow', 'public', 'outcry', 'friday', 'april', 'patient', 'report', 'receive', 'call', 'gender', 'affirm', 'care', 'pause', 'department', 'health', 'human', 'service', 'send', 'memo', 'medical', 'institution', 'country', 'letter', 'warn', 'institution', 'receive', 'federal', 'funding', 'provide', 'gender', 'affirm', 'care', 'plan', 'parenthood', 'arizona', 'branch', 'organization', 'report', 'pause', 'care', 'result', 'voicemail', 'leave', 'patient', 'plan', 'parenthood', 'worker', 'tell', 'patient', 'hope', 'temporary', 'pause', 'week', 'weekend', 'lookout', 'arizona', 'base', 'lgbtq', 'news', 'site', 'break', 'story', 'cancellation', 'banner', 'add', 'organization', 'website', 'say', 'plan', 'parenthood', 'arizona', 'pause', 'gender', 'affirm', 'care', 'service', 'continue', 'review', 'evaluate', 'order', 'commit', 'keep', 'patient', 'update', 'service', 'provide', 'communicate', 'provide', 'information', 'monday', 'erin', 'morning', 'news', 'outlet', 'pick', 'story', 'tuesday', 'group', 'reverse', 'course', 'erin', 'morning', 'reach', 'plan', 'parenthood', 'arizona', 'comment', 'hear', 'time', 'publication', 'new', 'banner', 'website', 'read', 'plan', 'parenthood', 'arizona', 'deeply', 'value', 'dedicate', 'community', 'include', 'patient', 'supporter', 'staff', 'recognize', 'critical', 'patient', 'certainty', 'access', 'essential', 'service', 'include', 'gender', 'affirm', 'care', 'brief', 'pause', 'pleased', 'announce', 'continuation', 'gender', 'affirm', 'care', 'service', 'pause', 'occur', 'abundance', 'caution', 'threat', 'medicaid', 'service', 'state', 'onslaught', 'attack', 'sexual', 'reproductive', 'health', 'care', 'service', 'arizona', 'country', 'alarming', 'clear', 'continued', 'effort', 'shut', 'plan', 'parenthood', 'threat', 'aim', 'deny', 'people', 'medically', 'sound', 'essential', 'health', 'care', 'needlessly', 'put', 'risk', 'unnecessarily', 'create', 'chaos', 'confusion', 'accessibility', 'service', 'publicly', 'know', 'legal', 'action', 'take', 'plan', 'parenthood', 'arizona', 'time', 'pause', 'care', 'critic', 'say', 'act', 'overcompliance', 'mark', 'minor', 'notch', 'wide', 'trend', 'see', 'medical', 'institution', 'country', 'nyu', 'langone', 'denver', 'health', 'child', 'hospital', 'los', 'angeles', 'capitulation', 'anti', 'trans', 'health', 'care', 'order']",

many transgender people have told me they are planning or actively working to leave the united states—and some have already done so successfully. most are using existing immigration pathways, such as job-based visas or close family ties in safer countries. but not every trans person has a high-demand skillset along with a job lined up abroad or a family connection that eases their way through immigration. still, the writing is on the wall: when conservative leaders openly talk about “eradication” and declare the elimination of all gender-affirming care their “endgame,” the calculation many trans people make is a grim one—that safety may no longer be possible within u.s. borders.

this is a reasonable calculation for transgender people to make. week after week, the administration’s policies grow more punitive. in its opening salvo, trump’s executive order banning transgender people from the military declared them inherently “dishonorable, untruthful, and undisciplined”—an official government stance. since then, any organization committing the supposed sin of acknowledging transgender people has been threatened with the loss of federal funding. that threat has proven so effective that even lgbtq+ health clinics have stripped mentions of transgender people from their websites. and in one of the most flagrant examples of historical erasure, the government-edited page for sylvia rivera at stonewall national monument now claims she fought for “gay and rights,” omitting the word “transgender” in what can only be described as digital book burning—part of a broader campaign to erase trans people from public memory.

since then, policy after policy has chipped away at what few rights transgender people retained in the united states, reducing them to second-class citizens. the administration has cracked down on medical care, issuing executive orders that ban gender-affirming treatment for those up to age 19, with recent letters hinting at an expansion to age 21. passports are being delayed or denied. transgender people have been denied entry to the country for having legal documents that don’t match their sex assigned at birth—such as trans musician bells larsen, who detailed his experience this week after being denied a visa. it’s becoming harder to argue that the systematic stripping of legal recognition, medical access, and freedom of movement does not constitute a crisis—one worthy of international recognition and response.

many other countries are beginning to recognize the loss of safety for transgender people in the united states. entire countries such as france, denmark, finland, and germany have warned their transgender citizens about the risks of traveling to the u.s.","['situation', 'transgender', 'people', 'united', 'states', 'unravel', 'alarming', 'pace', 'teacher', 'face', 'criminal', 'investigation', 'threat', 'basic', 'act', 'respect', 'student', 'medical', 'care', 'transgender', 'youth', 'adult', 'gutte', 'entire', 'state', 'see', 'widespread', 'service', 'shutdown', 'trump', 'administration', 'move', 'erase', 'transgender', 'history', 'public', 'institution', 'end', 'legal', 'recognition', 'altogether', 'passport', 'identification', 'document', 'flag', 'transgender', 'visa', 'seeker', 'deny', 'entry', 'united', 'states', 'promise', 'policy', 'stop', 'margin', 'reality', 'clear', 'life', 'transgender', 'person', 'america', 'unlivable', 'time', 'come', 'country', 'strong', 'human', 'right', 'protection', 'extend', 'refuge', 'long', 'exist', 'safely', 'openly', 'border', 'transgender', 'people', 'tell', 'plan', 'actively', 'work', 'leave', 'united', 'states', 'successfully', 'exist', 'immigration', 'pathway', 'job', 'base', 'visa', 'close', 'family', 'tie', 'safe', 'country', 'trans', 'person', 'high', 'demand', 'skillset', 'job', 'line', 'abroad', 'family', 'connection', 'ease', 'way', 'immigration', 'writing', 'wall', 'conservative', 'leader', 'openly', 'talk', 'eradication', 'declare', 'elimination', 'gender', 'affirming', 'care', 'endgame', 'calculation', 'trans', 'people', 'grim', 'safety', 'long', 'possible', 'border', 'reasonable', 'calculation', 'transgender', 'people', 'week', 'week', 'administration', 'policy', 'grow', 'punitive', 'opening', 'salvo', 'trump', 'executive', 'order', 'ban', 'transgender', 'people', 'military', 'declare', 'inherently', 'dishonorable', 'untruthful', 'official', 'government', 'stance', 'organization', 'commit', 'suppose', 'sin', 'acknowledge', 'transgender', 'people', 'threaten', 'loss', 'federal', 'funding', 'threat', 'prove', 'effective', 'health', 'clinic', 'strip', 'mention', 'transgender', 'people', 'website', 'flagrant', 'example', 'historical', 'erasure', 'government', 'edit', 'page', 'sylvia', 'rivera', 'stonewall', 'national', 'monument', 'claim', 'fight', 'gay', 'right', 'omit', 'word', 'transgender', 'describe', 'digital', 'book', 'burning', 'broad', 'campaign', 'erase', 'tran', 'people', 'public', 'memory', 'policy', 'policy', 'chip', 'away', 'right', 'transgender', 'people', 'retain', 'united', 'states', 'reduce', 'second', 'class', 'citizen', 'administration', 'crack', 'medical', 'care', 'issue', 'executive', 'order', 'ban', 'gender', 'affirm', 'treatment', 'age', 'recent', 'letter', 'hint', 'expansion', 'age', 'passport', 'delay', 'deny', 'transgender', 'people', 'deny', 'entry', 'country', 'have', 'legal', 'document', 'match', 'sex', 'assign', 'birth', 'trans', 'musician', 'bell', 'larsen', 'detail', 'experience', 'week', 'deny', 'visa', 'hard', 'argue', 'systematic', 'stripping', 'legal', 'recognition', 'medical', 'access', 'freedom', 'movement', 'constitute', 'crisis', 'worthy', 'international', 'recognition', 'response', 'country', 'begin', 'recognize', 'loss', 'safety', 'transgender', 'people', 'united', 'states', 'entire', 'country', 'france', 'denmark', 'finland', 'germany', 'warn', 'transgender', 'citizen', 'risk', 'travel']",
211c6ec9-70a9-4bc7-941f-34af11ad64b7,pro,hhs launches snitch form to report gender affirming care providers,"['hhs', 'launch', 'snitch', 'form', 'report', 'gender', 'affirm', 'care', 'provider']",erin in the morning,s. baum,https://www.erininthemorning.com/p/hhs-launches-snitch-form-to-report,4/15/2025,"the department of health and human services (hhs), run by famed vaccine skeptic and legacy hire robert f. kennedy jr., has launched an online portal for “whistleblowers” reporting medical providers if they offer gender affirming treatment to trans people—an alarming escalation of president donald trump’s unconstitutional war on trans people’s health care.

on april 14, the hhs released accompanying legal guidance on how to subvert privacy laws and disclose sensitive information about doctors and their patients to a hostile government entity. it does not say that reports must be about violations of the law; it seems to encourage the reporting of any action taken by a provider that is at odds with trump’s anti-trans executive order 14187, titled “protecting children from chemical and surgical mutilation,” regardless of actual state and federal law.

“please reference eo 14187 in your complaint,” the portal notes. meanwhile, the guidance says it ensures “robust anti-retaliation protections for individuals who make a report in order to ensure compliance with the executive order.”

it further says that a report should be filed by anyone with “a good faith belief” that a medical provider’s actions “violates professional or clinical standards.” while this is not a wholly unheard of protection for whistleblowers, trump’s eo rebuked the widely-accepted clinical standards set forth by the world professional association for transgender health (wpath). in doing so, he may have opened up the floodgates for any federal agency to create new “standards” to fit his own anti-trans agenda.

calling trans-affirming care “chemical and surgical mutilation” is an unscientific dog whistle used by the far-right (and trump’s eo) to characterize evidence-based, trans-affirming care. notably, such care—including puberty blockers and hormone replacement therapy—does not categorically and universally lead to irreversible “sterilization” as erroneously asserted by the eo. meanwhile, the trump administration has gone to great lengths to ensure that the practice of invasive, permanent, and unnecessary surgeries on intersex children remains intact.

trump’s eo was blocked by multiple federal judges, at least temporarily, but this has not stopped federal agencies from trying to enforce it anyway. the aclu and other civil rights groups have called on the courts to take bolder action in enforcing its injunction.

u.s. district judge lauren king said the executive order violates constitutional protections by “treating people differently based on sex or transgender status.”

“[t]he order is not limited to children, or to irreversible treatments, nor does it target any similar medical interventions performed on cisgender youth,” king wrote in a february ruling. “for example, a cisgender teen could obtain puberty blockers from such a provider as a component of cancer treatment, but a transgender teen with the same cancer care plan could not.”

even more, the new hhs guidance latches on to the church amendments. this 1976 provision shields medical staff from disciplinary or legal action if they refuse to provide or aid an abortion or other lawful reproductive health care practice, as long as it is done so on the basis of “his religious beliefs or moral convictions respecting sterilization procedures.”

it appears trump’s eo, in characterizing trans-affirming care as “sterilization,” is further weaponizing the decades-old anti-abortion law to empower anti-trans initiatives.

“the church amendments protect employees from discrimination if, based on religious beliefs or moral convictions, they refuse to participate in child-mutilation procedures—including the use of puberty-blockers or cross-sex hormones—and/or raise an objection to a supervisor about participating in such procedures,” the new hhs guidance says.

at the start of trump’s second term, the department of justice dropped four felony charges that it had filed against dr. ethan haim, a surgeon who had completed his residency at texas children’s hospital. prosecutors said he violated hipaa with “intent to cause malicious harm” when, in 2023, he evidently took confidential patient records pertaining to minors who were not under his care, under false pretenses, and then leaked the documents to the far-right press.

the hospital had publicly announced it would cease gender affirming therapies for trans patients in 2022. however, it was not illegal to provide this kind of care when haim targeted the pediatric hospital. haim self-identifies as a “whistleblower.”

this week, haim took center stage at a congressional hearing dedicated to bolstering legal protections for doctors who violate the law in the name of trump’s anti-trans agenda. ""i wouldn't want this to be done to anyone, not even liberals, even if they're the craziest communists ever,"" haim said during the hearing. ""there's no one in this country who should be falsely accused and the entire power of the federal government be brought down on them."" (it is unclear what the false accusations in question are, as haim fully admitted to leaking the documents.)

prosecutors did not provide an explanation for dropping the charges, but haim told the new york times he believed that he had president trump to thank for it. “he’s my man,” haim said.

trump has waged war on whistleblowers in almost every other circumstance—including by firing the head of the government watchdog agency established to protect them.","['department', 'health', 'human',

a3b772d8-9685-4ba9-a5ef-c9961c1ac0e2,pro,the trump administration threat to transgender adult care is growing at lightning speed,"['trump', 'administration', 'threat', 'transgender', 'adult', 'care', 'grow', 'lightning', 'speed']",erin in the morning,erin reed,https://www.erininthemorning.com/p/the-trump-administration-threat-to,4/15/2025,"the assault on transgender adult healthcare has long been a quiet undercurrent in right-wing circles—now, it's breaking into full view. anti-trans organizations have floated raising the age limit for care to 25 for years, and gop architects of youth care bans have been explicit: the real goal is to eliminate gender-affirming care entirely. donald trump himself has vowed in the past to target trans healthcare “at any age.” now, with a new letter from the centers for medicare and medicaid services (cms) circulating to clinics nationwide, the first formal warning shots have been fired. transgender adults should take notice—and prepare. the infrastructure to strip their care is already being built.

according to a recent cms letter, clinics across the country are being warned against providing gender-affirming care to individuals under the age of 21. “federal financial participation (ffp) is strictly limited for procedures, treatments, or operations for the purpose of rendering an individual permanently incapable of reproducing and, under 42 c.f.r. 441.253(a), is specifically prohibited for such procedures performed on a person under age 21,” the letter reads, citing a 1978 regulation restricting federal funding for sterilization. but gender-affirming care for adults rarely meets that definition. many transgender men and women retain the ability to have children after temporarily stopping hormone therapy, and fertility counseling is routinely offered. when sterilization does occur, it is not the goal of the care—it is an incidental outcome of treatment meant to alleviate gender dysphoria.

more troubling is the use of this decades-old regulation to pressure health care centers into dropping transgender care for adults. the expansion of restrictions to include people up to the age of 21 follows a recent trump executive order barring gender-affirming care for anyone under 19—a category that includes legal adults. although that order has been blocked in multiple courts, hospitals have still used it to justify halting care for this population. now, the cms letter is having a similar chilling effect: planned parenthood of arizona has “paused” gender-affirming care for all adult patients. this is a deeply alarming development, especially considering that planned parenthood is the largest—and often the only—provider of transgender adult healthcare in many parts of the country.

it appears increasingly likely that the trump administration is preparing to target transgender adult healthcare nationwide. in his campaign video, trump stated he intends to investigate gender-affirming care for transgender people of any age. at the same time, reports indicate the department of health and human services is preparing to release a junk science review targeting both transgender youth and adults, with one internal letter referencing plans to study the “chemical and surgical mutilation of children and adults.” the warning signs for transgender adults are blaring: when republican legislators say behind closed doors that their goal is to end gender-affirming care “for everyone,” and when figures like michael knowles call for the “eradication” of transgender people at cpac, this is what it looks like when those words begin turning into action.

it would not take much for transgender adult care to be severely disrupted. the forthcoming hhs report could be used to justify a national executive order threatening hospital funding for any institution that treats transgender adults. given the widespread over-compliance already seen in response to executive orders with no statutory authority—whether around dei rollbacks, the erasure of lgbtq+ people, censorship of aids/hiv prevention resources, removal of critical historical narratives, or retaliation against law firms that challenge the administration—such an order could have sweeping, chilling effects. the threat of investigations alone could freeze care for countless trans people, forcing providers to pause services out of fear. these disruptions are already underway in arizona following planned parenthood’s decision to halt transgender care—an early indication of the nationwide consequences should the trump administration continue its campaign against transgender people unchecked.

such steps have already been implemented in a state that appears to be a model for the trump administration’s approach: florida. in 2023, the state issued standards of care that led to sweeping rollbacks in access to gender-affirming care for both youth and adults—amounting to an effective ban for many. that was followed by further restrictions on providers, which resulted in the elimination of 80% of all transgender adult care in the state. many transgender adults in florida have since been forced to cross state lines to access basic medical treatment, and the number of in-state providers has plummeted under the weight of these new regulations.

many transgender people have already begun taking steps to protect their access to care. if you are a transgender adult, it may be worthwhile to explore the options available to you. some have worked with providers to secure multi-month prescriptions, a precaution many providers are now increasingly willing to accommodate. others have chosen to slightly reduce their dosage to build up a reserve in case of long-term disruption. still others have turned to gray-market or international sources for hormone therapy. while this publication does not endorse any specific course of action, it is important to research the available options and make informed decisions based on your circumstances.","['assault', 'transgender', 'adult', 'healthcare', 'long', 'quiet', 'undercurrent', 'right',

36b35318-78f1-4f31-9122-f154b11272e7,pro,planned parenthood of arizona “pauses” gender affirming care for trans adults,"['plan', 'parenthood', 'arizona', 'pause', 'gender', 'affirm', 'care', 'tran', 'adult']",erin in the morning,s. baum,https://www.erininthemorning.com/p/planned-parenthood-of-arizona-pauses,4/14/2025,"clariece, a 23-year-old trans woman in mesa, arizona, said she got the phone call late on friday from her planned parenthood doctor’s office. it was in regards to her routine appointment that monday—the office was cancelling her visit, and all upcoming visits for trans patients seeking gender affirming care in the coming week.

“we are hoping that this is a temporary pause for the next week,” a representative said, as per a voicemail left to clariece. the office said they would reach out when they knew they could reschedule.

clareice was able to find another provider—missing even a week of hormone replacement therapy can be destabilizing, and it can be a major setback due to the stringent regulations on hormones for trans patients—but since getting the call, she says she’s felt ""the sword of damocles” hanging over her head.

“even a little bump can push back when you go and see somebody, which pushes back when you get your lab work, which pushes back when you can get a new prescription written, and that all means there will probably be a gap,” she told erin in the morning. (she spoke on the condition that her last name be omitted from publication due to privacy concerns.)

by saturday, april 12, erin in the morning reported that the planned parenthood of arizona had added a new banner on its website.

“at this time, planned parenthood arizona is pausing gender affirming care services,” the header reads. “we are committed to keeping our patients updated about the services we provide and will communicate further once we can provide more information.”

it says the catalyst for the stoppage was an april 11 letter from the centers for medicare and medicaid services (cms) which ordered medicaid agencies to halt funding for any clinics that provide gender affirming care for trans people.

the cms is a government agency led by mehmet oz—a doctor-turned-media-mogul-turned-politician whose claim to fame is promoting dangerous “miracle” (pseudoscientific) weight loss drugs and cancer cures to a live studio audience via the dr. oz show.

“initiated with an underdeveloped body of evidence, [gender affirming] interventions lack reliable evidence of long-term benefits for minors,” the cms letter reads.

put simply, this is not true. every major medical association supports affirming health care for transgender youth. meanwhile, the cms letter cites southern poverty law center-designated hate groups known for dubious, anti-lgbt “science,” such as do no harm, which was founded to stop “woke” health care, and the society for evidence-based gender medicine, which pushes conversion therapy for trans kids.

but the planned parenthood of arizona’s pause on care is not just about kids; adults are also barred from gender affirming care.

planned parenthood did not respond to requests for comment.

in 2021, dr. bhavik kumar, the medical director of primary and trans care at planned parenthood gulf coast, told npr that over 35,000 patients nationwide had sought gender affirming hormone replacement therapy at planned parenthood clinics that year.

according to kumar, in areas where gender affirming care is sparse, planned parenthood may be the only place where transgender people can access health care, period.

""when that's taken away,” he said, “they're left sometimes with no options.”

meanwhile, many scholars have denounced medical institutions for over-complying with attacks on trans-affirming care. in new york, activists plastered protest signs on sites associated with nyu langone, which went above and beyond the law (if not against the law) when it cancelled medical appointments for trans youth. and protestors have gathered at hospitals across the country calling on health care providers to support trans patients.

gender affirming care bans are “intentionally vague,” according to rev. jasmine beach-ferrara, executive director of the campaign for southern equality, in a 2023 report on such bans. she said that this serves to intimidate and pressure providers of gender affirming care for trans people. the report found that “overcompliance leads to compounding harms for transgender youth.”

“we’ve seen medical institutions shutter services that they are not legally required to, and we’ve seen illegal denials of pharmaceutical care,” she said. “as advocates fight these laws in the courts and on the ground, we urge medical providers, pharmacies, and communities at large to not make this crisis worse through overcompliance with the law.”","['clariece', 'year', 'old', 'trans', 'woman', 'mesa', 'arizona', 'say', 'get', 'phone', 'late', 'friday', 'plan', 'parenthood', 'doctor', 'office', 'regard', 'routine', 'appointment', 'monday', 'office', 'cancel', 'visit', 'upcoming', 'visit', 'trans', 'patient', 'seek', 'gender', 'affirm', 'care', 'come', 'week', 'hope', 'temporary', 'pause', 'week', 'representative', 'say', 'voicemail', 'leave', 'clariece', 'office', 'say', 'reach', 'know', 'reschedule', 'clareice', 'able', 'find', 'provider', 'miss', 'week', 'hormone', 'replacement', 'therapy', 'destabilizing', 'major', 'setback', 'stringent', 'regulation', 'hormone', 'trans', 'patient', 'get', 'say', 'feel', 'sword', 'damocle', 'hang', 'head', 'little', 'bump', 'push', 'somebody', 'push', 'lab', 'work', 'push', 'new', 'prescription', 'write', 'mean', 'probably', 'gap', 'tell', 'erin', 'morning', 'speak', 'condition', 'omit', 'publication', 'privacy', 'concern', 'saturday', 'april', 'erin', 'morning', 'report', 'plan', 'parenthood', 'arizona', 'add', 'new', 'banner', 'website', 'time', 'plan', 'parenthood', 'arizona', 'pause', 'gender', 'affirm', 'care', 'service', 'header', 'read', 'commit', 'keep', 'patient', 'update', 'service', 'provide', 'communicate', 'provide', 'information', 'say', 'catalyst', 'stoppage', 'april', 'letter', 'center', 'medicare', 'medicaid', 'service', 'cms', 'order', 'medicaid', 'agency', 'halt', 'funding', 'clinic', 'provide', 'gender', 'affirm', 'care', 'tran', 'people', 'cms', 'government', 'agency', 'lead', 'mehmet', 'oz', 'doctor', 'turn', 'media', 'mogul', 'turn', 'politician', 'claim', 'fame', 'promote', 'dangerous', 'miracle', 'pseudoscientific', 'weight', 'loss', 'drug', 'cancer', 'cure', 'live', 'studio', 'audience', 'dr', 'oz', 'initiate', 'underdeveloped', 'body', 'evidence', 'gender', 'affirm', 'intervention', 'lack', 'reliable', 'evidence', 'long', 'term', 'benefit', 'minor', 'cms', 'letter', 'read', 'simply', 'true', 'major', 'medical', 'association', 'support', 'affirm', 'health', 'care', 'transgender', 'youth', 'cms', 'letter', 'cite', 'southern', 'poverty', 'law', 'center', 'designate', 'hate', 'group', 'know', 'dubious', 'anti', 'lgbt', 'science', 'harm', 'found', 'stop', 'wake', 'health', 'care', 'society', 'evidence', 'base', 'gender', 'medicine', 'push', 'conversion', 'therapy', 'trans', 'kid', 'plan', 'parenthood', 'arizona', 'pause', 'care', 'kid', 'adult', 'bar', 'gender', 'affirming', 'care', 'plan', 'parenthood', 'respond', 'request', 'comment', 'dr', 'bhavik', 'kumar', 'medical', 'director', 'primary', 'trans', 'care', 'plan', 'parenthood', 'gulf', 'coast', 'tell', 'npr', 'patient', 'nationwide', 'seek', 'gender', 'affirm', 'hormone', 'replacement', 'therapy', 'plan', 'parenthood', 'clinic', 'year', 'accord', 'kumar', 'area', 'gender', 'affirm', 'care', 'sparse', 'planned', 'parenthood', 'place', 'transgender', 'people', 'access', 'health', 'care', 'period', 'take', 'away', 'say', 'leave', 'option', 'scholar', 'denounce', 'medical', 'institution', 'comply', 'attack', 'trans', 'affirm', 'care', 'new', 'york', 'activist', 'plaster', 'protest', 'sign', 'site', 'associate', 'nyu', 'langone', 'go', 'law', 'law', 'cancel', 'medical', 'appointment', 'trans', 'youth', 'protestor', 'gather', 'hospital', 'country', 'call', 'health', 'care', 'provider', 'support', 'tran', 'patient', 'gender', 'affirm', 'care', 'ban', 'intentionally', 'vague', 'accord', 'rev', 'jasmine', 'beach', 'ferrara', 'executive', 'director', 'campaign', 'southern', 'equality', 'report', 'ban', 'say', 'serve', 'intimidate', 'pressure', 'provider', 'gender', 'affirm', 'care', 'tran', 'people', 'report', 'find', 'overcompliance', 'lead', 'compound', 'harm', 'transgender', 'youth', 'see', 'medical', 'institution', 'shutter', 'service', 'legally', 'require', 'see', 'illegal', 'denial', 'pharmaceutical', 'care', 'say', 'advocate', 'fight', 'law', 'court', 'ground', 'urge', 'medical', 'provider', 'pharmacy', 'community', 'large', 'crisis', 'bad', 'overcompliance', 'law']",
e1e4cc0f-ef3a-4772-9ce7-82881473a46d,anti,judge says school can ban dads who wear pink xx wristbands to protest boys in girls’ sports,"['judge', 'say', 'school', 'ban', 'dad', 'wear', 'pink', 'xx', 'wristband', 'protest', 'boy', 'girl', 'sport']",daily wire,virginia kruta,https://www.dailywire.com/news/judge-says-school-can-ban-dads-who-wear-pink-xx-wristbands-to-protest-boys-in-girls-sports,4/16/2025,"a federal judge ruled this week that a massachusetts school district can ban parents who wear “disruptive” clothing to school events — including two dads who wore pink wristbands to protest biological males competing in girls’ sports.

according to a report from the boston globe, a federal judge denied the request of two fathers, john doyle and mark callahan, for a preliminary injunction against middleborough public schools. the two claimed the school district’s ban violated their first amendment rights.

the two men had worn pink wristbands with the letters “xx” to several school events, which they said was intended to silently protest the district’s policy allowing transgender students — particularly biological males — to compete in girls’ athletics. school administrators claimed the wristbands made some students feel “unsafe” and disrupted the school environment.

in his ruling, the judge said that public schools are not “traditional public forums,” and that schools have a greater ability to limit certain kinds of expression — particularly if they can justify those limitations as a way to maintain a safe and productive learning environment.

the judge wrote that “school officials are well within their rights to prohibit expressions that they reasonably forecast would cause disruption.”

the fathers had also voiced their concerns at school board meetings, and the court did not prevent them from continuing to do so. the decision only upheld the school’s ban on wearing the wristbands during events held on school property.

supporters of the ruling say it reinforces the idea that schools should protect transgender students from targeted harassment and ensure safe spaces.

critics argue the decision limits free speech and silences dissent about policies they view as harmful to female athletes.","['federal', 'judge', 'rule', 'week', 'massachusetts', 'school', 'district', 'ban', 'parent', 'wear', 'disruptive', 'clothing', 'school', 'event', 'include', 'dad', 'wear', 'pink', 'wristband', 'protest', 'biological', 'male', 'compete', 'girl', 'sport', 'accord', 'report', 'boston', 'globe', 'federal', 'judge', 'deny', 'request', 'father', 'john', 'doyle', 'mark', 'callahan', 'preliminary', 'injunction', 'middleborough', 'public', 'school', 'claim', 'school', 'district', 'ban', 'violate', 'amendment', 'right', 'man', 'wear', 'pink', 'wristband', 'letter', 'xx', 'school', 'event', 'say', 'intend', 'silently', 'protest', 'district', 'policy', 'allow', 'transgender', 'student', 'particularly', 'biological', 'male', 'compete', 'girl', 'athletic', 'school', 'administrator', 'claim', 'wristband', 'student', 'feel', 'unsafe', 'disrupt', 'school', 'environment', 'ruling', 'judge', 'say', 'public', 'school', 'traditional', 'public', 'forum', 'school', 'great', 'ability', 'limit', 'certain', 'kind', 'expression', 'particularly', 'justify', 'limitation', 'way', 'maintain', 'safe', 'productive', 'learning', 'environment', 'judge', 'write', 'school', 'official', 'right', 'prohibit', 'expression', 'reasonably', 'forecast', 'cause', 'disruption', 'father', 'voice', 'concern', 'school', 'board', 'meeting', 'court', 'prevent', 'continue', 'decision', 'uphold', 'school', 'ban', 'wear', 'wristband', 'event', 'hold', 'school', 'property', 'supporter', 'ruling', 'reinforce', 'idea', 'school', 'protect', 'transgender', 'student', 'target', 'harassment', 'ensure', 'safe', 'space', 'critic', 'argue', 'decision', 'limit', 'free', 'speech', 'silence', 'dissent', 'policy', 'view', 'harmful', 'female', 'athlete']",
48315005-0496-4210-926c-8d9bea9ac1c4,anti,exclusive: trump launches investigation into colleges over transgender fencing scandal,"['exclusive', 'trump', 'launch', 'investigation', 'college', 'transgender', 'fence', 'scandal']",daily wire,mary margaret olohan,https://www.dailywire.com/news/exclusive-trump-launches-investigation-into-colleges-over-transgender-fencing-scandal,4/14/2025,"washington—a special administration task force formed by president donald trump has launched investigations into the university of maryland and wagner college after they failed to protect a female athlete penalized for refusing to compete against a male who identifies as a female, the daily wire can first report.

the title ix special investigations team — a joint education department and justice department project — launched a directed investigation monday into the university of maryland over allegations that it not only allowed a male athlete to compete in the women’s category of the usa fencing tournament, but also allowed that male athlete to use women’s-only intimate facilities. 

the special investigations team is also investigating wagner college for its own practices and polices that allegedly allowed that male to compete in female sports and to use female intimate spaces.

both colleges received letters from the title ix special investigations team on monday, the daily wire has learned.

read the letters to the university of maryland and wagner college

officials black-carded and booted 31-year-old stephanie turner from a tournament at the university of maryland for refusing to compete against redmond sullivan, a male who identifies as a woman and who formerly competed against males. usa fencing allowed sullivan, who competes for wagner college, to compete in the women’s tournament, the organization confirmed to the daily wire.

“the nation watched as a female competitor bravely took a knee and forfeited an inherently unfair fencing match after discovering that her opponent was a male,” education department spokeswoman julie hartman told the daily wire. “no woman should have to recuse herself from a match that she trained diligently for because she fears for her safety.

“as a tournament host, university of maryland has a responsibility to follow title ix by not allowing males to compete in female competitions and occupy female-only intimate facilities,” hartman said. “similarly, wagner college has a responsibility to not allow males on female rosters.”

the university of maryland had a responsibility to follow title ix by not allowing men to compete in female competitions or be in women’s spaces, the education department is alleging, arguing that wagner college also had a responsibility to protect female sports from males.

“unlike the biden administration, which weaponized title ix contrary to its meaning to deny female athletes their civil rights, the trump administration’s department of education and the department of justice’s title ix special investigations team will not allow recipients of federal funding to deny women’s equal opportunity protections under the law,” hartman said.

“i want to thank god for trusting me with this mission to fight for female exclusive sports and putting me in a place to effectively protest,” turner told the daily wire in a statement in early april. during the competition, she took a knee and forfeited the match to her male opponent.

about a week after the incident, wagner college confirmed to fox news digital that the male athlete is no longer on its women’s team.

the trump administration created the title ix special investigations team after receiving a “staggering volume” of title ix complaints. both the education and justice departments have been vocal about title ix situations in california, maine, and other states.

the agencies repeatedly point to trump’s executive orders protecting female student athletes from having “to compete with or against or having to appear unclothed before males,” as well as trump’s order “defending women from gender ideology extremism.” 

“under the biden administration, title ix was weaponized contrary to its meaning to deny women their equal opportunity protections under the law,” hartman told the daily wire earlier this month. “schools allowed male competitors to strip female athletes of their rightful accolades, threaten women’s safety, and subject them to the indignity of unfair competitions.”

“in america, this is the women’s rights issue of our time,” she added. “and the trump administration will fight relentlessly to protect them.”","['washington', 'special', 'administration', 'task', 'force', 'form', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'launch', 'investigation', 'university', 'maryland', 'wagner', 'college', 'fail', 'protect', 'female', 'athlete', 'penalize', 'refuse', 'compete', 'male', 'identify', 'female', 'daily', 'wire', 'report', 'title', 'ix', 'special', 'investigation', 'team', 'joint', 'education', 'department', 'justice', 'department', 'project', 'launch', 'direct', 'investigation', 'monday', 'university', 'maryland', 'allegation', 'allow', 'male', 'athlete', 'compete', 'woman', 'category', 'usa', 'fencing', 'tournament', 'allow', 'male', 'athlete', 'use', 'intimate', 'facility', 'special', 'investigation', 'team', 'investigate', 'wagner', 'college', 'practice', 'police', 'allegedly', 'allow', 'male', 'compete', 'female', 'sport', 'use', 'female', 'intimate', 'space', 'college', 'receive', 'letter', 'title', 'ix', 'special', 'investigation', 'team', 'monday', 'daily', 'wire', 'learn', 'read', 'letter', 'university', 'maryland', 'wagner', 'college', 'official', 'black', 'carded', 'boot', 'year', 'old', 'stephanie', 'turner', 'tournament', 'university', 'maryland', 'refuse', 'compete', 'redmond', 'sullivan', 'male', 'identify', 'woman', 'compete', 'male', 'usa', 'fencing', 'allow', 'sullivan', 'compete', 'wagner', 'college', 'compete', 'woman', 'tournament', 'organization', 'confirm', 'daily', 'wire', 'nation', 'watch', 'female', 'competitor', 'bravely', 'take', 'knee', 'forfeit', 'inherently', 'unfair', 'fencing', 'match', 'discover', 'opponent', 'male', 'education', 'department', 'spokeswoman', 'julie', 'hartman', 'tell', 'daily', 'wire', 'woman', 'recuse', 'match', 'train', 'diligently', 'fear', 'safety', 'tournament', 'host', 'university', 'maryland', 'responsibility', 'follow', 'title', 'ix', 'allow', 'male', 'compete', 'female', 'competition', 'occupy', 'female', 'intimate', 'facility', 'hartman', 'say', 'similarly', 'wagner', 'college', 'responsibility', 'allow', 'male', 'female', 'roster', 'university', 'maryland', 'responsibility', 'follow', 'title', 'ix', 'allow', 'man', 'compete', 'female', 'competition', 'woman', 'space', 'education', 'department', 'allege', 'argue', 'wagner', 'college', 'responsibility', 'protect', 'female', 'sport', 'male', 'unlike', 'biden', 'administration', 'weaponize', 'title', 'ix', 'contrary', 'meaning', 'deny', 'female', 'athlete', 'civil', 'right', 'trump', 'administration', 'department', 'education', 'department', 'justice', 'title', 'ix', 'special', 'investigation', 'team', 'allow', 'recipient', 'federal', 'funding', 'deny', 'woman', 'equal', 'opportunity', 'protection', 'law', 'hartman', 'say', 'trump', 'sign', 'keep', 'man', 'woman', 'sport', 'executive', 'order', 'photo', 'andrew', 'harnik', 'getty', 'image', 'want', 'thank', 'god', 'trust', 'mission', 'fight', 'female', 'exclusive', 'sport', 'put', 'place', 'effectively', 'protest', 'turner', 'tell', 'daily', 'wire', 'statement', 'early', 'april', 'competition', 'take', 'knee', 'forfeit', 'match', 'male', 'opponent', 'week', 'incident', 'wagner', 'college', 'confirm', 'fox', 'news', 'digital', 'male', 'athlete', 'long', 'woman', 'team', 'trump', 'administration', 'create', 'title', 'ix', 'special', 'investigation', 'team', 'receive', 'staggering', 'volume', 'title', 'ix', 'complaint', 'education', 'justice', 'department', 'vocal', 'title', 'ix', 'situation', 'california', 'maine', 'state', 'agency', 'repeatedly', 'point', 'trump', 'executive', 'order', 'protect', 'female', 'student', 'athlete', 'have', 'compete', 'have', 'appear', 'unclothed', 'male', 'trump', 'order', 'defend', 'woman', 'gender', 'ideology', 'extremism', 'biden', 'administration', 'title', 'ix', 'weaponize', 'contrary', 'meaning', 'deny', 'woman', 'equal', 'opportunity', 'protection', 'law', 'hartman', 'tell', 'daily', 'wire', 'early', 'month', 'school', 'allow', 'male', 'competitor', 'strip', 'female', 'athlete', 'rightful', 'accolade', 'threaten', 'woman', 'safety', 'subject', 'indignity', 'unfair', 'competition', 'america', 'woman', 'right', 'issue', 'time', 'add', 'trump', 'administration', 'fight', 'relentlessly', 'protect']",
603068d8-a6f8-4fd2-a88c-db83b70c9190,anti,radical transgender bill in colorado: it’s ‘coercive control’ to not affirm child’s gender identity,"['radical', 'transgender', 'bill', 'colorado', 'coercive', 'control', 'affirm', 'child', 'gender', 'identity']",daily wire,mairead elordi,https://www.dailywire.com/news/radical-transgender-bill-in-colorado-its-coercive-control-to-not-affirm-childs-gender-identity,4/3/2025,"parents in custody battles who misgender or “deadname” their child would be accused of “coercive control” under a new radical colorado bill.

the bill was introduced late friday evening and on tuesday it passed the colorado assembly’s judiciary committee in a 7-4 vote. it now heads to the assembly floor for a second reading.

the “kelly loving act,” named for a trans-identifying man who was killed in the 2022 colorado nightclub shooting, targets parents who do not affirm their child’s new gender identity.

in child custody decisions, “a court shall consider deadnaming, misgendering, or threatening to publish material related to an individual’s gender-affirming health-care services as types of coercive control,” the bill reads.

“coercive control” also includes things like threatening to kill someone or forcing someone to commit crimes under colorado law.

the bill also bars colorado courts from cooperating with other states’ laws that remove a child from their parent because the parent allowed the child to receive transgender medical services like puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones, or surgery.

the bill also says that school policies allowing children to use a different name must be “inclusive of all reasons that a student might adopt a chosen name.” also, school dress codes must not “enforce any rules based on gender,” according to the bill.

“deadnaming” and “misgendering” would officially be “discriminatory acts” under colorado law if the bill passes.

state rep. jarvis caldwell, a republican, called attention to the bill on social media and told the daily wire that democrats introduced the bill “late friday evening after we went home for the weekend.”

usually lawmakers would have at least two weeks to prepare before a bill goes to committee, but this time republicans had less than 24 hours to prepare despite democrats apparently having the bill in the works for over a year, he said.

the bill has many “serious concerns,” he said, including targeting both parents and private business owners who misgender someone.

“in my opinion, the goal is to eliminate the ability of a parent to seek treatment for gender confusion and dysphoria,” caldwell said. “i’ve seen many radical bills this legislative session, but this is by far the most egregious. at a minimum, it attacks parental rights, local control, the u.s. constitution, and more specifically, the first amendment.”

caldwell said the bill is likely to become law soon.

lori gimelshteyn, executive director of the colorado parent advocacy network called the bill an “unconstitutional overreach that turns parenting—a sacred duty to guide and protect your child—into a punishable offense if it doesn’t align with the state’s agenda.”

“this bill redefines love, conviction, and parenting as ‘coercive control’ — and that’s both dangerous and deeply wrong,” gimelshteyn told the daily wire. “what kind of society are we becoming when a parent can lose custody of their child, not for abuse, neglect or endangerment, but for using the name they gave their child at birth?”

gimelshteyn spoke in formal opposition to the bill during tuesday’s judiciary committee hearing. also speaking were two other women, mia hughes, senior researcher at genspect, and erin lee, executive director of protect kids colorado, who spoke in her personal capacity.

“there are consequences to lying to a child,” hughes told lawmakers. “a parent telling their sweet, effeminate boy who likes barbies and princess gowns that he can be a girl may solve his distress in the short term … but this is short-sighted.”

hughes explained that the data shows most children will desist and identity as their birth sex again, but this “natural process” is interrupted if a parent affirms the child’s cross-sex identity.

“it’s easy to turn a little boy into a convincing girl just by putting him in a dress and giving him a girl’s name, but the illusion becomes unsustainable when testosterone begins to surge, so now he must medicalize,” she said, citing the often permanent harms of puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones, and genital surgery.

lee said her sixth grade daughter was “secretly transitioned” at her school, convinced that her “normal pubescent discomfort” meant she was actually a transgender boy, and affirming her only caused her more mental distress.

“if this law was in place four years ago when cps came to my door for non-affirmation i would have lost my child,” she said.

“parents have long been bullied by the suicide myth: that you must transition your child or else they will kill themself. now the state is adding to that: transition your child or else we will take them from you,” lee told the daily wire. “this will harm so many fathers who are fighting their ex-spouses medicalizing their children against their will in colorado. it fortifies our status as a wrong-sex mutilation sanctuary state, encouraging more people to move here and transition their children.”

she said democrats appear to be trying to quickly pass the bill before critics can mount a response.

“democrats are seemingly trying to pass this in the night, so quickly that we don’t have time to read the bill or organize testimony against it,” she added. “but with 24 hours notice, more expert witnesses showed up to oppose than people who showed up to support this bill yesterday.”

colorado parents who oppose their children’s transgender identities have found themselves in nightmare situations.

earlier this year, one durango mother found the police would not help her retrieve her 17-year-old daughter from the house of her daughter’s former math teacher and trans-identifying husband, who had taken the girl into her home.","['parent', 'custody', 'battle', 'misgender', 'deadname', 'child', 'accuse', 'coercive', 'control', 'new', 'radical', 'colorado', 'bill', 'bill', 'introduce', 'late',

the move is due to “the staggering volume” of title ix complaints, the education department said in a friday press release announcing the “title ix special investigations team.” both the education and justice departments have been vocal about title ix situations in california and maine, as well as other states around the country. ￼

“under the biden administration, title ix was weaponized contrary to its meaning to deny women their equal opportunity protections under the law,” julie hartman, an education department spokeswoman, told the daily wire. “schools allowed male competitors to strip female athletes of their rightful accolades, threaten women’s safety, and subject them to the indignity of unfair competitions.”

hartman explained that creating the team is “an unprecedented action” through which experienced investigators and attorneys will “thoroughly investigate violations and expeditiously enforce title ix to restore women’s civil rights.” ￼

“in america, this is the women’s rights issue of our time — and the trump administration will fight relentlessly to protect them,” she said.

attorney general pam bondi on friday emphasized that protecting women and women’s sports was a “key priority” for the justice department. ￼

“this collaborative effort with the department of education will enable our attorneys to take comprehensive action when women’s sports or spaces are threatened and use the full power of the law to remedy any violation of women’s civil rights,” she said. ￼

secretary of education linda mcmahon echoed bondi’s pledge. ￼

“to all the entities that continue to allow men to compete in women’s sports and use women’s intimate facilities: there’s a new sheriff in town,” mcmahon said. “we will not allow you to get away with denying women’s civil rights any longer.” ￼

the title ix special investigations team includes the education office for civil rights investigators and attorneys, the justice department civil rights division attorneys, education’s office of general counsel attorneys, education’s student privacy and protection office case workers, and an fsa enforcement investigator. ￼

the move complements president donald trump’s executive orders on “keeping men out of women’s sports” and “defending women from gender ideology extremism.” ￼

“from day one, the trump administration has prioritized enforcing title ix to protect female students and athletes,” mcmahon said. “traditionally, our office for civil rights (ocr) takes months, even years, to complete title ix investigations. ocr under this administration has moved faster than it ever has, and the title ix sit will ensure even more rapid and consistent investigations.”","['washington', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'department', 'justice', 'education', 'create', 'joint', 'task', 'force', 'protect', 'female', 'athlete', 'pernicious', 'effect', 'gender', 'ideology', 'school', 'program', 'activity', 'staggering', 'volume', 'title', 'ix', 'complaint', 'education', 'department', 'say', 'friday', 'press', 'release', 'announce', 'title', 'ix', 'special', 'investigation', 'team', 'education', 'justice', 'department', 'vocal', 'title', 'ix', 'situation', 'california', 'maine', 'state', 'country', 'biden', 'administration', 'title', 'ix', 'weaponize', 'contrary', 'meaning', 'deny', 'woman', 'equal', 'opportunity', 'protection', 'law', 'julie', 'hartman', 'education', 'department', 'spokeswoman', 'tell', 'daily', 'wire', 'school', 'allow', 'male', 'competitor', 'strip', 'female', 'athlete', 'rightful', 'accolade', 'threaten', 'woman', 'safety', 'subject', 'indignity', 'unfair', 'competition', 'hartman', 'explain', 'create', 'team', 'unprecedented', 'action', 'experience', 'investigator', 'attorney', 'thoroughly', 'investigate', 'violation', 'expeditiously', 'enforce', 'title', 'ix', 'restore', 'woman', 'civil', 'right', 'america', 'woman', 'right', 'issue', 'time', 'trump', 'administration', 'fight', 'relentlessly', 'protect', 'say', 'attorney', 'general', 'pam', 'bondi', 'friday', 'emphasize', 'protect', 'woman', 'woman', 'sport', 'key', 'priority', 'justice', 'department', 'collaborative', 'effort', 'department', 'education', 'enable', 'attorney', 'comprehensive', 'action', 'woman', 'sport', 'space', 'threaten', 'use', 'power', 'law', 'remedy', 'violation', 'woman', 'civil', 'right', 'say', 'secretary', 'education', 'linda', 'mcmahon', 'echo', 'bondi', 'pledge', 'entity', 'continue', 'allow', 'man', 'compete', 'woman', 'sport', 'use', 'woman', 'intimate', 'facility', 'new', 'sheriff', 'town', 'mcmahon', 'say', 'allow', 'away', 'deny', 'woman', 'civil', 'right', 'long', 'title', 'ix', 'special', 'investigation', 'team', 'include', 'education', 'office', 'civil', 'right', 'investigator', 'attorney', 'justice', 'department', 'civil', 'right', 'division', 'attorney', 'education', 'office', 'general', 'counsel', 'attorney', 'education', 'student', 'privacy', 'protection', 'office', 'case', 'worker', 'fsa', 'enforcement', 'investigator', 'complement', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'executive', 'order', 'keep', 'man', 'woman', 'sport', 'defend', 'woman', 'gender', 'ideology', 'extremism', 'day', 'trump', 'administration', 'prioritize', 'enforce', 'title', 'ix', 'protect', 'female', 'student', 'athlete', 'mcmahon', 'say', 'traditionally', 'office', 'civil', 'right', 'ocr', 'take', 'month', 'year', 'complete', 'title', 'ix', 'investigation', 'ocr', 'administration', 'move', 'fast', 'title', 'ix', 'sit', 'ensure', 'rapid', 'consistent', 'investigation']",

the united states department of agriculture (usda) has paused funding to schools within the university of maine system (ums) while potential title vi and title ix violations are investigated. the pause impacts eight public colleges within ums, and a spokesperson confirmed on tuesday that the affected schools have been notified. ￼

according to the spokesperson, the email notice from the usda read in part, “this pause is temporary in nature while usda evaluates if it should take any follow-on actions related to prospective title vi or title ix violations. please take any necessary actions to effectuate this direction from leadership. this pause will remain in effect until further notice.” ￼

the spokesperson also stated that the schools impacted were not aware of any title vi or title ix violations, but was reserving judgment until “further analysis is completed.” ￼

president trump warned during a white house event in late february that he would cut funding to maine schools if the state continued to allow trans-identifying males to compete on girls’ and women’s sports teams. ￼

the following day, governor janet mills (d-me) threatened to take legal action against the trump administration if he did so — after which trump called mills out directly during a bipartisan governors working session. ￼

“is maine here? the governor of maine? are you not going to comply with it?” trump asked. ￼

“i’ll comply with state and federal law,” governor janet mills said. ￼

“we are the federal law. you better do it. because you’re not going to get any federal funding at all if you don’t,” trump warned. “and by the way, your population, even though it is somewhat liberal although i did very well there. your population doesn’t want men playing in women’s sports. you better comply because otherwise you’re not getting any federal funding.” ￼

mills pushed back, saying, “we’ll see you in court.”","['president', 'donald', 'trump', 'administration', 'make', 'good', 'threat', 'stop', 'funding', 'go', 'university', 'maine', 'amid', 'state', 'continue', 'refusal', 'comply', 'order', 'bar', 'trans', 'identify', 'male', 'compete', 'woman', 'sport', 'united', 'states', 'department', 'agriculture', 'usda', 'pause', 'funding', 'school', 'university', 'maine', 'system', 'ums', 'potential', 'title', 'vi', 'title', 'ix', 'violation', 'investigate', 'pause', 'impact', 'public', 'college', 'ums', 'spokesperson', 'confirm', 'tuesday', 'affected', 'school', 'notify', 'accord', 'spokesperson', 'email', 'notice', 'usda', 'read', 'pause', 'temporary', 'nature', 'usda', 'evaluate', 'follow', 'action', 'relate', 'prospective', 'title', 'vi', 'title', 'ix', 'violation', 'necessary', 'action', 'effectuate', 'direction', 'leadership', 'pause', 'remain', 'effect', 'notice', 'spokesperson', 'state', 'school', 'impact', 'aware', 'title', 'vi', 'title', 'ix', 'violation', 'reserve', 'judgment', 'analysis', 'complete', 'president', 'trump', 'warn', 'white', 'house', 'event', 'late', 'february', 'cut', 'funding', 'maine', 'school', 'state', 'continue', 'allow', 'trans', 'identify', 'male', 'compete', 'girl', 'woman', 'sport', 'team', 'follow', 'day', 'governor', 'janet', 'mills', 'd', 'threaten', 'legal', 'action', 'trump', 'administration', 'trump', 'call', 'mill', 'directly', 'bipartisan', 'governor', 'working', 'session', 'maine', 'governor', 'maine', 'go', 'comply', 'trump', 'ask', 'comply', 'state', 'federal', 'law', 'governor', 'janet', 'mill', 'say', 'federal', 'law', 'well', 'go', 'federal', 'funding', 'trump', 'warn', 'way', 'population', 'somewhat', 'liberal', 'population', 'want', 'man', 'play', 'woman', 'sport', 'well', 'comply', 'get', 'federal', 'funding', 'mill', 'push', 'say', 'court']",

in a letter first obtained by the daily wire, the usda warned maine, “you cannot openly violate federal law against discrimination in education and expect federal funding to continue unabated.” ￼

“your defiance of federal law has cost your state, which is bound by title ix in educational programming,” said agriculture secretary brooke rollins. “today, i am freezing maine’s federal funds for certain administrative and technological functions in schools. this is only the beginning, though you are free to end it at any time by protecting women and girls in compliance with federal law.” ￼

usda is also reviewing all research and education-related funding in maine to see if it is in compliance with the constitution, federal law including titles vi and ix, and the priorities of president donald trump’s administration, the usda said. ￼

“in order to continue to receive taxpayer dollars from usda, the state of maine must demonstrate compliance with title ix’s protection of female student athletes from having to compete with or against or having to appear unclothed before males,” rollins wrote. “usda, alongside other federal agencies, will continue to pause and, where appropriate, terminate categories of education programming in maine if these title ix violations are not resolved to the satisfaction of the federal government.” ￼

the pause will not impact federal feeding programs or direct assistance to mainers, rollins noted: “if a child was fed today, they will be fed tomorrow.” ￼

“in addition, usda has launched a full review of grants awarded by the biden administration to the maine department of education,” she said. “many of these grants appear to be wasteful, redundant, or otherwise against the priorities of the trump administration. usda will not extend the biden administration’s bloated bureaucracy and will instead focus on a department that is farmer-first and without a leftist social agenda. we look forward to the state’s cooperation with all federal reviews and future compliance with federal law and policy.”","['washington', 'united', 'states', 'department', 'agriculture', 'tell', 'maine', 'wednesday', 'freeze', 'state', 'federal', 'funding', 'maine', 'refusal', 'comply', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'executive', 'order', 'man', 'woman', 'sport', 'letter', 'obtain', 'daily', 'wire', 'usda', 'warn', 'maine', 'openly', 'violate', 'federal', 'law', 'discrimination', 'education', 'expect', 'federal', 'funding', 'continue', 'unabated', 'defiance', 'federal', 'law', 'cost', 'state', 'bind', 'title', 'ix', 'educational', 'programming', 'say', 'agriculture', 'secretary', 'brooke', 'rollin', 'today', 'freeze', 'maine', 'federal', 'fund', 'certain', 'administrative', 'technological', 'function', 'school', 'beginning', 'free', 'end', 'time', 'protect', 'woman', 'girl', 'compliance', 'federal', 'law', 'usda', 'review', 'research', 'education', 'relate', 'funding', 'maine', 'compliance', 'constitution', 'federal', 'law', 'include', 'title', 'vi', 'ix', 'priority', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'administration', 'usda', 'say', 'order', 'continue', 'receive', 'taxpayer', 'dollar', 'usda', 'state', 'maine', 'demonstrate', 'compliance', 'title', 'ix', 'protection', 'female', 'student', 'athlete', 'have', 'compete', 'have', 'appear', 'unclothed', 'male', 'rollin', 'write', 'usda', 'alongside', 'federal', 'agency', 'continue', 'pause', 'appropriate', 'terminate', 'category', 'education', 'programming', 'maine', 'title', 'ix', 'violation', 'resolve', 'satisfaction', 'federal', 'government', 'pause', 'impact', 'federal', 'feeding', 'program', 'direct', 'assistance', 'mainer', 'rollin', 'note', 'child', 'feed', 'today', 'feed', 'tomorrow', 'addition', 'usda', 'launch', 'review', 'grant', 'award', 'biden', 'administration', 'maine', 'department', 'education', 'say', 'grant', 'appear', 'wasteful', 'redundant', 'priority', 'trump', 'administration', 'usda', 'extend', 'biden', 'administration', 'bloated', 'bureaucracy', 'instead', 'focus', 'department', 'farmer', 'leftist', 'social', 'agenda', 'look', 'forward', 'state', 'cooperation', 'federal', 'review', 'future', 'compliance', 'federal', 'law', 'policy']",

trump has already signed executive orders to cut off federal funding for schools that push gender-ideology on children and end any funding for institutions that promote transgender procedures on children. ￼

“i also signed an order to cut off all taxpayer funding to any institution that engages in the sexual mutilation of our youth,” trump said. “and now i want congress to pass a bill permanently banning and criminalizing sex changes on children and forever ending the lie that any child is trapped in the wrong body.” ￼

“and our message to every child in america is that you are perfect exactly the way god made you,” he added. ￼

trump’s executive order from earlier this year said that the government would not fund, sponsor, promote, assist, or support the attempted gender transition of a child, promising that it will “rigorously enforce all laws that prohibit or limit these destructive and life-altering procedures.” ￼

over two dozen republican-led states have passed laws to ban transgender procedures, such as cutting off the breasts of girls who identify as boys and giving cross-sex hormones to children of both sexes. ￼

republicans, like senators roger marshall of kansas and josh hawley of missouri, have previously proposed legislation that would crack down on transgender procedures on kids nationwide. ￼

hawley introduced a measure in january that would allow children harmed by transgender procedures to sue the doctors and hospitals that carried out the operations. ￼

hawley’s bill would enable individuals to sue the pediatric gender clinics and doctors who gave them cross-sex hormones or performed transgender surgery on them as minors. the legislation comes after president donald trump signed an executive order blocking federal funding for any hospital that performs such procedures. ￼

“our children should no longer suffer from irreversible and dangerous child mutilation procedures, which the biden administration enabled and promoted,” hawley said. “i welcome president trump’s strong action to reverse this child abuse and look forward to working with his administration to advance legislation that protects our kids.”","['president', 'donald', 'trump', 'call', 'congress', 'pass', 'federal', 'ban', 'criminalize', 'perform', 'transgender', 'procedure', 'child', 'joint', 'address', 'tuesday', 'night', 'trump', 'sign', 'executive', 'order', 'cut', 'federal', 'funding', 'school', 'push', 'gender', 'ideology', 'child', 'end', 'funding', 'institution', 'promote', 'transgender', 'procedure', 'child', 'sign', 'order', 'cut', 'taxpayer', 'funding', 'institution', 'engage', 'sexual', 'mutilation', 'youth', 'trump', 'say', 'want', 'congress', 'pass', 'bill', 'permanently', 'ban', 'criminalize', 'sex', 'change', 'child', 'forever', 'end', 'lie', 'child', 'trap', 'wrong', 'body', 'message', 'child', 'america', 'perfect', 'exactly', 'way', 'god', 'add', 'trump', 'executive', 'order', 'early', 'year', 'say', 'government', 'fund', 'sponsor', 'promote', 'assist', 'support', 'attempt', 'gender', 'transition', 'child', 'promise', 'rigorously', 'enforce', 'law', 'prohibit', 'limit', 'destructive', 'life', 'alter', 'procedure', 'dozen', 'republican', 'lead', 'state', 'pass', 'law', 'ban', 'transgender', 'procedure', 'cut', 'breast', 'girl', 'identify', 'boy', 'give', 'cross', 'sex', 'hormone', 'child', 'sex', 'republican', 'like', 'senator', 'roger', 'marshall', 'kansas', 'josh', 'hawley', 'missouri', 'previously', 'propose', 'legislation', 'crack', 'transgender', 'procedure', 'kid', 'nationwide', 'hawley', 'introduce', 'measure', 'january', 'allow', 'child', 'harm', 'transgender', 'procedure', 'sue', 'doctor', 'hospital', 'carry', 'operation', 'hawley', 'bill', 'enable', 'individual', 'sue', 'pediatric', 'gender', 'clinic', 'doctor', 'give', 'cross', 'sex', 'hormone', 'perform', 'transgender', 'surgery', 'minor', 'legislation', 'come', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'sign', 'executive', 'order', 'block', 'federal', 'funding', 'hospital', 'perform', 'procedure', 'child', 'long', 'suffer', 'irreversible', 'dangerous', 'child', 'mutilation', 'procedure', 'biden', 'administration', 'enable', 'promote', 'hawley', 'say', 'welcome', 'president', 'trump', 'strong', 'action', 'reverse', 'child', 'abuse', 'look', 'forward', 'work', 'administration', 'advance', 'legislation', 'protect', 'kid']",

u.s. district judge ana reyes, who in the past worked to defeat california proposition 209, which wanted to ban state governmental institutions from considering race, sex, or ethnicity regarding employment, claimed in her 79-page opinion that military leaders were “responsible for integrating transgender persons into open military service,” and asserted that recruiting, unit cohesion, and military readiness had improved since 2021.

on january 27, president trump issued executive order 14183, which revoked biden’s executive order 14004, which permitted transgenders to serve openly in the military. trump’s order stated:

… the armed forces have been afflicted with radical gender ideology to appease activists unconcerned with the requirements of military service like physical and mental health, selflessness, and unit cohesion. longstanding department of defense (dod) policy (dod instruction (dodi) 6130.03) provides that it is the policy of the dod to ensure that service members are “[f]ree of medical conditions or physical defects that may reasonably be expected to require excessive time lost from duty for necessary treatment or hospitalization.”

“consistent with the military mission and longstanding dod policy, expressing a false ‘gender identity’ divergent from an individual’s sex cannot satisfy the rigorous standards necessary for military service,” the order continued. “beyond the hormonal and surgical medical interventions involved, adoption of a gender identity inconsistent with an individual’s sex conflicts with a soldier’s commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one’s personal life. a man’s assertion that he is a woman, and his requirement that others honor this falsehood, is not consistent with the humility and selflessness required of a service member.” ￼

on february 26, defense secretary hegseth issued a memo whose policy stated, “military service by service members and applicants for military service who have a current diagnosis or history of, or exhibit symptoms consistent with, gender dysphoria is incompatible with military service.” ￼

reyes claimed the trump administration “rushed” their policy into action, comparing it to previous policies that allowed transgenders into the military. “the law does not demand that the court rubber-stamp illogical judgments based on conjecture,” she argued. ￼

she also accused the transgender ban of having “animus.” reyes wrote, “the court could stop here in its analysis and comfortably conclude that plaintiffs are likely to succeed on their claim that the military ban is motivated by animus and is not tailored to meet its stated goals.”","['tuesday', 'district', 'judge', 'ana', 'reyes', 'nominate', 'post', 'president', 'biden', 'issue', 'preliminary', 'injunction', 'block', 'trump', 'administration', 'ban', 'transgender', 'troop', 'serve', 'military', 'district', 'judge', 'ana', 'reyes', 'past', 'work', 'defeat', 'california', 'proposition', 'want', 'ban', 'state', 'governmental', 'institution', 'consider', 'race', 'sex', 'ethnicity', 'employment', 'claim', 'page', 'opinion', 'military', 'leader', 'responsible', 'integrate', 'transgender', 'person', 'open', 'military', 'service', 'assert', 'recruiting', 'unit', 'cohesion', 'military', 'readiness', 'improve', 'january', 'president', 'trump', 'issue', 'executive', 'order', 'revoke', 'biden', 'executive', 'order', 'permit', 'transgender', 'serve', 'openly', 'military', 'trump', 'order', 'state', 'armed', 'force', 'afflict', 'radical', 'gender', 'ideology', 'appease', 'activist', 'unconcerned', 'requirement', 'military', 'service', 'like', 'physical', 'mental', 'health', 'selflessness', 'unit', 'cohesion', 'longstanding', 'department', 'defense', 'dod', 'policy', 'dod', 'instruction', 'dodi', 'provide', 'policy', 'dod', 'ensure', 'service', 'member', 'medical', 'condition', 'physical', 'defect', 'reasonably', 'expect', 'require', 'excessive', 'time', 'lose', 'duty', 'necessary', 'treatment', 'hospitalization', 'consistent', 'military', 'mission', 'longstanding', 'dod', 'policy', 'express', 'false', 'gender', 'identity', 'divergent', 'individual', 'sex', 'satisfy', 'rigorous', 'standard', 'necessary', 'military', 'service', 'order', 'continue', 'hormonal', 'surgical', 'medical', 'intervention', 'involve', 'adoption', 'gender', 'identity', 'inconsistent', 'individual', 'sex', 'conflict', 'soldier', 'commitment', 'honorable', 'truthful', 'discipline', 'lifestyle', 'personal', 'life', 'man', 'assertion', 'woman', 'requirement', 'honor', 'falsehood', 'consistent', 'humility', 'selflessness', 'require', 'service', 'member', 'february', 'defense', 'secretary', 'hegseth', 'issue', 'memo', 'policy', 'state', 'military', 'service', 'service', 'member', 'applicant', 'military', 'service', 'current', 'diagnosis', 'history', 'exhibit', 'symptom', 'consistent', 'gender', 'dysphoria', 'incompatible', 'military', 'service', 'reyes', 'claim', 'trump', 'administration', 'rush', 'policy', 'action', 'compare', 'previous', 'policy', 'allow', 'transgender', 'military', 'law', 'demand', 'court', 'rubber', 'stamp', 'illogical', 'judgment', 'base', 'conjecture', 'argue', 'accuse', 'transgender', 'ban', 'have', 'animus', 'reye', 'write', 'court', 'stop', 'analysis', 'comfortably', 'conclude', 'plaintiff', 'likely', 'succeed', 'claim', 'military', 'ban', 'motivate', 'animus', 'tailor', 'meet', 'stated', 'goal']",

marshall’s bill would “establish clear and consistent biological definitions of male and female,” according to a copy of the bill shared with the daily wire. the bill is in line with trump’s day one executive order that made it official government policy to only recognize two sexes grounded in biological reality. ￼

“the democrats’ radical transgender agenda is dangerous and wrong. we shouldn’t need legislation to tell us the basic reality that there are only two sexes, but here we are,” marshall told the daily wire. “i’m thankful president trump has made this a top priority and signed an executive order on his first day in office recognizing that there are only two sexes. congress must ensure this historic action is written into law by passing the defining male and female act.” ￼

the bill defines “male” as a “person belonging, at conception, to the biological sex characterized by a reproductive system with the biological function of producing sperm” and female as a “person belonging, at conception, to the sex characterized by a reproductive system with the biological function of producing eggs (ova).” ￼

a man is then defined as an “adult human male” and a woman as an “adult human female.” ￼

marshall’s legislation would also make clear that the term “gender identity” is not a proper replacement for sex. ￼

“‘gender identity’ means an identity that reflects an internal and subjective sense of self, disconnected from biological reality and sex and existing on an indeterminate continuum, and, because such an identity does not provide a meaningful basis for identification for purposes of federal law, the term shall not be recognized by the federal government as a replacement for sex,” the legislation says. ￼

illinois gop rep. mary miller is also expected to introduce a companion measure in the house. ￼

“now more than ever, we must unite to uphold the truth and biological reality established by god that there are only two sexes,” she told the daily wire. “i am proud to stand alongside senator marshall in introducing the house companion to the defining male and female act to ensure our nation upholds common sense and puts an end to the left’s dangerous and extreme sexual fantasies.” ￼

marshall introduced a similar bill in november, before republicans had taken control of the senate. ￼

in his january executive order, trump rooted his definitions of male and females in biology. ￼

“it is the policy of the united states to recognize two sexes, male and female. these sexes are not changeable and are grounded in fundamental and incontrovertible reality,” the executive order said. “when administering or enforcing sex-based distinctions, every agency and all federal employees acting in an official capacity on behalf of their agency shall use the term ‘sex’ and not ‘gender’ in all applicable federal policies and documents.” ￼

trump later took action to ban funding for entities that promote transgender procedures on kids. in december, marshall put forth a bill that would ban doctors from performing the procedures on kids nation-wide.","['kansas', 'senator', 'roger', 'marshall', 'introduce', 'bill', 'wednesday', 'codify', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'executive', 'order', 'define', 'male', 'female', 'biological', 'term', 'marshall', 'bill', 'establish', 'clear', 'consistent', 'biological', 'definition', 'male', 'female', 'accord', 'copy', 'bill', 'share', 'daily', 'wire', 'bill', 'line', 'trump', 'day', 'executive', 'order', 'official', 'government', 'policy', 'recognize', 'sex', 'ground', 'biological', 'reality', 'democrats', 'radical', 'transgender', 'agenda', 'dangerous', 'wrong', 'need', 'legislation', 'tell', 'basic', 'reality', 'sex', 'marshall', 'tell', 'daily', 'wire', 'thankful', 'president', 'trump', 'priority', 'sign', 'executive', 'order', 'day', 'office', 'recognize', 'sex', 'congress', 'ensure', 'historic', 'action', 'write', 'law', 'pass', 'define', 'male', 'female', 'act', 'bill', 'define', 'male', 'person', 'belong', 'conception', 'biological', 'sex', 'characterize', 'reproductive', 'system', 'biological', 'function', 'produce', 'sperm', 'female', 'person', 'belong', 'conception', 'sex', 'characterize', 'reproductive', 'system', 'biological', 'function', 'produce', 'egg', 'ova', 'man', 'define', 'adult', 'human', 'male', 'woman', 'adult', 'human', 'female', 'marshall', 'legislation', 'clear', 'term', 'gender', 'identity', 'proper', 'replacement', 'sex', 'gender', 'identity', 'mean', 'identity', 'reflect', 'internal', 'subjective', 'sense', 'self', 'disconnect', 'biological', 'reality', 'sex', 'exist', 'indeterminate', 'continuum', 'identity', 'provide', 'meaningful', 'basis', 'identification', 'purpose', 'federal', 'law', 'term', 'shall', 'recognize', 'federal', 'government', 'replacement', 'sex', 'legislation', 'say', 'illinois', 'gop', 'rep', 'mary', 'miller', 'expect', 'introduce', 'companion', 'measure', 'house', 'unite', 'uphold', 'truth', 'biological', 'reality', 'establish', 'god', 'sex', 'tell', 'daily', 'wire', 'proud', 'stand', 'alongside', 'senator', 'marshall', 'introduce', 'house', 'companion', 'defining', 'male', 'female', 'act', 'ensure', 'nation', 'uphold', 'common', 'sense', 'put', 'end', 'left', 'dangerous', 'extreme', 'sexual', 'fantasy', 'marshall', 'introduce', 'similar', 'bill', 'november', 'republicans', 'take', 'control', 'senate', 'january', 'executive', 'order', 'trump', 'root', 'definition', 'male', 'female', 'biology', 'policy', 'united', 'states', 'recognize', 'sex', 'male', 'female', 'sex', 'changeable', 'ground', 'fundamental', 'incontrovertible', 'reality', 'executive', 'order', 'say', 'administer', 'enforce', 'sex', 'base', 'distinction', 'agency', 'federal', 'employee', 'act', 'official', 'capacity', 'behalf', 'agency', 'shall', 'use', 'term', 'sex', 'gender', 'applicable', 'federal', 'policy', 'document', 'trump', 'later', 'take', 'action', 'ban', 'funding', 'entity', 'promote', 'transgender', 'procedure', 'kid', 'december', 'marshall', 'forth', 'bill', 'ban', 'doctor', 'perform', 'procedure', 'kid', 'nation', 'wide']",
1ccfc218-4f64-469d-ab19-fb583e6f651e,anti,exclusive: trump immigration agency halts biden era gender policy ‘effective immediately’,"['exclusive', 'trump', 'immigration', 'agency', 'halts', 'biden', 'era', 'gender', 'policy', 'effective', 'immediately']",daily wire,mary margaret olohan,https://www.dailywire.com/news/exclusive-u-s-citizenship-and-immigration-services-will-only-recognize-two-genders,4/2/2025,"washington—the agency that oversees all immigration services in the united states is officially ending the biden era practice of offering a third gender option on immigration forms, updating its policy guidance to clarify that it only recognizes two sexes: male and female, the daily wire can first report.

the u.s. citizenship and immigration services (uscis) has historically required that requesters choose between male or female on its forms, documents obtained by the daily wire show. but in april 2024 under president joe biden’s administration, uscis added another option, a gender identity marker of “x.”

that is no longer the case, uscis shared wednesday, consistent with president donald trump’s executive order on “defending women from gender ideology extremism and restoring biological truth to the federal government.” ￼

“effective immediately,” uscis is revoking the policy and “now returning to its historical policy of recognizing two sexes to ensure that the information uscis collects in this category provides a meaningful and useful basis for identification,” a document shared with the daily wire reads. ￼

“an applicant’s sex, like their date of birth, is part of their identity and uscis uses identity to create secure documents, as well as for screening and vetting. uscis also shares identity-based data with other agencies of the u.s. government, and data fields such as sex must follow standards for such data sharing to function properly,” the document explains.

the decision will impact a variety of key documents that the uscis handles, including green cards, employment authorization documents, certificates of naturalization, and more, a dhs official shared.

“there are only two sexes — male and female,” assistant secretary tricia mclaughlin told the daily wire on wednesday morning.

“president trump promised the american people a revolution of common sense, and that includes making sure that the policy of the u.s. government agrees with simple biological reality,” she said. “proper management of our immigration system is a matter of national security, not a place to promote and coddle an ideology that permanently harms children and robs real women of their dignity, safety, and well-being.”

under the new guidance, uscis considers a person’s sex to be the sex listed on their birth certificate issued at the time of their birth or near the time of their birth. if a requestor’s stated sex conflicts with the sex on their birth certificate, uscis will consider the birth certificate to be the deciding factor.

the new guidance also replaces the term “gender” with “sex” throughout the uscis policy manual and removes language from the appendix about gender identity.","['washington', 'agency', 'oversee', 'immigration', 'service', 'united', 'states', 'officially', 'end', 'biden', 'era', 'practice', 'offer', 'gender', 'option', 'immigration', 'form', 'update', 'policy', 'guidance', 'clarify', 'recognize', 'sex', 'male', 'female', 'daily', 'wire', 'report', 'citizenship', 'immigration', 'service', 'uscis', 'historically', 'require', 'requester', 'choose', 'male', 'female', 'form', 'document', 'obtain', 'daily', 'wire', 'april', 'president', 'joe', 'biden', 'administration', 'uscis', 'add', 'option', 'gender', 'identity', 'marker', 'long', 'case', 'uscis', 'share', 'wednesday', 'consistent', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'executive', 'order', 'defend', 'woman', 'gender', 'ideology', 'extremism', 'restore', 'biological', 'truth', 'federal', 'government', 'effective', 'immediately', 'uscis', 'revoke', 'policy', 'return', 'historical', 'policy', 'recognize', 'sex', 'ensure', 'information', 'uscis', 'collect', 'category', 'provide', 'meaningful', 'useful', 'basis', 'identification', 'document', 'share', 'daily', 'wire', 'read', 'applicant', 'sex', 'like', 'date', 'birth', 'identity', 'uscis', 'use', 'identity', 'create', 'secure', 'document', 'screening', 'vetting', 'uscis', 'share', 'identity', 'base', 'datum', 'agency', 'government', 'data', 'field', 'sex', 'follow', 'standard', 'datum', 'sharing', 'function', 'properly', 'document', 'explain', 'decision', 'impact', 'variety', 'key', 'document', 'uscis', 'handle', 'include', 'green', 'card', 'employment', 'authorization', 'document', 'certificate', 'naturalization', 'dhs', 'official', 'share', 'sex', 'male', 'female', 'assistant', 'secretary', 'tricia', 'mclaughlin', 'tell', 'daily', 'wire', 'wednesday', 'morning', 'president', 'trump', 'promise', 'american', 'people', 'revolution', 'common', 'sense', 'include', 'make', 'sure', 'policy', 'government', 'agree', 'simple', 'biological', 'reality', 'say', 'proper', 'management', 'immigration', 'system', 'matter', 'national', 'security', 'place', 'promote', 'coddle', 'ideology', 'permanently', 'harm', 'child', 'rob', 'real', 'woman', 'dignity', 'safety', 'new', 'guidance', 'uscis', 'consider', 'person', 'sex', 'sex', 'list', 'birth', 'certificate', 'issue', 'time', 'birth', 'near', 'time', 'birth', 'requestor', 'state', 'sex', 'conflict', 'sex', 'birth', 'certificate', 'uscis', 'consider', 'birth', 'certificate', 'decide', 'factor', 'new', 'guidance', 'replace', 'term', 'gender', 'sex', 'uscis', 'policy', 'manual', 'remove', 'language', 'appendix', 'gender', 'identity']",
2bfe92d3-c318-40e0-a333-99b84bceef65,pro,trans student’s arrest for violating florida bathroom law is thought to be a first,"['trans', 'student', 'arrest', 'violate', 'florida', 'bathroom', 'law', 'think']",nbc,the associated press,https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-news/trans-students-arrest-violating-florida-bathroom-law-thought-first-rcna199697,4/3/2025,"a transgender college student declared “i am here to break the law” before entering a women’s restroom at the florida state capitol and being led out in handcuffs by police. civil rights attorneys say the arrest of marcy rheintgen last month is the first they know of for violating transgender bathroom restrictions passed by numerous state legislatures across the country.

capitol police had been alerted and were waiting for rheintgen, 20, when she entered the building in tallahassee march 19. they told her she would receive a trespass warning once she entered the women’s restroom to wash her hands and pray the rosary, but she was later placed under arrest when she refused to leave, according to an arrest affidavit.

rheintgen faces a misdemeanor trespassing charge punishable by up to 60 days in jail and is due to appear in court in may.

“i wanted people to see the absurdity of this law in practice,” rheintgen told the associated press. “if i’m a criminal, it’s going to be so hard for me to live a normal life, all because i washed my hands. like, that’s so insane.”

at least 14 states have adopted laws barring transgender women from entering women’s bathrooms at public schools and, in some cases, other government buildings. only two — florida and utah — criminalize the act. a judge on wednesday temporarily blocked montana’s new bathroom law.

rheintgen’s arrest in florida is the first that american civil liberties union attorneys are aware of in any state with a criminal ban, senior staff attorney jon davidson said.

rheintgen was in town visiting her grandparents when she decided to pen a letter to each of florida’s 160 state lawmakers informing them of her plan to enter a public restroom inconsistent with her sex assigned at birth. the illinois resident said her act of civil disobedience was fueled by anger at seeing a place she loves and visits regularly grow hostile toward trans people.

trump kept his promise to order a ban on trans female athletes. court fights have followed.
“i know that you know in your heart that this law is wrong and unjust,” she wrote in her letter to lawmakers. “i know that you know in your heart that transgender people are human too, and that you can’t arrest us away. i know that you know that i have dignity. that’s why i know that you won’t arrest me.”

her arrest comes as many republican-led states that have enacted restroom restrictions grapple with how to enforce them. laws in alabama, kansas, kentucky and north dakota do not spell out any enforcement mechanism, and even the state laws that do largely rely on private individuals to report violations.

in utah, activists flooded a tip line created to alert state officials to possible violations of its bathroom law with thousands of hoax reports in an effort to shield transgender residents and their allies from any legitimate complaints that could lead to an investigation.

the republican sponsors of the florida bathroom law, rep. rachel plakon and sen. erin grall, did not immediately respond thursday to phone messages, emails and visits to their offices to seek comment on rheintgen’s arrest. they have said the restrictions are needed to protect women and girls in single-sex spaces.

opponents of the law such as nadine smith, executive director of the lgbtq+ advocacy group equality florida, said it creates dangerous situations for all by giving people license to police others’ bodies in bathrooms.

“the arrest of marcy rheintgen is not about safety,” smith said. “it’s about cruelty, humiliation and the deliberate erosion of human dignity. transgender people have been using restrooms aligned with their gender for generations without incident. what’s changed is not their presence — it’s a wave of laws designed to intimidate them out of public life.”

if rheintgen is convicted, she worries she could be jailed with men, forced to cut her long hair and prevented temporarily from taking gender-affirming hormones.

“people are telling me it’s a legal test, like this is the first case that’s being brought,” she said. “it’s how they test the law. but i didn’t do this to test the law. i did it because i was upset. i can’t have any expectations for what’s going to happen because this has never been prosecuted before. i’m horrified and scared.”","['transgender', 'college', 'student', 'declare', 'break', 'law', 'enter', 'woman', 'restroom', 'florida', 'state', 'capitol', 'lead', 'handcuff', 'police', 'civil', 'right', 'attorney', 'arrest', 'marcy', 'rheintgen', 'month', 'know', 'violate', 'transgender', 'bathroom', 'restriction', 'pass', 'numerous', 'state', 'legislature', 'country', 'capitol', 'police', 'alert', 'wait', 'rheintgen', 'enter', 'building', 'tallahassee', 'march', 'tell', 'receive', 'trespass', 'warning', 'enter', 'woman', 'restroom', 'wash', 'hand', 'pray', 'rosary', 'later', 'place', 'arrest', 'refuse', 'leave', 'accord', 'arrest', 'affidavit', 'rheintgen', 'face', 'misdemeanor', 'trespassing', 'charge', 'punishable', 'day', 'jail', 'appear', 'court', 'want', 'people', 'absurdity', 'law', 'practice', 'rheintgen', 'tell', 'associated', 'press', 'criminal', 'go', 'hard', 'live', 'normal', 'life', 'wash', 'hand', 'like', 'insane', 'state', 'adopt', 'law', 'bar', 'transgender', 'woman', 'enter', 'woman', 'bathroom', 'public', 'school', 'case', 'government', 'building', 'florida', 'utah', 'criminalize', 'act', 'judge', 'wednesday', 'temporarily', 'block', 'montana', 'new', 'bathroom', 'law', 'rheintgen', 'arrest', 'florida', 'american', 'civil', 'libertie', 'union', 'attorney', 'aware', 'state', 'criminal', 'ban', 'senior', 'staff', 'attorney', 'jon', 'davidson', 'say', 'rheintgen', 'town', 'visit', 'grandparent', 'decide', 'pen', 'letter', 'florida', 'state', 'lawmaker', 'inform', 'plan', 'enter', 'public', 'restroom', 'inconsistent', 'sex', 'assign', 'birth', 'illinois', 'resident', 'say', 'act', 'civil', 'disobedience', 'fuel', 'anger', 'see', 'place', 'love', 'visit', 'regularly', 'grow', 'hostile', 'trans', 'people', 'trump', 'keep', 'promise', 'order', 'ban', 'trans', 'female', 'athlete', 'court', 'fight', 'follow', 'know', 'know', 'heart', 'law', 'wrong', 'unjust', 'write', 'letter', 'lawmaker', 'know', 'know', 'heart', 'transgender', 'people', 'human', 'arrest', 'away', 'know', 'know', 'dignity', 'know', 'will', 'arrest', 'arrest', 'come', 'republican', 'lead', 'state', 'enact', 'restroom', 'restriction', 'grapple', 'enforce', 'law', 'alabama', 'kansas', 'kentucky', 'north', 'dakota', 'spell', 'enforcement', 'mechanism', 'state', 'law', 'largely', 'rely', 'private', 'individual', 'report', 'violation', 'utah', 'activist', 'flood', 'tip', 'line', 'create', 'alert', 'state', 'official', 'possible', 'violation', 'bathroom', 'law', 'thousand', 'hoax', 'report', 'effort', 'shield', 'transgender', 'resident', 'ally', 'legitimate', 'complaint', 'lead', 'investigation', 'republican', 'sponsor', 'florida', 'bathroom', 'law', 'rep', 'rachel', 'plakon', 'sen', 'erin', 'grall', 'immediately', 'respond', 'thursday', 'phone', 'message', 'email', 'visit', 'office', 'seek', 'comment', 'rheintgen', 'arrest', 'say', 'restriction', 'need', 'protect', 'woman', 'girl', 'single', 'sex', 'space', 'opponent', 'law', 'nadine', 'smith', 'executive', 'director', 'advocacy', 'group', 'equality', 'florida', 'say', 'create', 'dangerous', 'situation', 'give', 'people', 'license', 'police', 'body', 'bathroom', 'arrest', 'marcy', 'rheintgen', 'safety', 'smith', 'say', 'cruelty', 'humiliation', 'deliberate', 'erosion', 'human', 'dignity', 'transgender', 'people', 'restroom', 'align', 'gender', 'generation', 'incident', 'change', 'presence', 'wave', 'law', 'design', 'intimidate', 'public', 'life', 'rheintgen', 'convict', 'worry', 'jail', 'man', 'force', 'cut', 'long', 'hair', 'prevent', 'temporarily', 'take', 'gender', 'affirm', 'hormone', 'people', 'tell', 'legal', 'test', 'like', 'case', 'bring', 'say', 'test', 'law', 'test', 'law', 'upset', 'expectation', 'go', 'happen', 'prosecute', 'horrified', 'scared']",
35c32474-5956-4c2c-ae80-06e27e4dcfbd,pro,"trans woman arrested, sent to men’s jail for entering florida capitol bathroom","['trans', 'woman', 'arrest', 'send', 'man', 'jail', 'enter', 'florida', 'capitol', 'bathroom']",erin in the morning,s. baum,https://www.erininthemorning.com/p/trans-woman-arrested-sent-to-mens,4/1/2025,"when 20-year-old college student marcy rheintgen made her yearly spring break trip to her grandparents’ property in florida, she said she felt at peace — until march 19, when police escorted her out of the bathroom of the state capitol building and placed her in handcuffs. evidently, rheintgen had violated a 2023 state law criminalizing trans people who use government-owned public restrooms that align with their gender.

tampa bay times reporter romy ellenbogen accompanied rheintgen to the capitol. when they arrived, several officers were stationed outside the women’s restroom doors. they warned her not to enter the women’s restroom. draped in a white, frilly dress and a pink bow, rheintgen went in anyway and washed her hands.

that’s when police entered the restroom and told rheintgen she was being detained. a devout catholic, she had wanted to take a moment to pray the rosary, but she never got the chance.

after spending less than 60 seconds in the women’s restroom, rheintgen said, she was charged with trespassing with a warning.

meanwhile, her rosary was confiscated as an officer from the florida department of law enforcement handcuffed and detained rheintgen, searched her person and her vehicle, and then shuttled her to the leon county detention facility, where she stayed overnight in the men’s ward. if convicted, she could spend up to 60 days incarcerated.

the fdle did not respond to a request for comment.

about a week before her trek, she sent about a hundred and sixty print letters to florida lawmakers announcing she would engage in the time-honored practice of civil disobedience: she would use the women’s restroom at the florida state capitol. she named her date and time.

“i know that as a transgender woman, this means i will probably be arrested. i am violating laws because i personally believe it to be wrong.

“i’m not a political activist,” she told erin in the morning. “i’m just a normal college student who thinks this law is wrong.”

the letters included a photo of herself so that officials could identify her. “i understand i could go to jail for up to sixty days in a men’s prison, where if the statistics are true, i would likely be raped.”

she writes that going to jail would “uproot her life,” but this was a risk she was willing to take:

“i understand that if you're receiving this letter, you're part of the florida bicameral legislature, which means you're probably one of the people who wrote this law or voted for it. i know that you know in your heart that this law is wrong and unjust. i know that you know in your heart that it's wrong to arrest me and jail me for sixty days for simply using the bathroom. i know that you know in your heart that transgender people are human too, and that you can't arrest us away. i know that you know in your heart that transgender people are no different from you or anybody else. i know that you know in your heart that the same people that go to church with you, eat in the same restaurants, go to the same schools, root for the same sports teams, watch the same movies and pray to the same god as you cannot be all bad. i know that you know that i have dignity. that's why i know that you won't arrest me.”

signing off, she added: “pray for me.”

“i’m a really religious person,” she told erin in the morning. she’s a devout catholic who describes herself as a political centrist, with an appreciation for “family values” but a soft spot for dorothy day, the prolific catholic leftwing activist.

a police affidavit she shared with erin in the morning — with her deadname (blurred out below), and the wrong pronouns listed — otherwise corroborates most all of her story.

rheintgen’s telling is also corroborated by reports from the tampa bay times journalist who accompanied rheintgen to the bathroom.

“i actually wanted to move to florida when i was older, growing up, but i don't know if i can do that now, "" she said. she fondly remembers her favorite beaches and bologna sandwiches with her grandparents. but now, it seems, her “home away from home” isn’t safe for her.

“i don’t want attention. i just want people to see this law and how crazy it is to put people like us in jail. i was so terrified,” she said. she admits she hadn’t consulted legal or advocacy organizations before the endeavor; she didn’t know what to expect. “they were treating me like i murdered someone — but i just used the wrong bathroom.”

rheintgen said she was motivated to act after seeing the anti-trans legislation surge throughout the united states, and when she read about hunter schafer, the euphoria actress, who was issued a “male” passport despite being a woman. “she’s a personal hero of mine,” rheintgen said. the fear and the vitriol she saw play out over the news cycle brought her to a breaking point.

while bills like bathroom bans and drag bans have been sweeping the country in recent years, the criminalization of gender diverse people is by no means new. black and brown trans women, especially, have been routinely criminalized for decades under the guise of “solicitation” or “loitering” ordinances, even in a so-called liberal stronghold like new york. the phenomenon is so pervasive that it has been dubbed the “walking while trans ban.”

jon harris maurer, public policy director of equality florida, emphasized that the bathroom bans are just the latest attempt by the state’s gop to eradicate trans people from public life. “these are hard working, tax paying individuals who are our family, neighbors, and colleagues,” he told erin in the morning. “weaponizing bathroom access in a place like the state capitol is an antidemocratic effort to block them from directly participating in government while simultaneously stripping their rights behind closed doors.”","['year', 'old', 'college', 'student', 'marcy', 'rheintgen', 'yearly',

today’s sweeping and extreme policy changes represent a wholesale abandonment of the norms and best practices of content moderation. the new language of meta’s community standards includes numerous changes that will result in instagram, facebook, and threads becoming unsafe landscapes filled with dangerous hate speech, violence, harassment, and misinformation. 

glaad president and ceo sarah kate ellis today responded to meta’s rollback:

“zuckerberg’s removal of fact-checking programs and industry-standard hate speech policies make meta’s platforms unsafe places for users and advertisers alike. without these necessary hate speech and other policies, meta is giving the green light for people to target lgbtq people, women, immigrants, and other marginalized groups with violence, vitriol, and dehumanizing narratives. with these changes, meta is continuing to normalize anti-lgbtq hatred for profit — at the expense of its users and true freedom of expression. fact-checking and hate speech policies protect free speech.” 

today’s announcement includes numerous alarming changes (many entirely overturning meta’s previous policies) to both allow anti-lgbtq hateful rhetoric, and cease to protect lgbtq users from being targeted with such attacks. notably, the additions of the words “transgenderism” (a hateful right wing neologism intended to imply that being trans is an ideology) and “homosexuality” (an outdated and pathologizing way of referring to lgbtq people) are shocking red flags. 

stating that, “our policies are designed to allow room for these types of speech,” meta’s new policies now expressly allow such anti-lgbtq speech as: “insulting language in the context of discussing political or religious topics, such as when discussing transgender rights, immigration, or homosexuality” and “allegations of mental illness or abnormality when based on gender or sexual orientation, given political and religious discourse about transgenderism [sic] and homosexuality…’” meta has also removed clauses prohibiting the following: “the usage of slurs that are used to attack people on the basis of their protected characteristics” and “self-admission to intolerance on the basis of protected characteristics, including but not limited to: homophobic, islamophobic, racist.”

these are just a few of the many extreme new policies the company has adopted. these sweeping policy changes will harm not only the historically marginalized groups who have been stripped of protections — but all platform users who will be confronted with unmoderated, extremist rhetoric and hate.

the changes coincide with meta ceo mark zuckerberg’s announcement that the company is ending its fact-checking program, and replacing it with a “community notes”-style system. the company also stated that meta will move its us-based content review team to texas. in december, zuckerberg said he seeks an “active role” in shaping tech policy in the upcoming trump administration.

below are just some of the changes made to meta’s hateful conduct policies today: 

allowances for attacks on lgbtq people, women, and immigrants: specifically, meta now states: “people sometimes use sex- or gender-exclusive language when discussing access to spaces often limited by sex or gender, such as access to bathrooms, specific schools, specific military, law enforcement, or teaching roles, and health or support groups. other times, they call for exclusion or use insulting language in the context of discussing political or religious topics, such as when discussing transgender rights, immigration, or homosexuality. finally, sometimes people curse at a gender in the context of a romantic break-up. our policies are designed to allow room for these types of speech.”
allowances for economic exclusion of women and transgender people: in its economic exclusion clause, meta now states “we do allow content arguing for gender-based limitations of military, law enforcement, and teaching jobs. we also allow the same content based on sexual orientation, when the content is based on religious beliefs.”
allowances for social exclusion of women and transgender people: meta states that it now allows for content advocating for “sex or gender-based exclusion from spaces commonly limited by sex or gender, such as restrooms, sports and sports leagues, health and support groups, and specific schools.”
allowances for claims that lgbtq people are mentally ill: meta now states “we do allow allegations of mental illness or abnormality when based on gender or sexual orientation, given political and religious discourse about transgenderism [sic] and homosexuality and common non-serious usage of words like ‘weird.’” please see an explanation of “transgenderism,” a rightwing neologism that is commonly used as an anti-trans dogwhistle.
removal of prohibitions against dehumanization of protected groups — previously, meta prohibited “dehumanizing speech in the form of comparisons to or generalizations about:
inanimate objects: for example, “women as household objects or property or objects in general … transgender or non-binary people as “it.”
criminals: for example, “thieves,” “bank robbers,” or saying “all [protected characteristic or quasi-protected characteristic] are ‘criminals.”
removal of prohibition against statements denying existence — for example,  “[protected characteristic(s) or quasi-protected characteristic] do not exist” or “[protected characteristic(s) or quasi-protected characteristic] shouldn’t exist.”
reducing clarity on hate speech: meta removes prohibitions on “statements of inferiority, expressions of contempt or disgust; cursing; and calls for exclusion or segregation.”
reducing clarity on meta’s definition of slurs: previously, meta defined slurs as speech “used to attack people on the basis of their protected characteristics.”
reducing clarity on “generalizations that state inferiority” and “contempt,” which meta now calls “insults”: meta has now removed several sections of its policy that previously prohibited harassment regarding physical appearance, mental characteristics, and other statements of protected groups being “worthless” or “freaks.”
meta has removed several definitions of “contempt,” including “intolerance on the basis of protected characteristics, including but not limited to: homophobic, islamophobic, racist.”
other changes to meta’s hate speech policy include:

transitioning from the phrase “hate speech” to “hateful conduct”
removal of meta’s previous acknowledgment that hate speech “creates an environment of intimidation and exclusion, and in some cases may promote offline violence.”
removals of additional restrictions for paid content
the current version of meta’s policies is here, and previous versions showing what has been changed can be found on the left-hand tabs. meta first started its efforts to combat hate speech in the 2010s, adding improvements over the last decade. meta formalized its hate speech policy in 2018, clarifying definitions of hate speech including attacks based on race, ethnicity, national origin, religious affiliation, sexual orientation, caste, sex, gender identity, and disability.

as highlighted in glaad’s 2024 social media safety index (smsi) report, meta’s facebook, threads, and instagram are largely failing to mitigate dangerous anti-lgbtq hate and disinformation. the june 2024 smsi — in which meta received a failing score for the fourth year — also recommends that meta and other companies better train moderators on the needs of lgbtq users.

meta’s enforcement failures have elicited longtime concern from the oversight board, trust and safety experts, human rights advocates, advertisers, and even meta’s shareholders.","['january', 'glaad',

there is no evidence of escalating violence committed by lgbtq people. extremism and domestic terrorism experts tell politifact that there are no widespread threats of growing radicalization or violence from the transgender population.
accusing people from a small and vulnerable community of mass shooting crimes is an effort to further dehumanize, demonize, and promote fear about transgender and nonbinary people. 
despite being less than 2% of the u.s. adult population, transgender people are four times as likely to be victims of crime. glaad’s alert desk has tracked more than 2,100 anti-lgbtq incidents from june 2022 – december 2024, including 750+ incidents specifically targeting transgender and nonbinary people.
baseless claims about a suspect’s gender identity circulate while there’s national attention on the event, but before there are confirmed key details. when evidence is released showing the suspect was cisgender, inaccurate posts about the suspect’s transgender identity often remain up and continue spreading unverified, dangerous tropes.
far-right extremism is increasing and surpasses terrorism committed by others, politifact reports. these groups tend to engage in violence that often targets lgbtq people, and promotes anti-lgbtq views.
a 2023 reuters fact check confirms that mass shootings, for example, are overwhelmingly carried out by cisgender men in the u.s.
terms to avoid:

“trans terrorism” – there is no evidence that one’s transgender or nonbinary identity fuels extremist attacks or leads to violence.

transgender people make up a tiny fraction of all athletes. ncaa president charlie baker testified in december 2024 that he knows of fewer than ten transgender college student-athletes among 510,000 athletes total.
all players follow protocols to participate. international olympic committee guidelines for transgender inclusion say there should be “no presumed advantage” based on sex assigned at birth or sex characteristics. ioc guidelines were created in consultation with experts in sports, medicine, and human rights.
sports bans are part of a systematic and expanding targeting of transgender people and youth that has surged to include their medically-necessary and supported health care, book bans and curriculum bans, and access to the restroom.
research shows states that include transgender participation have more girls participating in sports than states with bans. claims that trans inclusion harms girls’ sports are inaccurate and baseless.
women and girls face significant barriers in sports that have nothing to do with transgender inclusion: inequitable facilities, pay, and marketing; abusive coaches; and racist, sexist, and homophobic harassment. ask critics of transgender inclusion what efforts they have made to resolve real issues harming women and girls in sports.
a 2024 ncaa study shows female players receive a barrage of social media harassment. 80% of abusive posts were directed at march madness athletes, with female basketball players receiving about three times more abusive messages than their male counterparts.
the 2024 ncaa women’s basketball and wnba seasons and championships saw their highest ratings women’s sports are not suffering because trans people might be included.
sports bans endanger all female players by encouraging baseless, false allegations and discriminatory, invasive screening. a college volleyball team in california had to get security to protect teams when one player was accused of being transgender. a high school player in utah falsely accused of being transgender had to get police protection and a utah elected official was censured for sharing disinformation about her. bans on trans athletes have led to invasive screening that violate the privacy and safety of all women and girls, and discourages more who might want to play. athletes of all ages and abilities who are not trans have been bullied and harassed when accused of being trans.
sex verification testing, which is being pushed by opponents of transgender people who say bans on sports participation are not enough, could cost schools and leagues anywhere from $1,000 to $15,000+ per athlete. opponents have not explained where funding for these invasive tests would come from.
lgbtq athletes continue to face challenges based on their identities. while lgbtq acceptance in sports has advanced in recent years, racism, sexism, transphobia, homophobia, biphobia, and colonialism are ongoing barriers for lgbtq athletes from multiple marginalized identities. harmful policies, attitudes, and discourse about lgbtq people in sports are directed at transgender people, people with intersex traits, people of color, people from non-western countries, women who do not fit conventional norms around femininity, as well as men who do not fit outdated norms of masculinity.
athletes come in all shapes and sizes including physical advantages helpful to their sports, such as michael phelps’ long arms and simone biles’ compact size that help them excel, yet those physical attributes have never been used to restrict or ban their participation. being an athlete is also more than bodies – it is about courage, dedication, luck, talent, and most urgently, expanding access and encouragement for all who want to play.
seek transgender voices in stories about transgender people.
challenge lawmakers proposing bills to provide evidence for any claims about athlete safety and privacy.
include lawmakers’ history of activating against women and lgbtq equality (marriage, adoption, book bans, workplace discrimination, and efforts to restrict reproductive health care that have proven deadly for female patients nationwide.) claims about “keeping women and girls safe” should be contrasted with a record that explicitly endangers them.
seek expert opinion. south carolina gamecocks coach dawn staley said in 2024 that transgender women are women and all women should be able to play sports if they want to. the championship coach, who knows the game best and has nurtured and inspired hundreds of players, believes transgender women should be able to play. listen to women who are in the game, who understand the real challenges their players face, and have worked to make more athletes feel welcome.
challenge paid spokespeople for evidence that blanket bans improve participation and fairness. seek and include athletes who support transgender inclusion, not just those with time and monetized incentive to target transgender people.
cdc research shows that transgender youth face disproportionate bullying, distress and increased risk of self-harm from being socially ostracized and excluded at school. 40% of transgender and questioning students have experienced bullying at school. 25% of transgender students and 26% of questioning students skipped school because they felt unsafe, compared with 8.5% of cisgender male students.
the cdc urged schools to “create safer and more supportive environments for transgender and questioning students” with inclusive activities, mental health and other health service referrals, and implementing policies that are lgbtq-inclusive. “having supportive families and peers, feeling connected to family and school, having affirmed name and pronouns used consistently by others, and having a sense of pride of identity are protective factors for transgender students that buffer the effects of minority stressors and promote better mental health.”
include the benefits of sports for all children and their peers, and how trans youth would be unfairly and harmfully excluded from these experiences and lessons. sports offer multitudes of benefits, including being active and healthy, making friends, feeling a sense of belonging and purpose, learning how to be gracious competitors as well as winners and losers, learning how to cooperate as a team, learning how to emotionally regulate, learning new skills, learning how to set and achieve goals. sports participation is proven to improve academic performance, boost social and emotional wellbeing, and build skills and relationships that help youth succeed in all facets of life.","['journalist', 'cover', 'legislation', 'transgend', 'participation', 'sport', 'include', 'fact',

8a4a409b-fdcf-4898-9eab-5c3ec623698b,pro,fact sheet: term to avoid – “transgenderism”,"['fact', 'sheet', 'term', 'avoid', 'transgenderism']",glaad,none listed,https://glaad.org/term-to-avoid-transgenderism/,1/10/2025,"“transgenderism” is a term appropriated by opponents of transgender equality to inaccurately and harmfully imply that being trans is a political ideology, rather than an authentic aspect of one’s personhood. 
framing a person’s transgender identity as a “concept” or “ideology” reduces a core identity to an opinion that can be debated, and therefore justifies dehumanization, discrimination, and real-world violence against transgender, nonbinary, and gender nonconforming people. 
“transgenderism” and similar terms like “gender ideology” have been weaponized since the mid-1990s by the international anti-gender movement and again in the 2010s with the rise of the uk-based trans-exclusionary radical feminism (terfism) movement.
in 2023, the use of “transgenderism” expanded in american right-wing circles following a speech by an anti-lgbtq commentator at the 2023 conservative political action conference (cpac), where he stated: “for the good of society … transgenderism must be eradicated from public life entirely.”
in 2025, as part of its larger rollbacks on lgbtq user safety, meta updated its hate speech policy to employ the term “transgenderism.”
today, anti-lgbtq politicians, media pundits, and other online accounts use “transgenderism” and similar, coded anti-trans language to undermine the rights of transgender people and protections for their safety. the term is also a tactic to evade some social media platforms’ hate speech and harassment policies as users claim it is opposition to a belief system, rather than targeting trans people themselves.
the term’s academic and intra-community origins are explained here.
terms to avoid: 

“transgenderism” – trans identities are not a political ideology. they are core to one’s sense of self, in the same way as one’s age, race, and ethnicity.

response from glaad’s social media safety program:
“with these changes, meta and mark zuckerberg are now not only permitting and encouraging, but engaging in anti-lgbtq hate speech — by intentionally employing anti-lgbtq language (“transgenderism”) in the company’s own hate speech policy and instituting new policies permitting extreme anti-lgbtq slurs (“tr*nny”),” said a glaad spokesperson. “this is a complete break with best practices in content moderation and squarely moves the company into the territory of truth social and other extreme right-wing platforms that are unsafe for youth and advertisers. platforms that encourage anti-lgbtq hate and violence and other strains of general extremist rhetoric.”

glaad president and ceo sarah kate ellis today responded to the latest developments:
“meta’s sweeping, hate-driven corporate policy and product changes this week are shocking and dangerous. the company’s litany of dangerous actions is unprecedented. in one week, they have dismantled an entire history of brand-safety best practices, consumer trust, and most importantly, user safety. these changes will harm users and make meta’s platforms unsafe for everyone. meta is now an anti-lgbtq company.”

as reported by several media outlets, many of these changes originated from new meta global policy chief joel kaplan. these moves follow meta ceo mark zuckerberg’s statements and actions, including zuckerberg’s $1m donation to the incoming administration, seeking an active role in the trump administration, and mischaracterizing these egregious company changes as a stance against “censorship” following trump’s election in 2016.

on tuesday, glaad responded after meta removed and adapted several sections of its hateful conduct policy, rolling back safety guardrails for lgbtq people, people of color, women, immigrants, and other protected groups. these changes are in addition to news this week that meta will end its fact-checking program. read glaad’s full analysis here.

timeline of meta’s anti-lgbtq actions this week:

on friday, axios reported that meta is terminating its diversity, equity, and inclusion (dei) programs. meanwhile, zuckerberg appeared on right-wing commentator joe rogan’s show announcing the widespread changes, and promoting the disproven narrative that conservative accounts are unfairly “censored.”
on friday, the new york times reported that there will no longer be any meta teams devoted to dei, goals for hiring women and minorities, nor a diversity preference for working with outside, minority-owned supplier businesses.
on friday, 404 media reported that meta deleted trans and nonbinary themes on messenger.
on thursday, the intercept and platformer leaked excerpts from new training materials for now-allowable content, which include dehumanizing attacks on lgbtq people and many other marginalized groups. in the materials, meta states that “tr*nny” is no longer a designated slur and is now non-violating. when used in a derogatory way, “tr*nny” is an extreme slur for a trans person. note: meta spelled out this slur in its communications. see glaad’s fact sheet, which explains why this word is a slur and why we recommend media not repeat it without an asterisk.
examples in the training materials for content moderators include: “trans people are mentally ill,” “a trans person isn’t a he or she, it’s an it,” and “get these tr*nnies out of my school (beneath a photo of high school students).” note: in this example, meta also did not modify the slur with an asterisk.
on thursday, 404 media reported that, among lgbtq and ally employees, the changes have “sparked widespread backlash at the company.”
on tuesday, meta announced that it is ending its fact-checking program, and the company removed and adapted major sections of its hateful conduct policy
the updated policy now allows “allegations of mental illness or abnormality when based on gender or sexual orientation, given political and religious discourse about transgenderism [sic] and homosexuality [sic].” note: “transgenderism” a right wing neologism intended to imply that being trans is an ideology, and “homosexuality” is an outdated and pathologizing way of referring to lgbtq people. meta has not previously used these terms in public policies or communications.
in recent weeks, meta made several executive personnel changes, including installing joel kaplan as global policy chief, dustin carmack (former project 2025 and ron desantis staffer) as director of public policy, and ufc head dana white on its board of directors.
the new language of meta’s community standards includes numerous changes that will result in instagram, facebook, and threads becoming unsafe landscapes filled with dangerous hate speech, violence, harassment, and misinformation. this week, platformer spoke to 10 current of former employees, who said that the changes would likely lead to substantial increases in hate speech.

experts in trust and safety and extremism are increasingly examining the connections between online hate and real-world violence. glaad’s alert desk has tracked more than 2,100 anti-lgbtq incidents from june 2022 – december 2024, including 750+ incidents specifically targeting transgender and non-binary people.

as highlighted in glaad’s 2024 social media safety index (smsi) report, meta’s facebook, threads, and instagram are largely failing to mitigate dangerous anti-lgbtq hate and disinformation. in august 2024, glaad and media matters for america found 100 meta posts with the anti-trans slur “tr*nny.” even after the content was escalated to meta’s team, the company chose to not remove the majority of the posts (even though the posts objectively violated its policies). in march 2024, glaad released a report that found meta is largely failing to moderate extreme content targeting trans people.","['january', 'glaad', 'world', 'large', 'lesbian', 'gay', 'bisexual', 'transgender', 'queer', 'lgbtq', 'medium', 'advocacy', 'organization', 'respond', 'meta', 'unprecedented', 'set',

cfc51d60-5d5f-4caa-aff0-41c8dad66eed,pro,"glaad, transgender service advocates respond to discriminatory executive order regarding transgender people in the military","['glaad', 'transgender', 'service', 'advocate', 'respond', 'discriminatory', 'executive', 'order', 'transgender', 'people', 'military']",glaad,none listed,https://glaad.org/releases/glaad-transgender-service-advocates-respond-to-discriminatory-executive-order-regarding-transgender-people-in-the-military/,1/28/2025,"(january 28, 2025 — new york, ny) — today glaad, the world’s leading lgbtq media advocacy organization, as well as advocates for transgender u.s. service members, are responding to president trump’s latest anti-lgbtq disinformation regarding transgender people and transgender americans serving in the military.

the facts are:

the order is not a “ban,” it is a directive to the defense secretary to implement discrimination into the military. the order includes inaccurate and inflammatory language about americans who capably and honorably serve their country, and have for years, with zero negative impact on military readiness or effectiveness.
the order gives the defense secretary 60 days to complete this task. the defense secretary has a vast record of mismanagement, personal misconduct, and violent and inaccurate statements against women and female service members, including allegations of sexual assault.
there is no evidence to support the trump administration’s claims.
there is no evidence that gender identity has a negative impact on capacity to serve. 
there is research to show trump’s previous ban on trans service had a negative impact on military readiness, unit cohesion, and national security.
56 generals, admirals, and other leaders from every service branch condemned trump’s previous attempt to bar open service, noting it would “degrade readiness even more than the failed ‘don’t ask, don’t tell’ policy.”
trump’s executive order discriminates and spreads disinformation about an entire group of americans. it is also in conflict with trump’s discriminatory diversity, equity, and inclusion rollbacks which say it is illegal to discriminate based on sex. trump’s orders are lawless and incoherent.
majorities of the american public and military personnel have long supported open transgender military service.
at least 30 countries allow open service for transgender military personnel, including the uk and israel.
health care for transgender people is supported by every major medical association. many of the same treatments are also safely prescribed to cisgender people to affirm their gender. there is no evidence to support trump claims that trans health care negatively impacts ability to serve.
donald trump never served in the military and deferred himself from service multiple times based on fraudulent medical claims. trump’s record of targeting lgbtq people is documented on the trump accountability tracker. 
glaad’s president and ceo sarah kate ellis (she/her) issued the following statement:
“transgender people are already serving in the military with honor and keeping our country and military safer and stronger. they meet the same rigorous health and readiness standards, and continue to do so. the trump administration’s inaccurate statements and rhetoric targeting transgender people are not based on facts. lgbtq americans have been here before, ending ‘don’t ask, don’t tell’ and trump’s previous trans military ban. research and military experts have made it loud and clear that targeting service members because of who they are is blatantly discriminatory and makes our country less safe.”

sparta pride:
“transgender americans have served openly and honorably in the u.s. armed forces for nearly a decade. thousands of transgender troops are currently serving, and are fully qualified for the positions in which they serve. transgender service members currently fill critical roles in combat arms, aviation, nuclear engineering, law enforcement, and military intelligence, many requiring years of specialized training and expertise. transgender troops have deployed to combat zones, served in high-stakes missions, and demonstrated their ability to strengthen unit cohesion and morale.”

alaina kupec (she/her), a transgender veteran, former us naval intelligence officer, grace founder and president:
“across the world today, countless transgender service members are defending our nation’s freedom, at the very same time their freedom is being taken away from them. these sailors, marines, airmen and soldiers serve our country with the utmost honor, and many have served long successful careers. prohibiting transgender individuals from service undermines our nation’s values and readiness at the very moment our military is needed. whether they serve in the red sea, the asia-pacific region, or here close to home, they serve so that so many americans do not have to. this policy eschews our nation’s values of liberty and justice for all. this distraction aids our nation’s enemies by destabilizing our fighting forces. those in command of transgender service members are now left to wonder how their staffing gaps will be filled. and transgender service members are now worried about their futures instead of focusing on doing their job defending our nation.”

rep. leigh finke (she/her), the first out transgender member of the minnesota house of representatives, responded on cnn:
“these are glorified press releases meant to scare people and to create uncertainty, meant to push people towards discrimination of transgender people and will be very difficult to enforce, and will take upwards of a year to figure out if this is even going to be possible. in the meantime it’s going to expose trans folks and make our lives more difficult.”

other advocates doing important work to support lgbtq service members include modern military association of america, which provides a united voice for lgbtq+ military and veteran communities and works to uphold and expand the civil rights progress made on behalf of lgbtq+ service members, veterans, and their families.

additional background:

as with most of pres. trump’s executive orders, the public and the media should exercise great caution and skepticism regarding their accuracy, legality, next steps and implementation:

legal groups are already planning to sue trump, again. lambda legal: “seven years ago we were able to successfully block the earlier administration’s effort. not only is such a move cruel, it compromises the safety and security of our country and is particularly dangerous and wrong. as we promised then, so do we now: we will sue. once again, as during the first term, the trump administration is attacking a vulnerable population based on bias, political opportunism and demonstrably untrue ‘alternative facts,’ denying brave men and women the opportunity to serve our country without any legitimate justification whatsoever.”
legal experts have noted that trump’s orders are written sloppily and hastily, and are likely illegal and/or unconstitutional or not legally binding. last thursday, federal district judge john c. coughenour – a reagan appointee – blocked trump’s attempt to restrict birthright citizenship, calling it “blatantly unconstitutional.”
executive orders cannot override the u.s. constitution, federal statutes, or established legal precedent.
donald trump never served in the military, deferred himself from being drafted multiple times on dubious grounds, has disparaged military personnel including generals he hired in his last administration, and used the sacred ground of arlington cemetery to campaign for office. this is not a credible source on what is best for the military.
pete hegseth was confirmed as secretary of defense by a single tie-breaking vote. three republican senators voted against him because he lacks qualifications and character. hegseth’s history of financial mismanagement, lack of knowledge about basic military facts, and personal misconduct and sexual assault allegations and payoffs should be included in any claims the trump administration and spokespeople make about “meritocracy,” “integrity,” or “honesty” in the military.","['january', 'new', 'york', 'ny', 'today', 'glaad', 'world', 'lead', 'lgbtq', 'medium', 'advocacy', 'organization',

9bc81f8f-54db-4e89-9877-55571027fa13,pro,chris mosier: “trans athletes play sports for the same reasons as anybody else. for our love of the game.”,"['chris', 'mosier', 'trans', 'athlete', 'play', 'sport', 'reason', 'anybody', 'love', 'game']",glaad,none listed,https://glaad.org/chris-mosier-trans-athletes-play-sports-for-the-same-reasons-as-anybody-else-for-our-love-of-the-game/,2/6/2025,"chris mosier is an out transgender athlete, and a trailblazer, and he’s speaking out about president donald trump’s executive order that seeks to ban transgender athletes from competing in women’s and girl’s school-sponsored sports.

mosier told cnn, “sports has just been the entry point to other areas of discrimination against our community, including health care access, safety in schools, removing things from school curriculum about transgender people, and so on.”

mosier is the first transgender athlete to represent the united states in international competition, first transgender athlete in the espn body issue, and first transgender athlete sponsored by nike. he’s also the first transgender athlete to qualify for the olympic trials in the gender they identify.

“there’s no evidence that trans athletes have an advantage over anyone else in sports,” mosier continued. “trans athletes play sports for the same reasons as anybody else. for our love of the game, to be a part of a team, to challenge ourselves, and most of all, at the youth level, to have fun. and every young person deserves that opportunity to be their authentic self and to play the sports they love without compromising any part of who they are.”

like many of the trump executive orders, there are inherent contradictions and inconsistencies. the executive order gives instructions to the department of education, which president trump has already strongly hinted he wants to close, and that legally must happen through a law passed in congress. it threatens to defund education institutions that permit transgender athletes to participate in sports. the order falsely claims that including trans participation is a violation of title ix, the federal legislation that prohibits sex-based discrimination in educational settings. in essence, it is encouraging discrimination by weaponizing protections against discrimination to target transgender people. 

ncaa president charlie baker testified in december that he knew of “less than 10” transgender collegiate athletes out of 510,000 total. he did not specify how many of those athletes are transgender women, who are specifically targeted by the order. the ncaa announced on feb. 6, the day after trump signed the nonbinding executive order, that its board of governors voted to update the association’s participation policy for transgender student-athletes. the new policy limits competition in women’s sports to student-athletes assigned female at birth only.
the decision was made without consulting the ncaa’s board of medical experts that has advised the ncaa for years on safety and fairness. dr. jack turban announced he is resigning from the ncaa committee on competitive safeguards and medical aspects of sports, stating: “it is clear that your decision was based on politics and not science, as the csmas was not consulted prior to the decision.”

there is no evidence of a need for this new policy, or the need to immediately implement it. instruction from the department of education to educational institutions that would guide the policy and its enforcement will likely take months and then will be subject to legal scrutiny.

the administration currently has no secretary of education, and its nominee, has yet to answer questions about her role in accusations of enabling sexual assault and exploitation of children. 

transgender people have been playing sports for decades. the ncaa and international olympic committee (ioc) have developed scientifically-based guidelines to ensure fairness and inclusion for at least a decade. and research shows states that include transgender participation have more girls participating in sports than states with bans.

sports bans are part of a systematic and expanding targeting of transgender people and youth that has surged to include their medically-necessary and supported health care, book bans and curriculum bans, and access to the restroom. this ban follows executive orders that challenges the right of out trans people to serve in the military, and the right of transgender people to receive health care. 

“so we can see that this is a part of a larger picture,” mosier said. “and the talking point of trying to ban trans women and girls from girls and women’s sports has just been so incredibly divisive that it’s been what they’ve latched onto to kick off discrimination against our community.”

journalist and activist for transgender rights raquel willis spoke to abc news about the ban: “this has never really been about trans women and girls in sports. this has always been about trying to erase us from society, from access to health care, employment, education, safety and security. we are not going to let this happen. trans folks and the folks who love us and support us and understand our brilliance are rising up.”

willis continued, “i want us to see the connections around all of the attacks, the attacks on our immigrant family, our undocumented immigrant family, that is part and parcel of the attacks on transgender people. the attacks on our passports—right now we’re not able to change our gender to have our true identity reflected there, that is a document and security that ties us to the fights against immigrants right now. the attacks on dei—if you have an administration who says you don’t exist, how are you going to get a job? we need a culture of deeper empathy.”

glaad also responded to the proposed ban: “this administration’s latest inaccurate and incoherent piece of paper smears an entire group of americans but does not change the law or the facts. all women and girls, including transgender women and girls, should be welcome to play sports if they want, make decisions about their own bodies, be hired for jobs they are qualified for, and be free from lawless attacks by extremists in elected office.”

many of trump’s executive orders have been blocked in court as unconstitutional and illegal. multiple orders are being challenged in court.

advocates for trans equality (a4te) notes that: “for adolescents, any medical transition care such as hormone therapy or puberty blockers are only prescribed based on an individual young person’s needs. any surgical care for teenagers under 18 is rare and individualized.” research shows access to puberty blockers during adolescence is associated with a significant decrease in suicidal ideation. doctors have used these medications safely for decades for cisgender children who experience precocious puberty. 
opponents of transgender rights, including anti-equality politicians and right-wing media figures, often use inflammatory mischaracterizations of transgender health care to baselessly raise fear and dehumanize transgender people. it is increasingly common to see these figures intentionally employing false, incendiary terms such as: “mutilation,” “castration,” and “sterilization.” a february 2025 poynter fact check notes that these are “claims that clash with leading medical research and practice.”
additional false terms and conspiracy theories include baselessly asserting that being transgender is an ideology (“transgenderism,” “gender ideology”) or contagious (“rapid onset gender dysphoria” or “rogd”) which has never been proven to be happening or accurate, or the result of indoctrination (“transing,” “groomer”- made up terms that weaponize and undermine understanding of actual child abuse). 
the media should not report or repeat these intentionally false framings of transgender health care and transgender people. if inflammatory rhetoric is being employed by newsmakers, journalists should explain that the use of these terms is not accurate, has no scientific basis, are used to dehumanize lgbtq people by opponents of lgbtq equality, and are examples of intentional misinformation about evidence-based health care that is supported by every major medical association (30+ statements here).
when spokespeople make misleading claims about transgender health care, journalists should challenge them to provide evidence to back up their claims, or not report them at all. include fact checks in reporting, and interview trans and nonbinary people and include them in coverage regarding trans healthcare.
explaining the impact of malicious mischaracterizations of transgender healthcare, the 2024 glaad social media safety index notes that: “the sensationalized word choice in these tropes is designed to elicit a strong reaction from parents and guardians of young kids — and also potentially inspires violence against healthcare providers who are characterized as perpetrating this perceived harm.”
glaad’s alert desk has tracked nearly 200 anti-lgbtq incidents (196) since june 2022 which specifically target health care providers and their patients. these include 85 protests, 29 hateful propaganda campaigns, and six bomb threats.
after one such attack, dr. izzy lowell told glaad: “our office was burnt to the ground by arsonists in late 2023, followed by the texas attorney general’s unlawful attempt to access our patient data. we refused to comply, and will not ever disclose hipaa-protected data. we at queermed will never stop providing affirming medical care for transgender and nonbinary people, despite physical attacks and unfounded government threats.”","['transition', 'relate', 'health', 'care', 'transgender', 'people', 'include', 'youth', 'support', 'major', 'medical', 'association', 'lead', 'health', 'authority', 'effort', 'ban', 'criminalize', 'care', 'base', 'medical', 'scientific', 'expertise', 'frequently', 'employ', 'intentional', 'misinformation', 'health', 'care', 'trans', 'nonbinary', 'gender', 'non', 'conforming', 'people', 'encompass', 'advocate', 'trans', 'equality', 'note', 'adolescent', 'medical', 'transition', 'care', 'hormone', 'therapy', 'puberty', 'blocker', 'prescribe', 'base', 'individual', 'young', 'person', 'need', 'surgical', 'care', 'teenager', 'rare', 'individualized', 'research', 'show', 'access', 'puberty', 'blocker', 'adolescence', 'associate', 'significant', 'decrease', 'suicidal', 'ideation', 'doctor', 'medication', 'safely', 'decade', 'cisgender', 'child', 'experience', 'precocious', 'puberty', 'opponent', 'transgender', 'right', 'include', 'anti', 'equality', 'politician', 'right', 'wing', 'medium', 'figure', 'use', 'inflammatory', 'mischaracterization', 'transgender', 'health', 'care', 'baselessly', 'raise', 'fear', 'dehumanize', 'transgender', 'people', 'increasingly', 'common', 'figure', 'intentionally', 'employ', 'false', 'incendiary', 'term', 'mutilation', 'castration', 'sterilization', 'february', 'poynter', 'fact', 'check', 'note', 'claim', 'clash', 'lead', 'medical', 'research', 'practice', 'additional', 'false', 'term', 'conspiracy', 'theory', 'include', 'baselessly', 'assert', 'transgender', 'ideology', 'transgenderism', 'gender', 'ideology', 'contagious', 'rapid', 'onset', 'gender', 'dysphoria', 'rogd', 'prove', 'happen', 'accurate', 'result', 'indoctrination', 'transing', 'term', 'weaponize', 'undermine', 'understanding', 'actual', 'child', 'abuse', 'medium', 'report', 'repeat', 'intentionally', 'false', 'framing', 'transgender', 'health', 'care', 'transgender', 'people', 'inflammatory', 'rhetoric', 'employ', 'newsmaker', 'journalist', 'explain', 'use', 'term', 'accurate', 'scientific', 'basis', 'dehumanize', 'lgbtq', 'people', 'opponent', 'lgbtq', 'equality', 'example', 'intentional', 'misinformation', 'evidence', 'base', 'health', 'care', 'support', 'major', 'medical', 'association', 'statement', 'spokespeople', 'misleading', 'claim', 'transgender', 'health', 'care', 'journalist', 'challenge', 'provide', 'evidence', 'claim', 'report', 'include', 'fact', 'check', 'reporting', 'interview', 'tran', 'nonbinary', 'people', 'include', 'coverage', 'trans', 'healthcare', 'explain', 'impact', 'malicious', 'mischaracterization', 'transgender', 'healthcare', 'glaad', 'social', 'medium', 'safety', 'index', 'note', 'sensationalized', 'word', 'choice', 'trope', 'design', 'elicit', 'strong', 'reaction', 'parent', 'guardian', 'young', 'kid', 'potentially', 'inspire', 'violence', 'healthcare', 'provider', 'characterize', 'perpetrate', 'perceive', 'harm', 'glaad', 'alert', 'desk', 'track', 'nearly', 'anti', 'lgbtq', 'incident', 'june', 'specifically', 'target', 'health', 'care', 'provider', 'patient', 'include', 'protest', 'hateful', 'propaganda', 'campaign', 'bomb', 'threat', 'attack', 'dr', 'izzy', 'lowell', 'tell', 'glaad', 'office', 'burn', 'ground', 'arsonist', 'late', 'follow', 'texas', 'attorney', 'general', 'unlawful', 'attempt', 'access', 'patient', 'datum', 'refuse', 'comply', 'disclose', 'hipaa', 'protect', 'datum', 'queermed', 'stop', 'provide', 'affirm', 'medical', 'care', 'transgender', 'nonbinary', 'people', 'despite', 'physical', 'attack', 'unfounded', 'government', 'threat']",

“the decision to change “lgbtq” to “lgb” on the stonewall national monument page is yet another example of the trump administration’s blatant attempts to discriminate against and erase the legacies of transgender and queer americans. the stonewall uprising – a monumental moment in the fight for lgbtq rights – would not have happened without the leadership of transgender and gender non-conforming people. the tireless work of marsha p. johnson, sylvia rivera, and countless other trans women of color paved the way and continue to inspire us. you can try to erase our history, but we will never forget those who came before us and we will continue to fight for all those who will come after us.”

statement from the stonewall inn gives back initiative and the stonewall inn

“the stonewall inn and the stonewall inn gives back initiative are outraged and appalled by the recent removal of the word ‘transgender’ from the stonewall national monument page on the national park service website. this blatant act of erasure not only distorts the truth of our history, but it also dishonors the immense contributions of transgender individuals — especially transgender women of color — who were at the forefront of the stonewall riots and the broader fight for lgbtq+ rights.

let us be clear: stonewall is transgender history. marsha p. johnson, sylvia rivera, and countless other trans and gender-nonconforming individuals fought bravely, and often at great personal risk, to push back against oppressive systems. their courage, sacrifice, and leadership were central to the resistance we now celebrate as the foundation of the modern lgbtq+ rights movement.

this decision to erase the word ‘transgender’ is a deliberate attempt to erase our history and marginalize the very people who paved the way for many victories we have achieved as a community. it is a direct attack on transgender people, especially transgender women of color, who continue to face violence, discrimination, and erasure at every turn.

we demand the immediate restoration of the word ‘transgender’ on the stonewall national monument website. we will not stand by while the legacies of our transgender siblings are erased from the history books. the stonewall inn and the stonewall inn gives back initiative stands unwaveringly in solidarity with the transgender community and all who fight for full equality, and we will not rest until this grave injustice is corrected.”

“the stonewall inn and the stonewall inn gives back initiative are outraged and appalled by the recent removal of the word ‘transgender’ from the stonewall national monument page on the national park service website. this blatant act of erasure not only distorts the truth of our history, but it also dishonors the immense contributions of transgender individuals — especially transgender women of color — who were at the forefront of the stonewall riots and the broader fight for lgbtq+ rights. 

“let us be clear: stonewall is transgender history. marsha p. johnson, sylvia rivera, and countless other trans and gender-nonconforming individuals fought bravely, and often at great personal risk, to push back against oppressive systems. their courage, sacrifice, and leadership were central to the resistance we now celebrate as the foundation of the modern lgbtq+ rights movement.

“this decision to erase the word ‘transgender’ is a deliberate attempt to erase our history and marginalize the very people who paved the way for many victories we have achieved as a community. it is a direct attack on transgender people, especially transgender women of color, who continue to face violence, discrimination, and erasure at every turn.

“we demand the immediate restoration of the word ‘transgender’ on the stonewall national monument website. we will not stand by while the legacies of our transgender siblings are erased from the history books. the stonewall inn and the stonewall inn gives back initiative stands unwaveringly in solidarity with the transgender community and all who fight for full equality, and we will not rest until this grave injustice is corrected.”

statement from the stonewall national monument visitors center, an independent and queer owned non-profit venue located across the street from the stonewall national monument – owned by pride live and unaffiliated with the monument or national park service – slamming the change to the agency’s website:

“pride live is a non-profit organization founded on the principle of advancing the fight for full lgbtqia+ equality. through the creation of the stonewall national monument visitor center, we’re unwavering in our effort to protect and preserve stonewall’s legacy and history. our space is inextricably linked with and honors the brave pioneers, especially transgender and gender-nonconforming individuals, who led the stonewall rebellion. 

“independently owned and operated, and 100% supported by donations, we will continue our mission to ensure that every person has access to learn about and see themselves in history.”

statement from a glaad spokesperson: “the decision to change “lgbtq+” to “lgb” on the stonewall national monument page is yet another example of the trump administration’s blatant attempts to discriminate against and erase the legacies of transgender and queer americans. the stonewall uprising – a monumental moment in the fight for lgbtq+ rights – would not have happened without the leadership of transgender and gender non-conforming people. the tireless work of marsha p. johnson, sylvia rivera, and countless other trans women of color paved the way and continue to inspire us. you can try to erase our history, but we will never forget those who came before us and we will continue to fight for all those who will come after us.”

additional background for reporters:

the stonewall inn bar is the site of the 1969 riots that launched the lgbtq+ rights movement. stonewall national monument is the first u.s. national monument dedicated to lgbtq+ rights and history. president barack obama designated it as a national monument on june 24, 2016 during lgbtq+ pride month. 
the anti-lgbtq action from the national park service is the latest in a list of anti-lgbtq actions from the trump administration. on his first day in office, he signed an executive order targeting lgbtq americans around what he described as “gender ideology extremism.”
the opening text of the stonewall national monument website used to read: “before the 1960s, almost everything about living openly as a lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or queer (lgbtq+) person was illegal. the stonewall uprising on june 28, 1969 is a milestone in the quest for lgbtq+ civil rights and provided momentum for a movement.”
what used to be correctly listed as lgbtq+ was changed to ‘lgb’.
“transgender or queer” were removed along with the “tq+” part of the lgbtq+ acronym from the opening text as well as a link to a resource on ‘lgbtq+ flags.’
glaad has tracked more than 227 attacks by president trump and his administration on lgbtq people through its glaad accountability tracker.","['new', 'york', 'ny', 'february', 'glaad', 'world',

the online announcement for the protest described its purpose: “no lgb without the t. the trump administration has erased trans people from the stonewall national monument website… we will not allow trump and his hatemongers to redefine our communities or our history!”

the rally lasted for over an hour and was hosted by jay w. walker, a co-founder of the reclaim pride coalition. the lineup included a diverse array of speakers from the community.

erik bottcher, nyc city council member for district 3 and a relentless advocate for lgbtq people, addressed the crowd: “we are here to send a message to donald trump: we will not let you erase the existence of our trans siblings. we will not let you cleave our community apart and divide us. we are one community. and now is the time for gays and lesbians and cisgender members of our community to stand up against what is happening. … we will win, because we always win in the end.” 

dr. carla smith, the ceo of the new york city lgbtq community center, located just a few minutes’ walk from the historic site, also spoke at the rally and emphasized that our community can always access www.stonewallforever.org – a digital archive for all to see and know our history that will never go away. she said in part: “our history exists with our trans siblings having always led the way. that cannot be erased.”

state senator brad holyman, also a longtime advocate for the local lgbtq community in new york city, spoke similarly on the importance of retaining our stories. “we need to make sure transgender history remains american history,” he said in his remarks.

angelica christina, trans activist and board member of the stonewall gives back initiative, gave a moving speech reminding us of tireless trans leaders who have been in this fight before, like sylvia rivera and marsha p. johnson; and urging support for transgender, nonbinary, and intersex americans. “trans people have always been at the forefront and on the frontlines,” she said. “what we’re seeing play out in real time by this administration … is criminalizing trans people for existing and decriminalizing the real criminals like donald trump.” she called on the national park service to immediately restore the accurate website language. “trans people exist. we are not going anywhere. we will continue to fight for our rights, so the legacy of our transcestors will remain in the universe. silence is complicity. … we will not go back. i see you. we uplift you, we love you, we will fight for you.”

cathy marino thomas, a grassroots activist during the fight for the freedom to marry and now a board member of gilbert baker foundation, inspired the crowd by reminding us of baker’s words when he created the original pride flag in 1987. “the rainbow is a symbol of harmony, and if we eliminate any color from the rainbow flag, we destroy the integrity of the rainbow. so too, with the family of man. if we eliminate any one group, or gender, or race, or anyone for whatever reason, we destroy the integrity of the family of man.”

the crowd regularly burst out into cheers and chants: “what do we want? justice! when do we want it? now!” “when trans lives are under attack, what do we do? stand up, fight back!” activists like marti gould cummings, a board member of equality new york, urged democrats in washington, dc to use their platform to take bolder action. “it is because of our trans elders that we are here,” they said. “this legislation removing trans people from a park is a distraction. we are here to tell trans kids that they are worth it; that they deserve to grow into trans adults … we cannot have another nex benedict,” they said, referring to the trans and indigenous teenager from oklahoma who died after being assaulted in a school restroom and lacking any support from oklahoma’s conservative leadership or superintendent of public schools.

jason rosenberg of the gender liberation movement led the crowd in a chant: “democrats, have a spine; trans lives are on the line.”

stacy lentz, the co-owner of the stonewall inn bar across the street from the monument and the ceo of the stonewall gives back initiative, immediately blasted the trump administration for its actions shortly after the news broke.

“this blatant act of erasure not only distorts the truth of our history, but it also dishonors the immense contributions of transgender individuals — especially transgender women of color — who were at the forefront of the stonewall riots and the broader fight for lgbtq+ rights,” she said in a statement.

“let us be clear: stonewall is transgender history. marsha p. johnson, sylvia rivera, and countless other trans and gender-nonconforming individuals fought bravely, and often at great personal risk, to push back against oppressive systems. their courage, sacrifice, and leadership were central to the resistance we now celebrate as the foundation of the modern lgbtq+ rights movement.”

the stonewall inn bar is the site of the 1969 riots that launched the lgbtq+ rights movement. stonewall national monument is the first u.s. national monument dedicated to lgbtq+ rights and history. president barack obama designated it as a national monument on june 24, 2016 during lgbtq+ pride month.

in addition, the stonewall national monument visitors center, an independent and queer owned non-profit venue located across the street from the stonewall national monument – owned by pride live and unaffiliated with the monument or national park service – slammed the change by the trump administration to the agency’s website:

092aad5a-4766-4df4-a62b-39d9830bbd64,pro,glaad and one iowa action statements as iowa considers rolling back codified civil rights protections,"['glaad', 'iowa', 'action', 'statement', 'iowa', 'consider', 'roll', 'codify', 'civil', 'right', 'protection']",glaad,none listed,https://glaad.org/releases/glaad-and-one-iowa-action-statements-as-iowa-considers-rolling-back-codified-civil-rights-protections/,2/26/2025,"(new york, ny – february 26, 2025) – glaad, the world’s largest lgbtq media advocacy organization, along with one iowa action, a statewide advocacy group working to preserve and advance the rights of lgbtq iowans, are responding to news that iowa lawmakers are considering the iowa civil rights removal act (hf583 and sf418), which would make iowa the first state in the country to roll back existing civil rights protections on the basis of gender identity from its state code.

about half of the states in america have existing nondiscrimination and civil rights laws that include explicit protections for transgender people. iowa has had its protections in place since 2007, when legislators updated the state’s nondiscrimination law with bipartisan support to explicitly include transgender people.

glaad’s president and ceo, sarah kate ellis (she/her), released the following statement:
“at a time when transgender people are facing baseless attacks by president trump and vile anti-transgender rhetoric and violence in our communities, iowa lawmakers should be ashamed to be piling on the vitriol with this extreme bill. nondiscrimination laws are critical to protecting our most vulnerable and marginalized communities, and ensuring that no one is treated differently because of who they are. at a time when transgender people are under unprecedented attack, protections should be enforced and strengthened, not removed to embolden discrimination. this is a red alert wakeup call that if they can do this to trans people, all civil rights protections could be at risk. glaad’s most recent tracking of anti-lgbtq incidents shows the safety of all iowans is at stake. transgender people are our family members, fellow community members, and loved ones; and we need to support them and all vulnerable communities more than ever.”

according to one iowa action, a statewide advocacy group working to preserve and advance the rights of lgbtq iowans through grassroots efforts, policy work, voter education and advocacy, the bill’s components include a full-scale removal of transgender iowans’ civil rights protections, restroom restrictions, birth certificate restrictions, a legal redefinition of sex that attempts to administratively erase trans people from existence, and more.

one iowa’s executive director, max mowitz, condemned the proposal last month when it was first introduced: “if this bill passes, many basic life necessities iowans take for granted will become much more difficult for transgender iowans to access. landlords will legally be able to deny them the ability to rent an apartment, banks will be able to deny them a car loan, and hotels will be able to turn them away for no other reason than because they are transgender. this bill gives those who wish to discriminate the ability to put their thumb on the scales of the american dream.”

since june 1, 2022, glaad’s alert desk has tracked over 20 anti-lgbtq incidents in iowa. these include at least six violent attacks, such as someone throwing an open box cutter at a high school gsa participating in a parade in marion, and an assault on a black gay student at grinnell college. other incidents include four cases of vandalism and a bomb threat against an lgbtq-inclusive junior high school in altoona.

the williams institute of ucla estimates that there are more than 7,000 transgender people living in iowa who could lose protections as a result of this bill. hundreds of people have protested the bill at the capital in des moines in recent days.

a351c1f4-3f30-4f28-b103-d1d21714ba9f,pro,mixed results in media survey of trump’s anti-transgender executive orders,"['mixed', 'result', 'medium', 'survey', 'trump', 'anti', 'transgender', 'executive', 'order']",glaad,none listed,https://glaad.org/media-analysis-executive-orders/,3/3/2025,"among president trump’s first executive orders were those targeting transgender people’s identity, military service, access to health care, access to education, and access to sports. 

glaad analyzed 35 first day stories from six of the largest media outlets. only 13 of 35 stories included at least one quote by a transgender person. day one stories have a greater reach than follow-on coverage. the survey found:

only 6 of the 13 stories that included a transgender person stories had facts and context to counter white house rhetoric
17 of the 22 stories that did not include a transgender person also did not include a quote from an lgbtq person or group
7 of the 35 stories included quotes from professionals with experience in the topics being discussed
4 stories quoted an anonymous “white house official” who discussed restricting the rights of transgender people. 
only one of 35 stories quoted a white house staff member by name. 
outlets that have out lgbtq reporters, reporters with established relationships with lgbtq advocacy groups, and outlets with units dedicated to coverage of diverse topics, were more likely to include transgender voices and accurate context.
“transgender americans are clearly under assault by the trump administration, including unprecedented attempts to erase and dehumanize,” glaad president and ceo sarah kate ellis (she/her) said. “it is imperative that media covering the administration’s efforts to exclude transgender people report on this pattern of inaccurate, animus-filled behavior, and include the voices of transgender people and facts about lives and experiences. reporters must take extra time to include the community, check facts, include context, and challenge what is being said and proposed.”



“when only 28% of non-lgbtq americans say they personally know a trans person, news stories about our community are an extraordinary opportunity to humanize, or demonize us,” said glaad’s shane diamond (he/him), director of communications and trans advocacy. “glaad’s study shows that responsible, accurate, and inclusive coverage is possible, even with the demands of a busy news cycle.  all media must commit to basic standards that hold the administration accountable and accurately reflect the community under attack.”

glaad’s survey noted whether the stories: 

include a quote from a transgender person or trans-led advocacy group
include a queer rights advocate group (lgbq but not t)
include transgender person/ community member personally impacted
additionally, glaad evaluated for context, about the trans community, about authoritarianism/project 2025, about white house staff leading anti-trans eos, or for comment from a non-lgbtq third party expert in the subject area.

the mixed results found that transgender voices were included in the following outlets and stories about the executive orders:

abc news: 3 of 5 stories.
associated press: 2 of 5 stories; one story included multiple trans voices.
cbs news: 2 of 5 stories.
nbc news: 3 of 5 stories.
reuters: 1 of 5 stories.
usa today: 2 of 5 stories.
17 of the 22 stories that did not include a transgender person also did not include a quote from an lgbtq person or group.

a day one story from reuters about the order titled “defending women from gender ideology extremism” did not include a transgender person’s response, but did include a one from an lgbtq advocacy leader. it did not challenge the administration to define or clarify “gender ideology,” a term created by opponents of transgender people as a way to dehumanize them and justify discrimination. unfortunately, the story also repeats rhetoric from the executive order without clarification or challenge, including inaccurate or undefined claims such as “an individual’s immutable biological classification.” 



a usa today story about trump’s executive order that “recognizes two sexes” does not include an lgbtq voice, or an expert in science or medicine to challenge inaccurate claims. the article quotes an unnamed “incoming white house official” and “trump staffer” who previewed and amplified the order’s inaccurate, baseless rhetoric. the story did not challenge the accuracy, legality, need for, or practicality of implementing an order intent on targeting transgender people by ignoring scientific consensus that human biology is diverse and complex, and that gender diversity is recognized throughout history and cultures. the order, and the story, also neglect the reality of intersex people, who are born with diverse sex characteristics that can be both female and male, and whose experiences helped lead the change to passports allowing for gender neutral markers.

by contrast, a usa today story in early february about an executive order targeting transgender women in sports includes a transgender person’s response as well as important context and legal expertise on the challenges to the order. it includes questions about directives to the education department to implement and enforce the order while trump has promised to eliminate the department. 



an abc news story about the administration’s plans to target transgender people serving in the military does not include a transgender person, service member, or legal advocate, even though the proposal was thoroughly covered in the first trump administration. the story also repeats, without challenge, baseless rhetoric in the order targeting the integrity of the entire transgender community. 

another abc news story includes voices of transgender people and lgbtq advocacy groups, as well as medical researchers and legal experts, to explain the falsehoods included in the “two sexes” order. context about intersex people is included.


outlets that employ and assign out lgbtq reporters or have units dedicated to coverage of diverse topics produce stories that are more consistently inclusive and accurate. these stories draw on reporter and team experience in covering lgbtq people and topics, close connections and trust with sources, and familiarity with research and facts helpful to all readers and viewers.



stories from the associated press were uniformly inclusive of the lgbtq community, with most stories including at least one or more transgender and lgbtq advocates’ voices. a story about trump’s effort to criminalize best practice health care for minors under 19 included multiple trans voices and noted that the order’s graphic language conflicted with medical expertise and research supporting the care. ap’s coverage is important and influential as it is carried by thousands of outlets across the country, and often referred to in other outlets’ coverage, such as this piece by cbs news. 



nbc’s comprehensive coverage of the health care order included responses from transgender people and multiple citations of research showing the effectiveness of the care and its support by every major medical association. earlier coverage of the first executive orders failed to include transgender voices, while quoting liberally from a “white house official” whose language—“restoring sanity”—was defamatory and unchallenged. a story about trump’s education order includes a mention about “indoctrination” in schools without pushing officials to define what that means or provide evidence of it happening. the story was mostly focused on the effort to defund public schools via choice vouchers, and did not include a transgender person or lgbtq group. 



outlets covering the trump white house and its unprecedented targeting of transgender people can improve the accuracy of their stories and representation of the community by establishing protocols for coverage:

seek and include transgender voices in stories about transgender people.
center facts over rhetoric.
include context and consequences. 
quote administration sources by name and title, particularly if they are speaking negatively about marginalized people and proposing to restrict rights of any marginalized group. 
research and include a history of anti-lgbtq activism and animus by the trump white house officials and affiliated groups.
additional background:

glaad: lgbtq legal groups have filed at least nine lawsuits against the anti-trans executive orders, four of which have been blocked in federal courts.
gallup: 9.3% of americans identify as lgbtq
glaad has documented 240+ attacks in policy and rhetoric from the trump administration via the trump accountability tracker
glaad accountability project: 200+ profiles of public figures who use their platforms to spread disinformation and harmful policies targeting lgbtq people
glaad: terms to avoid: “gender ideology,” “transgenderism,” “biological boy/girl.” these are inaccurate terms not used by transgender people or the medical community. they are terms used to dehumanize trans people and undermine authentic identity. “biological boy” is inaccurate and not a term used by the medical or scientific community because it does not reflect the proven diversity of human biology or the reality of intersex people.
glaad has documented the trump administration’s harmful attempts to erase lgbtq people on government websites, including health-related informational sites, and the censoring of the word “transgender” from the national park service’s site about the stonewall national monument that attempts to remove the contributions of transgender people from the stonewall riots and the lgbtq movement.","['president', 'trump', 'executive', 'order', 'target', 'transgender', 'people', 'identity', 'military', 'service', 'access', 'health', 'care', 'access', 'education', 'access', 'sport',

read the study here.
downloadable graphics of the glaad study findings are available here.

glaad evaluated 35 first day stories from six of the largest media outlets about trump executive orders targeting transgender people’s identity, military service, access to health care, access to education, and access to sports:

only 13 of 35 stories included at least one quote by a transgender person.
only 6 of the 13 stories that included a transgender person had facts and context to counter white house inaccurate and harmful rhetoric.
17 of the 22 stories that did not include a transgender person also did not include a quote from an lgbtq person or group.
7 of the 35 stories included quotes from professionals with experience in the topics being discussed.
4 stories quoted an anonymous “white house official” who discussed restricting the rights of transgender people.
“transgender americans are clearly under assault by the trump administration, including unprecedented attempts to erase and dehumanize,” glaad president and ceo sarah kate ellis (she/her) said. “it is imperative that media covering the administration’s efforts to exclude transgender people report on this pattern of inaccurate, animus-filled behavior, and include the voices of transgender people and facts about lives and experiences. reporters must take extra time to include the community, check facts, include context, and challenge what is being said and proposed.”

“when only 28% of non-lgbtq americans say they personally know a trans person, news stories about our community are an extraordinary opportunity to humanize, or demonize us,” said glaad’s shane diamond (he/him), director of communications and transgender advocacy. “glaad’s study shows that responsible, accurate, and inclusive coverage is possible, even with the demands of a busy news cycle.  all media must commit to basic standards that hold the administration accountable and ensure their stories accurately reflect the community under attack.”

about the study
glaad reviewed first day stories of executive orders regarding transgender people, noting whether the stories:
include a quote from a transgender person or trans-led advocacy group
include a queer rights advocate group (lgbq but not t)
include transgender person/ community member personally impacted
additionally, glaad evaluated for context:
about the trans community or,
about authoritarianism/project 2025 or,
about white house staff leading anti-trans eos or,
from a non-lgbtq third party expert in the subject area.

mixed results
transgender voices were included in the following outlets and stories about the executive orders:
abc news: 3 of 5 stories.
associated press: 2 of 5 stories; one story included multiple trans voices.
cbs news: 2 of 5 stories.
nbc news: 3 of 5 stories.
reuters: 1 of 5 stories.
usa today: 2 of 5 stories.

17 of the 22 stories that did not include a transgender person also did not include a quote from an lgbtq person or group.

coverage analysis
a day one story from reuters about the order titled “defending women from gender ideology extremism” did not include a transgender person’s response, but did include a one from an lgbtq advocacy leader. it did not challenge the administration to define or clarify “gender ideology,” a term created by opponents of transgender people as a way to dehumanize them and justify discrimination.

trump curtails protections around diversity, lgbtq rights

the story also repeats rhetoric from the executive order without clarification or challenge, including inaccurate or undefined claims such as “immutable biological classification.”

a usa today story about trump’s executive order that “recognizes two sexes” does not include an lgbtq voice or an expert in science or medicine to challenge inaccurate claims. the article quotes an unnamed “incoming white house official” and “trump staffer” who previewed and amplified the order’s inaccurate, baseless rhetoric. the story did not challenge the accuracy, legality, need for, or practicality of implementing an order intent on targeting transgender people and that ignores scientific consensus of human biology as diverse and complex, and that gender diversity is recognized throughout history and cultures. the order, and the story, also neglect the reality of intersex people, who are born with diverse sex characteristics that can be both female and male, and whose experiences helped lead the change to passports allowing for gender neutral markers.

by contrast, a usa today story in early february about an executive order targeting transgender women in sports includes a transgender person’s response as well as important context and legal expertise on the challenges to the order. it includes questions about directives to the education department to implement and enforce the order while trump has promised to eliminate the department.

an abc news story about the administration’s plans to target transgender people serving in the military does not include a transgender person, service member, or legal advocate, even though a similar proposal was thoroughly covered in the first trump administration. the story also repeats, without challenge, baseless rhetoric in the order targeting the integrity of the entire transgender community.

an associated press story about trump’s effort to criminalize best practice health care for minors under 19 included multiple trans voices and noted that the order’s graphic language conflicted with medical expertise and research supporting the care. ap’s coverage is important and influential as it is carried by thousands of outlets across the country, and often referred to in other outlets’ coverage, such as this piece by cbs news.

outlets that employ and assign out lgbtq reporters or have units dedicated to coverage of diverse topics consistently produce stories that are more inclusive and accurate. these stories draw on reporter and team experience in covering lgbtq people and topics, close connections and trust with sources, and familiarity with research and facts helpful to all readers and viewers.

nbc news’ comprehensive coverage of the health care order included responses from transgender people and multiple citations of research showing the effectiveness of the care and its support by every major medical association. earlier coverage of the first executive orders failed to include transgender voices, while quoting liberally from a “white house official” whose language – “restoring sanity” – was defamatory and unchallenged. an nbc news story about trump’s education order includes a mention about “indoctrination” in schools that did not challenge officials to define or provide evidence of it happening. the story was mostly focused on the effort to defund public schools via choice vouchers, and did not include response from a transgender person or lgbtq group.

best practices reporting
outlets covering the trump white house and its unprecedented targeting of transgender people can improve the accuracy of their stories and representation of the community by establishing protocols for coverage:

seek and include transgender voices in stories about transgender people.
center facts over rhetoric.
include context and consequences.
quote administration sources by name and title, particularly if they are speaking negatively about marginalized people and proposing to restrict rights of any marginalized group.
research and include any history of anti-lgbtq activism and animus by the trump white house officials and affiliated groups.

6339946f-f1c7-44f3-b543-59bc156b36fe,pro,"fact sheet: misleading narratives about transgender people and restrooms, locker rooms, and other single-sex spaces","['fact', 'sheet', 'mislead', 'narrative', 'transgender', 'people', 'restroom', 'locker', 'room', 'single', 'sex', 'space']",glaad,none listed,https://glaad.org/fact-sheet-misleading-narratives-about-transgender-people-and-restrooms-locker-rooms-and-other-single-sex-spaces/,3/4/2025,"current proposals in the us that prohibit transgender people from being able to use public restrooms that align with who they are (e.g. proposals forcing transgender men to use women’s bathrooms, and trans women to use the men’s room) are constructed on intentional falsehoods. this trend of inflammatory fearmongering and demonization is a threat to the health and safety of transgender people, as well as cisgender people perceived to be trans. safety and privacy is important to all of us, and banning transgender people from these spaces does nothing to make other people safer.

these discriminatory endeavors are part of the broader, escalating wave of attacks on basic civil rights. these attacks include attempts to ban essential health care for transgender youth and adults, restrict participation in sports, block accurate identity documents, curb freedom of expression, endanger transgender inmates by incarcerating them in institutions inconsistent with their gender identity, and suppress and even criminalize books, education, and culture by and about lgbtq people.

all of these efforts are part of the same broader goal to roll back the clock on acceptance for transgender people, and make it increasingly difficult for transgender americans to go about their daily lives.

reporters should include these facts when reporting on these issues:

current legislative and executive branch efforts to restrict transgender people and youth from public restrooms and similar spaces are based more in fearmongering than facts. research shows no evidence of safety risks for cisgender people when trans people use restrooms aligning with their authentic gender; in fact, transgender people are at elevated risk for harassment and violence in these spaces.
according to the movement advancement project, bathroom bans can result in “high rates of harassment and violence against transgender people as well as cisgender people, particularly women who do not conform to traditional ideas of femininity.”
harming someone in a public restroom is already illegal. bathroom bans often have no guidance on enforcement, and can result in invasions of privacy for everyone when individual citizens randomly (and often mistakenly) attempt to enforce these vaguely constructed statutes.
president donald trump’s executive orders inaccurately state that there are only two sexes, ignoring the reality of intersex people and decades of established medical and scientific research about sex and gender diversity throughout history and cultures. that’s why every major medical association and health authority in the world recognizes and supports health care for transgender people. president trump has attempted to use his orders to impose discriminatory anti-trans bathroom bans for restrooms on federal property. the executive orders do not override the us constitution, federal statutes, or established legal precedent. federal judges have already struck down many of his executive orders, while the constitutionality of others continues to be challenged in court.
imposing discrimination on transgender people at the federal level would be illegal under the supreme court’s bostock decision, which ruled that discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity is unconstitutional sex discrimination.
president trump’s executive order mandating the transfer of transgender inmates to prisons that do not align with their gender (e.g. putting transgender men in women’s prisons and transgender women in men’s prisons) endangers the safety of trans prisoners, and is also likely unconstitutional. the supreme court ruled, in a 1994 case brought by a trans inmate, that it is the government’s duty to protect prisoners from violence. the decision noted the particular vulnerability of trans inmates.
as of early march 2025, 600 anti-transgender bills have been introduced nationwide, and nine have passed. in 2024, 674 anti-trans bills were proposed and 50 passed. of the potential bills in 2025 so far, 44 seek to restrict transgender bathroom access.
transgender people should not be unfairly discriminated against and should be allowed to “use facilities and participate in activities that match who they are,” notes the aclu. “we believe it is not only the right answer from a human point of view, but it is also legally required by statutory and constitutional bans on sex discrimination.”
when a bill or proposal explicitly addresses transgender people and the use of restrooms, locker rooms, or other single-sex spaces, journalists should contextualize it with the facts above, speak with transgender people and organizations to include their perspectives, and make note of broadscale patterns of targeting trans people with false, harmful, and dehumanizing narratives in efforts to retract their basic civil rights.

harvard school of public health: a 2019 lgbtq teen study, an anonymous survey of more than 3,600 youth ages 13 to 17, revealed that transgender and nonbinary teens face a higher risk of sexual assault when forced to use bathrooms and locker rooms that don’t match their gender identity: “36% of transgender or gender-nonbinary students with restricted bathroom or locker room access reported being sexually assaulted in the last 12 months.”
map/glsen: “singling out transgender students and telling them they must use separate restrooms is humiliating and discriminatory … forcing transgender students into restrooms that don’t match the gender they live every day puts their safety at even greater risk.” nearly three-quarters of transgender students (70%) say they have “avoided bathrooms because they felt unsafe or uncomfortable.”

the trump white house has announced special guests at the address to congress who will attempt to continue the administration’s unprecedented campaign targeting transgender people. here are the facts:

records show january littlejohn of tallahassee, florida, worked with the school district to support her nonbinary child, before littlejohn sued the district with lawyers from a national anti-lgbtq group.
payton mcnabb, a former high school volleyball player injured during a match with a transgender player, is a paid spokesperson for an anti-transgender group that also advocates to ban health care and to force schools to dangerously out lgbtq youth without their consent.
“biological man” is not a term used by the medical community, but is used by opponents of trans people to fearmonger and spread disinformation. scientific research shows human biology is complex and that sex and gender diversity has existed throughout history and cultures.
additional background:

payton mcnabb played high school volleyball in north carolina, where she suffered a traumatic brain injury after being hit in the head with a volleyball during a match with a transgender player in 2022. mcnabb has since been hired by opponents of transgender people to use her injury to argue that all trans youth should be denied the chance to play sports as their authentic selves.

mcnabb works with a group that aggressively lobbies against transgender people, the so-called independent women’s forum.
iwf activates against transgender people under the guise of “protecting women,” yet its actions do nothing to protect women:
pushing bans on essential health care for transgender people
supporting the harmful practice of outing lgbtq students without their consent, without consideration of the risks to doing so to unsupportive parents. up to 40% of all homeless youth are lgbtq.
urging the dangerous and illegal relocation of detainees to facilities that do not match their gender identity, action that has been blocked by multiple federal courts as cruel and unusual punishment and a violation of the u.s. constitution.
ignoring research that shows states that include transgender students in sports actually have more girls playing than states with bans.
mcnabb is among more than 200,000 high school and college female volleyball players who have reported injuries including head trauma since 2012. the vast majority of these injuries and accidents involve cisgender competitors and teammates. no one is calling for cisgender athletes involved in accidents to be banned from sports.
there has been no legislation proposed at the federal level by anti-trans activists that addresses actual problems of safety and equity for women and girls’ sports, including regulations to protect athletes from abusive coaches and fans, ensure equal facilities and marketing, or ways to expand access to health care and recovery, for all players including people like mcnabb.
independent women’s forum’s legal director, may mailman, recently transitioned to serve as white house legal counsel. mailman has promoted the white house’s unprecedented campaign against transgender people. mailman and iwf worked with riley gaines, who has parlayed her fifth place finish into a career of testifying in states she does not live in to support full bans on transgender youth as young as kindergarten from playing sports.

january littlejohn filed a lawsuit against the leon county school district in tallahassee, florida in 2021, claiming the school discussed restrooms and name change requests with their child without their consent. however, a public records request showed that the family had ongoing communications with the school and gave approval to let their child and their teachers lead on appropriate school protocols.

the facts are:

records show january littlejohn of tallahassee, florida, worked with the school district to support her nonbinary child before littlejohn sued the district with lawyers from a national anti-lgbtq group.
payton mcnabb, a former high school volleyball player injured during a match with a transgender player, is a paid spokesperson for an anti-transgender group that also advocates to ban medically necessary, best practice health care and to force schools to dangerously out lgbtq youth without their consent.
“biological man” is not a term used by the medical or scientific community, but is used by opponents of trans people to spread fear and disinformation. scientific research shows human biology is more complex and that sex and gender diversity has existed throughout history and cultures.
additional background:

payton mcnabb played high school volleyball in north carolina, where she suffered a traumatic brain injury after being hit with a volleyball during a match with a transgender player in 2022. mcnabb has since been hired by opponents of transgender people to use her injury to argue that all trans youth should be denied the chance to play sports as their authentic selves.

mcnabb is a paid spokesperson for a group that aggressively lobbies against transgender people, the so-called independent women’s forum (iwf).
iwf has ties to project 2025, has lobbied against access to contraception, and activates against transgender people under the guise of “protecting women” but has taken actions that do not protect women and instead tries to harm lgbtq people, including:
pushing bans on essential health care;
supporting the harmful practice of outing lgbtq students without their consent, without consideration of the risks to doing so to unsupportive parents. up to 40% of all homeless youth are lgbtq;
urging the dangerous and illegal relocation of detainees to facilities that do not match their gender identity, action that has been blocked by multiple federal courts as cruel and unusual punishment and a violation of the u.s. constitution.
mcnabb is among more than 214,000 high school and college female athletes injured while playing volleyball since 2012. the vast majority of these injuries and accidents involve cisgender competitors and teammates. no one is calling for cisgender athletes involved in injuries and accidents to be banned from sports.
there has been no legislation proposed at the federal level by anti-trans activists that addresses actual problems of safety and equity for women and girls’ sports, including how to protect athletes from abusive coaches and fans, ensure equal facilities, pay, and marketing, or ways to expand access to health care and recovery, for all players including people like mcnabb.
independent women’s forum’s former legal director, may mailman, recently transitioned to serve in the white house. mailman has promoted the white house’s unprecedented campaign against transgender people. mailman and iwf worked with riley gaines, who has parlayed her fifth place finish into a career of testifying in states she does not live in to support full bans on transgender youth as young as kindergarten from playing sports.

fb97fa44-2c6f-428c-8fa3-5aa8f0e70096,pro,"lgbtq advocates rally, resist ‘tsunami of anti-trans hate’ at ‘pride to the capitol’","['lgbtq', 'advocate', 'rally', 'resist', 'tsunami', 'anti', 'trans', 'hate', 'pride', 'capitol']",glaad,darian aaron,https://glaad.org/lgbtq-advocates-rally-resist-tsunami-of-anti-trans-hate-at-pride-to-the-capitol/,3/5/2025,"on march 4, for the second time since the start of the 2025 state legislative session, over 200 hundred lgbtq georgians and their allies descended on the state capitol in downtown atlanta as at least seven anti-lgbtq bills inched closer to becoming law.

“pride to the capitol” included more than a dozen lgbtq equality groups from across the state along with the human rights campaign to help everyday citizens mobilize their messages and meet with lawmakers to share their stories. the event wrapped with a rally at liberty plaza and a press conference inside the capitol. the day-long action arrived just before crossover day on march 6, which marks the deadline for bills to pass in at least one chamber to have a chance of becoming law.

“pride to the capitol” served as a direct response to what advocates described as a “tsunami of anti-trans hate” from georgia lawmakers who made restricting the civil rights of transgender georgians a day-one legislative priority.

“this is not a time to sit on our hands,” said demarcus beckham, macon-based regional organizer for hrc and rally host. “we need people who are willing to confront those bullies across the street [inside the state capitol]. we don’t need any more allies; we need accomplices.”

the stakes couldn’t have been more precise for danieelle, a transgender woman at the rally who requested to only be identified by her first name out of fear for her safety. she tells glaad she is often overwhelmed by the level of hatred directed at the transgender community by elected officials.

“it’s really depressing that it’s 2025, and this is still where we are,” danieelle said. “to have it directed at you personally is really scary. you want to think about leaving the country, but then you also want to stick up for people you know who can’t stand up for themselves,” she said.

“whether it is intentional or just complete ignorance, they should understand that they represent us—georgians,” beckham said as he looked out into the crowd with signs that read “equality now” and “human.”

as the rally commenced, so did the advancement of sb 36, a bill proponents say is necessary to protect religious rights, while lgbtq advocates warned it would be a license to use religious belief to discriminate against lgbtq people and other marginalized groups. the bill passed along party lines in a 32-23 vote in the senate on tuesday as lgbtq advocates inside and outside the capitol appealed to lawmakers to resist curtailing lgbtq progress.

out legislator, sen. rashaun kemp (d-south fulton), told the ajc that georgians already have religious freedom. the only thing the “bill does is use their religion as a free pass to discriminate.”

“when i go to church with my husband and my two kids, i get to worship and praise god with no limitations, and you can actually do the same,” he said.

“we’ve seen this political playbook before,” rep. sam park (d-107) said inside the statehouse during the press conference. park is also an out georgia legislator.

“when politicians fail to address the real challenges that georgians face, like the skyrocketing cost of living, a broken healthcare system, and a need for better economic opportunities, they look for scapegoats instead of doing the work to solve real problems affecting every georgian.”

transgender advocate, rally speaker, and history-making miss georgia contestant bella bautista defiantly echoed the sentiments of park, kemp, and hundreds of lgbtq people inside liberty plaza.

“they want us to believe that being our authentic self is too much; too controversial, too political,” bautista said. “but here’s the truth: i am not a controversy. i am not a debate. i am living proof that we belong. they may try to silence us, but you cannot silence a movement.”

“there have been moments where i questioned my place in a world that has often tried to erase us; erase black men, erase black trans men, men like me,” said dr. elijah nicholas, founder and executive director of the global trans equity project and a rally speaker.

“for every single step i’ve taken—every moment of doubt—every triumph has taught me one thing: i am here. i am worthy. and i am not invisible,” nicholas said.

for james waldrop, 80, being present and visible at the rally held a significant meaning as a queer man who came of age and into the awareness of his sexual orientation and gender identity during the silent generation. waldrop tells glaad that for 70 years, he has lived a “feminine life inside a male body.”

“i am who i am, no matter what i look like. and that’s why i say my sexual orientation is not a threat to anyone. and anyone’s sexual orientation should not be a threat to any other,” waldrop said.

waldrop says the current political climate has forced him out of his comfort zone.

“i’ve been pushed to the point that i can no longer sit and not participate,” he said. “i want to be heard, so the only way to be heard is to be out and present, and that’s what i want to be.”

the same is true for aeden rowell, 22, a transgender man and duluth, ga resident who shared his story during the press conference of being raised in conservative jackson county, ga, in a religious family who were members of the same episcopal church as gov. brian kemp.

“i played the role that was expected of me, but like any performance that lasts too long, it drained me,” rowell said.

“my religious community support gave me the strength to get me through a difficult time in my life. but that support alone could not change the way i saw myself in the mirror. i needed medical care, life-saving care, gender-affirming care, so when i looked at my reflection, i saw the person who i knew i always was,” he added.

rowell had one question for lawmakers inside the capitol working to convince their colleagues and georgians that his existence as a transgender person poses a threat.

“i ask you this: think about someone in your life who you love. if they came out to you as transgender, how would you react?” we are your friends. we are your neighbors. we are your children. we sit beside you in church pews, in classrooms, in communities with you across this state. we are not a threat, but right now, our lives are under threat,”rowell said.

still, according to jeff graham, executive director of georgia equality, there is reason for hope.

“change happens all the time. and change will happen for the transgender community here in georgia as well,” graham said.

“we are fighting laws that want to take us backward. the challenges are real, but we’ve survived it all before. we are the most resilient community imaginable. we will make sure that people have access to medical care. we will make sure that our young people have the support they need,” he added. “and we will eventually win these laws in georgia and find a day when they stop coming after us.”","['march', 'second', 'time', 'start', 'state', 'legislative', 'session', 'lgbtq', 'georgian', 'ally', 'descend', 'state', 'capitol', 'downtown', 'atlanta', 'seven', 'anti', 'lgbtq', 'bill',

the preliminary injunction was issued in the legal challenge talbott v. trump, brought by lgbtq legal groups glad law and the national center for lesbian rights. they are representing six active service members, two people actively seeking enlistment, and an additional 12 plaintiffs who joined the case since the filing on january 28th.

the court order detailed the transgender military members’ skills, service, and honors earned:

“together they have provided over 130 years of military service. they have served in roles ranging from senior military science instructor to artillery platoon commander to intelligence analyst to satellite operator to operations research analyst to naval flight officer to weapons officer.”
“they have deployed around the globe, from afghanistan to poland to korea to iraq to kuwait to the uss ronald reagan and uss george w. bush. one is presently deployed to an active combat zone.”
“they have earned more than 80 commendations including: a bronze star; two global war on terrorism service medals; two global war on terrorism expeditionary medals; numerous meritorious service medals; numerous commendation medals; air and space outstanding unit awards; and the military outstanding volunteer service medal, among many others. “
“plaintiffs’ service records alone are exhibit a for the proposition that transgender persons can have the warrior ethos, physical and mental health, selflessness, honor, integrity, and discipline to ensure military excellence. defendants [trump department of justice lawyers] agree”
excerpt

the ruling noted the lack of evidence to support a ban on transgender military service in the executive order or in the followup memo by defense secretary pete hegseth:

“president trump issued eo14183 seven days after taking office. no one knows what he relied on, if anything.”
“there is no evidence that they consulted with uniformed military leaders before doing so. neither document contains any analysis nor cites any data.”
“eo14183 and the hegseth policy provide nothing to support defendants’ view that transgender military service is inconsistent with military readiness.”
the court ruled the order violates the equal protection clause of the u.s. constitution, promotes discrimination based on transgender status and sex, and “is soaked in animus.”

u.s. district court judge ana reyes continued: “its language is unabashedly demeaning, its policy stigmatizes transgender persons as inherently unfit, and its conclusions bear no relation to fact.”

“thousands of transgender servicemembers have sacrificed—some risking their lives—to ensure for others the very equal protection rights the military ban seeks to deny them.”

the opinion supported its claim of administration animus with examples of the trump administration’s targeting of transgender people writ large:

“plaintiffs are likely to succeed on their claim that the military ban is motivated by animus and is not tailored to meet its stated goals. but, as they say, there is more, for the military ban does not stand alone.”
executive orders disparaging transgender identity, attempting to block access to health care and education, accurate passports, and censorship on federal websites of accurate terms to describe transgender people including on health agency sites, a “stop bullying” site, the site to protect missing and exploited children, and the national park service’s site for the stonewall national monument.
“the flurry of government actions directed at transgender persons—denying them everything from necessary medical care to access to homeless shelters—must give pause to any court asked to consider whether one such order under review furthers a legitimate government interest free of animus.”


“we’re grateful our plaintiffs, and all transgender members of the military, are protected from this egregious ban,” the national center for lesbian rights stated in a post on bluesky.

“when you put on the uniform, differences fall away and what matters is your ability to do the job,” said nicolas talbott, second lieutenant, army, whose name is on the lawsuit challenging the order.

“my being transgender has no bearing on my dedication to the mission, my commitment to my unit, or my ability to perform my duties in accordance with the high standards expected of me and every servicemember,” lt. talbott said.

“i’ve spent more than half my life in the army, including combat in afghanistan,” said kate cole, sergeant first class, army. “removing qualified transgender soldiers like me means an exodus of experienced personnel who fill key positions and can’t be easily replaced, putting the burden on our fellow soldiers left behind. that’s just wrong — and it destabilizes our armed forces.”

“this ruling shows the trump administration’s discriminatory attempt to bar transgender americans from serving in the military is unconstitutional and does nothing to make our country safer and stronger,” glaad president and ceo sarah kate ellis said.

“transgender military members are already serving capably and honorably, having met the required rigorous health and readiness standards,” ellis continued. “the current ‘commander in chief’ and his staff continue to threaten our national defense with this baseless disinformation campaign against their fellow americans. transgender troops should continue to serve despite this politically-motivated and harmful sideshow.”

research shows that trump’s previous ban on trans service had a negative impact on military readiness, unit cohesion, and national security. 56 generals, admirals, and other leaders from every service branch condemned trump’s previous attempt to bar open service, noting it would “degrade readiness even more than the failed ‘don’t ask, don’t tell’ policy.”

the move marks the latest blow to trump’s discriminatory executive orders targeting marginalized communities. his orders attempting to end birthright citizenship, to erase transgender people administratively under federal law, to ban lifesaving health care for transgender youth under 19, and to ban diversity, equity and inclusion programs have all additionally been struck down by federal courts so far.

glaad’s president and ceo sarah kate ellis (she/her) issued the following statement:
“transgender service members have been serving openly and honorably for many years. politicizing their service is out of step with the views of the american people, compromises military readiness, and will make america less safe. with this ruling, the courts now follow countless military leaders who spoke out against this dangerous move.”

the preliminary injunction was issued in the legal challenge talbott v. trump brought forward by lgbtq legal groups glad law and the national center for lesbian rights.

in the opinion, u.s. district court judge ana reyes stated that “thousands of transgender servicemembers have sacrificed—some risking their lives—to ensure for others the very equal protection rights the military ban seeks to deny them.” judge reyes held that banning transgender service members from the military violates the equal protection clause of the u.s. constitution because it is discrimination based on transgender status and sex; and because “it is soaked in animus.”judge reyes continued: “its language is unabashedly demeaning, its policy stigmatizes transgender persons as inherently unfit, and its conclusions bear no relation to fact.”

research shows that trump’s previous ban on trans service had a negative impact on military readiness, unit cohesion, and national security. 56 generals, admirals, and other leaders from every service branch condemned trump’s previous attempt to bar open service, noting it would “degrade readiness even more than the failed ‘don’t ask, don’t tell’ policy.”

in his first days and weeks in office, trump signed five executive orders specifically targeting transgender people’s identities, health care, education, and transgender people actively and capably serving in the military as well as three more orders targeting diversity, equity, and inclusion with threats to defund educational institutions and nonprofit organizations. 10% of all trump executive orders signed so far have targeted lgbtq americans and all others from marginalized backgrounds, at every american’s expense.

991efdc6-5682-4a34-b0d3-0391295f5f79,pro,trump’s first two months: attacks on trans people outweigh voters’ economic priorities,"['trump', 'month', 'attack', 'trans', 'people', 'outweigh', 'voter', 'economic', 'priority']",glaad,none listed,https://glaad.org/trumps-trans-attacks-vs-economy/,3/20/2025,"the first two months of donald trump’s second term have revealed a dramatic misalignment between the goal of the president to relentlessly attack transgender people, and the needs and wishes of american people, including addressing the overwhelming prices of groceries and the dramatic decline in financial markets and overall health of the economy.

for his first major speech to the american people on march 6, 2025, glaad tracked trump’s references to transgender people compared to the economy. trump’s address to congress included 1,500 words targeting lgbtq people (for a duration of eight minutes), and the remarks appeared near the top of his historically long speech, at the 15-minute mark. by contrast, trump’s focus on jobs and affordability came in at 975 words. a mere nine seconds comprised the subject of jobs, specifically forcing federal workers back to the office. 

trump’s discrimination and disinformation comes at the expense of attention on the issues voters care most about. gallup polling shows 90% of 2024 voters identified the economy as extremely or very important. 

markets have lost $4 trillion since trump took office, yet he has signed five executive orders specifically targeting transgender people’s identities, health care, education, and transgender people serving in the military, as well as three more orders targeting diversity, equity, and inclusion, with threats to defund educational institutions and nonprofit organizations. ten percent of all trump executive orders signed so far have targeted lgbtq americans and all others from marginalized backgrounds, at every american’s expense. 

glaad’s trump tracker has tracked 17 anti-lgbtq moves by the president and his administration since inauguration on january 20, 2025. glaad trump tracker has noted every anti-lgbtq action trump has taken, including during his first term and prior. 

tariffs and anti-trans application of federal resources have doubly affected maine. tariff concerns have already affected local industries with deep ties to canada. a 25% tariff imposed on canadian goods by trump will cost ratepayers between $8–10 million a year, including a 5% jump in electricity bills on average. at the same time, after a high profile confrontation between president trump and gov. janet mills, six federal agencies swarmed the state to investigate transgender students in school sports. only two transgender girls are competing this school year, according to the maine principals’ association. the response was an excessive and inordinate expenditure of resources. in early march the federal government illegally halted research funding allocated to the university of maine. 

maine gov. janet mills
maine gov. janet mills
in georgia, where some of the worst anti-lgbtq legislation in the country was introduced this session—including an extreme bill to ban transgender participation in sports and impose other restrictions including health care restrictions on trans youth—the atlanta journal constitution recently released numbers estimating that discrimination lawsuits and other complaints involving transgender people have cost georgia taxpayers at least $4.1 million since 2015. that figure includes $2.1 million to settle claims, plus another $2 million in legal costs. it doesn’t include payments from private insurers or others to settle complaints against the state.”

trump’s executive orders are being blocked in court as unconstitutional and illegal. the price of eggs, housing, and health care remains uncomfortably high. focusing time and attention on targeting a small population is costly to the community being harmed and comes at every american’s expense.

international tdov was created in 2010 by trans advocate rachel crandall. crandall, the head of transgender michigan, created tdov in response to the overwhelming majority of media stories about transgender people being focused on violence. she hoped to create a day where people could celebrate the lives of transgender people, while simultaneously acknowledging that due to discrimination, not every trans person can or wants to be visible.

for many transgender people, it feels as if we are living in unprecedented times. in just the first three months of 2025, a staggering 821 anti-trans bills have been introduced in state legislatures across the country. furthermore, the current administration has targeted trans people through executive orders limiting trans people’s ability to obtain passports that accurately reflect our gender, attempted to reinstate a blanket ban on trans people serving in the military, and a number of other orders of varying enforceability aimed at erasing trans people from public life.

part of the fear-mongering around trans people is predicated on the idea that being a trans person is a new fad or phase, when the reality is that trans people have existed as long as people have existed. so for this trans day of visibility, we are spotlighting six incredible trans community elders, sharing their messages of resilience for these difficult times, and offer words of hope.

sharing their thoughts with us are acclaimed actress and singer, sandra caldwell; citizen of the oneida nation and anishinaabe tribe, and indigiqueer/two-spirit nation, grammy-winning musician and storyteller, ty defoe; president and ceo of the trans latin@ coalition, bamby salcedo; executive director of advocates for trans equality (a4te), rodrigo heng-lehtinen; celebrated academic theorist, researcher, and founder of the advanced communication technology laboratory, allucquére rosanne “sandy” stone; and houstonian and executive director of transgender education network of texas, emmett schelling.

“i have found
music to release
dancing to sweat
relatives in community
and delicious food
to nourish my soul.
in these practices,
i am alive and resilient.”

 – ty defoe

resilience and community, both past and present, were the major themes of our conversations with these trans people who transitioned many years ago. one common theme running through their answers was that community didn’t exist back in the mid-20th century in the way it does today.

sandra caldwell, who transitioned in the 1970s, said, “we weren’t allowed so much to be in community. i have to be honest about this, because i wasn’t in community. community was separated back then… the black queer community, the black gay community, black trans community, hadn’t found themselves yet. so we joined in with other communities and learned, learned from what we could get.” she continued, “the key words were, keep your head down, keep your mouth shut, and keep it moving… that kept you alive… i was stealth for a good 35 to 40 years… that allowed me to work, that allowed me to get an [acting] career going, that allowed me everything… but i was always nervous waiting for the other shoe to drop… it was the silliest thing to think about… i was worried about [getting fired due to] silly things like morals clauses in show-biz contracts, not was i doing a good job.”

sandy stone, who transitioned in the 1960s, echoed these sentiments, stating, “i didn’t have the luxury of trans support networks during transition. consequently, i had no reference for the accompanying physical, emotional, and chemical turmoil.”

she went on to explain a brief flash of community that she did experience early on, which changed everything. “during the worst of it, when i was fried, exhausted, and desperate, i encountered a trans woman who took one look at me and invited me to her home, where she offered me a meal and asked me to listen to some recorded music. it was cris williamson’s ‘changer and the changed’, and it changed my life. it was a gateway to a community, not physically present but real in both immediate and potential ways. it taught me that even being able to say, ‘they’re out there,’ can sustain you for a long time.”

where we come from and where we’ve gotten to now is something many of our interviewees took a lot of strength from. rodrigo heng-lehtinen stated, “i draw a lot of inspiration from history. right now, it’s easy to get disheartened because we’re being targeted and attacked by those in power. it’s the backlash to all the progress we made these last 20 years. but we’ve been here before. the history of the lgbtq movement, and really all social justice movements in the us, is cycles of progress and backlash and progress again. it’s cyclical. that doesn’t make it easy, it still hurts. but hurting is not the same as giving up. we’ve made it through before. we will make it through again. that’s not naiveté, it’s history.”

the contrast between where we were 60 years ago to now became a main area of discussion; especially the ways in which community is a source of strength for us that we may not have had in the past to weather hostile storms.

in speaking about her own experiences, bamby salcedo added, “when i first, you know, got out of rehab, and i was early [in my transition] and entering into social justice work, i remember members of our community, particularly trans women who were leaders and skilled leaders at that time… they would tell me affirming words… like you are a strong person, you’re going to do great things, and you are a leader in our community.” she went on, “i obviously didn’t understand at the time… but just hearing those words of encouragement and really thinking that i was someone was definitely uplifting. [it] supported me to eventually believe that i could do great things. and now i have been a manifestation of that.”

“i have the privilege to be the president and the ceo of the trans latin@ coalition. and my definition of a ceo is ‘community elevated officer’, because i believe that it has been the community who has uplifted me and supported me to be the person that i am today… and so to me, community is integral to my work and into my existence.”

the importance of community uplift was echoed by emmett schelling, “i’ve had to go through a lot as a trans man, single parent, immigrant, and texan. in spite of all the systemic barriers and people that told me i wasn’t worthy, i have built the life every trans person deserves. i am living the life i wanted for myself as a husband, a father, and a houstonian. i could have never done this without the support, friendship, and camaraderie i found in the trans texan community, the community at large, and through the friends and chosen family i’ve made across the movement. when times are tough, we know we can lean on each other.”

he went on to discuss how the community is showing up for trans texans today, saying “we’ve seen an uptick in trans-specific attacks coming from state leadership in texas. this fight has been tough, and is exhausting at times for trans texans. we’ve seen an outpouring of support from allies in texas, and across the world… we’ve seen practical support from our friends across state lines and an outpouring of support from people across the globe through our love letters to trans texans campaign.”

and as sandra pointed out, community isn’t a one way street in which elders give without getting in return, explaining, “i really couldn’t believe [the trans tipping point moment] when it first happened. i could not believe what was going on, because i never thought it would happen that our young trans women, our young queer gay folk, would go in this deep. i watched everyone. i took a little bit from everybody. i really did. a couple of my new, new dear friends, held my hand and pulled me along. i call them the kids.”

but that resilience doesn’t only come from community, it also comes from within. when sandy talked about how she finds that resilience inside herself, she said, “by remembering times i watched some brave, forthright person beat the odds. or by remembering times when i beat the odds. there’s nothing quite as satisfying as saying ‘i’m still here.’”

sandra also spoke of building on the strength of not only trans people, but also the black community, saying, “as a black woman, i live by the rules of my family, my mom, my sisters, there’s a way of living as a black woman that is like no other. you can’t reproduce it. it is what it is, the language is what it is, the lessons are what they are at being a black woman, and that’s where i live. and i live from my humanness, from my family… that’s the lessons i bring to the community, to our community… i bring information from six decades of black women… six decades of black queer folk. i bring that information.”

when musing on the word “resilience”, bamby added, “well, i mean, it was completely honest for me, like i didn’t even know that word existed, right? … the fact that i have been able to overcome many different and horrific experiences right throughout my life… violence in many different forms… it has been my resilience that has allowed me to survive… but also i have had the opportunity to turn those horrific experiences into opportunities, not just for me, but also for members of my community.”

and she tied it all back, saying, “i would say, part of my resilience is also being able to pay it forward, right? because, again, if we think of this full circle moment… i was supported by other trans people. and now i’m able to do work in community, for my community.

but this moment isn’t just about self-reliance, resilience, or trying to foster community. it’s also about trying to foster hope in an increasingly hostile environment.

when speaking about keeping the flame of hope alive, sandy said, “there are two rules to this game: 1) nothing is as bad as it looks. 2) nothing is as good as it looks. each time you figure out how  to deal with an obstacle, each time you encounter a challenge and come out the other side, possibly bruised and abused but still alive, you become a little smarter and a little stronger… this is going to be a  rough time, but we’ll surmount it the same way we surmounted the horrors of the recent past. we learned. we changed the terms of engagement. and we’re still here…and we’re tougher. sometimes, when everything looks hopeless, when all we have is just the instinct to show  up…then just show up. just show up. trust that. after a while, in spite of weariness or  numbness or despair, the next step appears, and then the next. and then you begin to truly understand who you are and what your gift is and why you’re here.”

and when thinking about the concept of hope, bamby reminded us that hope isn’t only an emotion, it can also be an action, saying, “many members of our community do live in hope, right? because hope is what, in my opinion, carries me to a better place… understand that again, there are many members of our community who are doing amazing work, who are organizing, are strategizing, are mobilizing people to understand that we can create a better world and we can create a better future for us, and that’s certainly what we as an organization are doing… and you know, the trans latin@ coalition is an organization that will continue to foster leaders, and we’ll have resources to continue to support our community… despite the oppression that we continue to experience, so there will be a better future for all of us. it’s just a matter of us making sure that we work together to create that.”

and when speaking about what his message would be for trans youth and those who may be older but just starting their journey, ty reminded us, “while short-term struggles are real, having a vision for the future can help sustain motivation. this includes imagining a world where trans people are fully accepted, have equal rights, and live without fear. encouraging others to visualize this future can build a collective sense of purpose.” he went on, talking about taking small steps but having big dreams, saying “it’s important to acknowledge that the journey to change is ongoing. small actions, like advocating for inclusive policies at the local level, organizing support groups, or simply being kind to one another, can add up to create lasting change.”

rodrigo echoed this message, encouraging people, “get involved. don’t get caught in the cycle of either doomscrolling the news or tuning out. both paths are passive, and both leave you disempowered. put yourself in the driver’s seat. call your elected officials, vote in the local races everyone else ignores, run for local office yourself. start a trans book club, mentor a trans youth, volunteer at your lgbtq community center… history is made by those of us who take the initiative to make it happen. you can start right now.”

emmett added a reminder that while the moment may seem scary, “please remember there are thousands of people in texas fighting for your futures, and your present. our community has fought for decades for our right to survive and thrive, and we will continue to get through this and persevere. our existence has always been challenged, but the transcestors whose shoulders we stand upon ensured that we made the progress we have – with far less resources.”

and rodrigo offered a reminder that it’s okay to take a pause, saying, “you have more time than you think. when you’re young, everything feels like a big deal. as you age, you gain perspective. the same is true for your ‘trans age’, or how long since you started living as your authentic self. it can feel like you need to rush. but i encourage everyone to take a deep breath. i took a long time by many standards, yet i’m thriving. there’s no such thing as being behind. no one is in charge of your transition but you.”

and sandy drew a throughline from past to present, reminding us of the progress that we have already made, saying “my generation lived through a period in which trans people made huge gains in public acceptance. we may not live to see gains like that again, but the current crop of trans kids almost certainly will. we’ve taken ten steps forward. now we’re about to be beaten five steps back. but at the end of the day we’re still five steps ahead. that’s how culture works. that’s how progress works… bit by bit, it adds up. twenty years ago there were a few lone trans voices. now there are trans attorneys, trans legislators, trans academics, trans families, trans folks just living their lives. we’re not going back from that.”

she went on to offer her message as a trans elder, saying, “we’re here. we made it. here’s a phone call from the future: we say you’ll survive and thrive and grow to become us, then you’ll surpass us, then you’ll reach back in time and extend a hand to the young ones. across time, trans folk are shouting encouragement. you’ll make it. and you’ll accomplish things we never even dreamed of.”

sandra harkened back to inner strength, reminding us of the miracle of being here in this moment, saying, “i think you learn, you grow, into the strengths of a trans woman. trans women have got to be strong, man. if you have survived this long, your behind was strong. i knew plenty of plenty, plenty of women back in the day who didn’t make it. if i have a message to the youngins, it’s: ‘youngins – stand still.’ pay attention. make sure the decisions you’re making will be your answers in the future. make sure what you’re thinking or what you’re deciding right now, they’re going to add to your future. fun is fun. party is party. i know, and you all gotta have your fun and party, but please be aware, be aware of the journey of getting to your future.”

and bamby reminded us that this is a generational fight, saying, “i think one of the things that it’s important for all of us to recognize is that we have a society and many institutions within our society that have for centuries tried to erase our existence and really negate opportunities for the integration of our community into the tapestry of our society, right? and so this is nothing new for many of us.”

“i would say it’s important for you to understand that we stand on the shoulders of generations of true fighters… and that it is important to understand that you, as an individual, hold power… and also as a community we have power… understand that there’s a whole community that is fighting for you.”

and much like we started, ty left us with a beautiful poem dedicated to trans youth:

you are unfolding,
like a flower that hasn’t yet decided
which direction the sun will call it.

don’t be afraid to explore,
to stretch your wings in a thousand directions,
even those the world hasn’t named yet.

there are paths you haven’t seen,
roads that haven’t been built,
but they will be,

listen closely to yourself,
the quiet voice that whispers
through the noise of others’ expectations,
the one that knows what you need,
even when the world is unsure.

reach out to those who know
the weight of questions and the beauty of becoming.
let their stories mingle with yours,
creating a tapestry of connection.

and remember,
there is no rush to arrive,
no deadline for who you are meant to be.
you are already enough,
just as you are,
and always, always,
you are becoming.

b81a511f-e13a-4eea-b72b-80a0648c7c99,pro,pro-lgbtq candidates prevail in wisconsin’s spring election; voters reject campaigns targeting transgender people,"['pro', 'lgbtq', 'candidate', 'prevail', 'wisconsin', 'spring', 'election', 'voter', 'reject', 'campaign', 'target', 'transgender', 'people']",glaad,none listed,https://glaad.org/pro-lgbtq-candidates-prevail-in-wisconsins-spring-election-voters-reject-campaigns-targeting-transgender-people/,4/2/2025,"voters in wisconsin have elected two candidates who support lgbtq equality in the state’s hotly contested spring election. susan crawford was elevated to the state supreme court and jill underly will return as state superintendent of public instruction.

both candidates defeated opponents and campaign ads that targeted lgbtq people, including a late surge of ads and text messages that baselessly spread fear about transgender people.

the grio also reports that voters in la crosse, wisconsin, made history on tuesday when they elected the city’s first black and first out gay mayor, shaundel washington-spivey.

a high number of voters turned out, with reports that polling places needed to print more ballots to accommodate. the race was billed as a “litmus test,” abc news reported, for voters to “get the chance to weigh in on president donald trump’s agenda,” and express their opinion on the actions of trump’s billionaire donor and “doge” leader elon musk.

musk and related political action committees contributed more than $20million to brad schimel’s campaign, making this the most expensive judicial race in history. musk personally campaigned in wisconsin to offer two voters one million dollars each.

glaad and fair wisconsin had documented the lgbtq and equality records of the supreme court candidates.

crawford’s election secures a pro-equality majority on the court, which could decide on abortion access, voting rights, and accurately representative voting districts for the state legislature.

schimel made several appearances at alliance defending freedom events, lgbtq nation reported. the group was designated an anti-lgbtq+ hate group by the southern poverty law center. schimel aired an anti-trans ad during the campaign attacking crawford for supporting transgender rights.

crawford defeated brad schimel by 10 percent (55% and over 1,300,000 votes / 45% and over 1,050,000 votes). crawford spoke out against musk’s attempts to influence the election. “i’ve got to tell you, as a little girl growing up in chippewa falls, i never could have imagined that i’d be taking on the richest man in the world,” crawford said. “and we won.”

state superintendent of public instruction jill underly beat brittany kinser by five percent (52.9% and over 1,100,000 votes / 47.1% and over 1,000,000 votes). underly spoke in support of lgbtq students during the campaign: “schools should be inclusive spaces where all students feel safe, supported and able to fully participate in extracurricular activities. excluding transgender students from sports not only harms their mental health and well-being but also goes against the principles of fairness and equal opportunity in education.” kinser had campaigned to exclude trans students from school sports, and advocated for private school vouchers that compete for funding with public schools.

“these results are a victory for lgbtq+ rights in wisconsin, and a victory for every wisconsinite as we build a more fair, more inclusive state,” said abigail swetz, executive director of fair wisconsin.

“they show a strong commitment to a wisconsin that lives up to our state motto “forward.” thank you, wisconsin, for voting for equality and against the cynical use of our lgbtq+ community as political pawns.”

“wisconsin voters spoke out on behalf of lgbtq people and for future elections to be fair and free of interference from self-serving billionaires,” glaad president and ceo sarah kate ellis said.

“lies and fearmongering about transgender people do not win elections. wisconsin sent a message of support for the health and safety of each person, and reaffirmed that every vote and every voter matters.”

“susan crawford’s victory is a rejection of extremism and a clear message that wisconsinites want to protect our civil liberties, reproductive rights, and environment,” said milwaukee lgbtq activist and glaad media institute alumni kat klawes.

“voters turned out in historic numbers, so many that some polling places ran out of ballots because they know what’s at stake: the right to control our own bodies, breathe clean air and live in a democracy where every vote truly counts.”

approximately 207,000 lgbtq people live in wisconsin. due to a varying patchwork of local laws, only 21% of wisconsin’s population is protected from discrimination based on gender identity, with 12% partially protected in limited areas such as employment, housing, or public accommodations.

“the identities we hold matter, and while race is a social construct, at the end of the day, who we are in our lived existence needs to be understood, appreciated and respected for what it is,” lacrosse’s newly elected mayor said.

“i just look forward to making sure that we bring this community together across difference, across socio-economic status, across race, gender, sexual orientation, all of those things to ensure that we truly build a community that’s for everybody.”","['voter', 'wisconsin', 'elect', 'candidate', 'support', 'lgbtq', 'equality', 'state', 'hotly', 'contest', 'spring', 'election', 'susan', 'crawford', 'elevate', 'state', 'supreme', 'court', 'jill', 'underly', 'return', 'state', 'superintendent', 'public', 'instruction', 'candidate', 'defeat', 'opponent', 'campaign', 'ad', 'target', 'lgbtq', 'people', 'include', 'late', 'surge', 'ad', 'text', 'message', 'baselessly', 'spread', 'fear', 'transgender', 'people', 'grio', 'report', 'voter', 'la', 'crosse', 'wisconsin', 'history', 'tuesday', 'elect', 'city', 'black', 'gay', 'mayor', 'shaundel', 'washington', 'spivey', 'high', 'number', 'voter', 'turn', 'report', 'polling', 'place', 'need', 'print', 'ballot', 'accommodate', 'race', 'bill', 'litmus', 'test', 'abc', 'news', 'report', 'voter', 'chance', 'weigh', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'agenda', 'express', 'opinion', 'action', 'trump', 'billionaire', 'donor', 'doge', 'leader', 'elon', 'musk', 'musk', 'relate', 'political', 'action', 'committee', 'contribute', 'brad', 'schimel', 'campaign', 'make', 'expensive', 'judicial', 'race', 'history', 'musk', 'personally', 'campaign', 'wisconsin', 'offer', 'voter', 'million', 'dollar', 'glaad', 'fair', 'wisconsin', 'document', 'lgbtq', 'equality', 'record', 'supreme', 'court', 'candidate', 'crawford', 'election', 'secure', 'pro', 'equality', 'majority', 'court', 'decide', 'abortion', 'access', 'voting', 'right', 'accurately', 'representative', 'voting', 'district', 'state', 'legislature', 'schimel', 'appearance', 'alliance', 'defend', 'freedom', 'event', 'lgbtq', 'nation', 'report', 'group', 'designate', 'anti', 'hate', 'group', 'southern', 'poverty', 'law', 'center', 'schimel', 'air', 'anti', 'trans', 'ad', 'campaign', 'attack', 'crawford', 'support', 'transgender', 'right', 'crawford', 'defeat', 'brad', 'schimel', 'percent', 'vote', 'vote', 'crawford', 'speak', 'musk', 'attempt', 'influence', 'election', 'get', 'tell', 'little', 'girl', 'grow', 'chippewa', 'fall', 'imagine', 'take', 'rich', 'man', 'world', 'crawford', 'say', 'win', 'state', 'superintendent', 'public', 'instruction', 'jill', 'underly', 'beat', 'brittany', 'kinser', 'percent', 'vote', 'vote', 'underly', 'speak', 'support', 'lgbtq', 'student', 'campaign', 'school', 'inclusive', 'space', 'student', 'feel', 'safe', 'support', 'able', 'fully', 'participate', 'extracurricular', 'activity', 'exclude', 'transgender', 'student', 'sport', 'harm', 'mental', 'health', 'go', 'principle', 'fairness', 'equal', 'opportunity', 'education', 'kinser', 'campaign', 'exclude', 'trans', 'student', 'school', 'sport', 'advocate', 'private', 'school', 'voucher', 'compete', 'funding', 'public', 'school', 'result', 'victory', 'right', 'wisconsin', 'victory', 'wisconsinite', 'build', 'fair', 'inclusive', 'state', 'say', 'abigail', 'swetz', 'executive', 'director', 'fair', 'wisconsin', 'strong', 'commitment', 'wisconsin', 'live', 'state', 'motto', 'forward', 'thank', 'wisconsin', 'vote', 'equality', 'cynical', 'use', 'community', 'political', 'pawn', 'wisconsin', 'voter', 'speak', 'behalf', 'lgbtq', 'people', 'future', 'election', 'fair', 'free', 'interference', 'self', 'serve', 'billionaire', 'glaad', 'president', 'ceo', 'sarah', 'kate', 'ellis', 'say', 'lie', 'fearmongere', 'transgender', 'people', 'win', 'election', 'wisconsin', 'send', 'message', 'support', 'health', 'safety', 'person', 'reaffirm', 'vote', 'voter', 'matter', 'susan', 'crawford', 'victory', 'rejection', 'extremism', 'clear', 'message', 'wisconsinite', 'want', 'protect', 'civil', 'liberty', 'reproductive', 'right', 'environment', 'say', 'milwaukee', 'lgbtq', 'activist', 'glaad', 'media', 'institute', 'alumnus', 'kat', 'klawes', 'voter', 'turn', 'historic', 'number', 'polling', 'place', 'run', 'ballot', 'know', 'stake', 'right', 'control', 'body', 'breathe', 'clean', 'air', 'live', 'democracy', 'vote', 'truly', 'count', 'approximately', 'lgbtq', 'people', 'live', 'wisconsin', 'vary', 'patchwork', 'local', 'law', 'wisconsin', 'population', 'protect', 'discrimination', 'base', 'gender', 'identity', 'partially', 'protect', 'limited', 'area', 'employment', 'housing', 'public', 'accommodation', 'identity', 'hold', 'matter', 'race', 'social', 'construct', 'end', 'day', 'live', 'existence', 'need', 'understand', 'appreciate', 'respect', 'lacrosse', 'newly', 'elect', 'mayor', 'say', 'look', 'forward', 'make', 'sure', 'bring', 'community', 'difference', 'socio', 'economic', 'status', 'race', 'gender', 'sexual', 'orientation', 'thing', 'ensure', 'truly', 'build', 'community', 'everybody']",
f856da9a-ca07-4411-8f4f-14d4fc948079,pro,meet the 2025 judges powering queer|art’s grants for black trans women visual artists and lesbian filmmakers,"['meet', 'judge', 'power', 'grant', 'black', 'tran', 'woman', 'visual', 'artist', 'lesbian', 'filmmaker']",glaad,tymia ballard,https://glaad.org/meet-the-2025-judges-powering-queer-arts-grants-for-black-trans-women-visual-artists-and-lesbian-filmmakers/,4/7/2025,"in an arts landscape where bipoc, trans, and queer creatives still fight for equitable recognition, queer|art continues to push for it. with the announcement of its 2025 judges for the illuminations grant for black trans women visual artists and the barbara hammer lesbian experimental filmmaking grant, the organization is once again centering those most marginalized not only as recipients, but as decision-makers.

now in its fifth year, the illuminations grant is more than a cash award—it’s a from of affirmation and professional visibility for black trans women visual artists. the 2025 panel features three formidable voices across curatorial, community, and creative spaces: legacy russell, jordyn jay, and lee laa ray guillory. their selection isn’t just symbolic. it’s strategic.

russell, the executive director and chief curator of the kitchen and author of glitch feminism and black meme, has carved out a necessary space at the intersection of race, gender, and digital culture. her work critiques how blackness and queerness are both consumed and constructed online. with her curatorial rigor, russell brings a sharp lens to how we archive, spotlight, and materially support trans and nonbinary artists of color.

joining her is jordyn jay, founder of the black trans femmes in the arts collective (btfa). a staunch advocate for black trans liberation through art, jay understands firsthand the systemic barriers trans femmes face in trying to sustain creative careers. her leadership centers art as a vehicle for both cultural transformation and personal survival.

guillory, whose ritual-based, photo-forward practice is steeped in black mysticism and southern spiritual traditions, rounds out the panel. based in new orleans, she uses self-portraiture and ancestral veneration to explore intersectional identity through an experimental, immersive lens—offering intimate insight into what it means to create from the margins while grounded in heritage.

together, these three judges not only reflect a commitment to black trans brilliance—they are a reimagining of power in action.

the barbara hammer grant, now in its seventh year, mirrors this vision of queer futurity. it supports lesbian experimental filmmakers continuing the legacy of hammer, whose genre-defying work centered desire, death, and queer life in all its complexity. the 2025 judging panel is a powerhouse of interdisciplinary talent: a.k. burns, cheryl dunye, and ela troyano.

dunye, the iconic liberian-american filmmaker behind the watermelon woman—the first feature directed by a black lesbian—has made her mark both in independent film and mainstream tv. her commitment to platforming black queer characters, especially in projects like black is blue, has paved the way for generations of lgbtq+ storytellers to be seen in their full complexity.

burns, is a new york-based visual artist and educator. working across video, installation, sculpture, drawing, and collaboration, burns interrogates systems of value and the body’s role within them—exploring where language meets materiality. her/their work has been exhibited internationally at institutions like the new museum, palais de tokyo, mmk frankfurt, and the harvard art museums. a founding member of w.a.g.e., burns co-created community action center (2010) with a.l. steiner, a queer feminist reimagining of pornographic cinema. recent honors include the berlin prize, guggenheim fellowship, and creative capital award.

troyano, a cuban-born filmmaker rooted in downtown nyc’s avant-garde scene, blurs the boundaries of performance and film. her guerrilla aesthetic, shaped by her latina identity and diasporic roots, challenges colonial narratives and reinserts queer women of color into the cinematic archive.

what makes this year’s lineup of judges revolutionary isn’t just their resumes—it’s the deliberate choice to ensure that those assessing artistic excellence are artists and thinkers who embody it themselves. in a time when institutions still tokenize or sideline queer artists of color, queer|art is doubling down on community-led curation and intersectional leadership.

as applications open through july 2nd, these grants reaffirm what many of us already know: black, trans, lesbian, and queer women have always been visionaries. they don’t just need support. they need platforms. queer|art is making sure they have both.

“i, at first, tried to say, ‘well, maybe it was an accident. maybe it got stuck in a printer.’ that was my first thought,” parker, who requested to go by a pseudonym due to fear of retaliation, tells them. he soon realized that the now-ruined paperwork was everything he owned that legally certified his gender as a trans man. “regardless of what happened, somebody took all of these documents and put them in the envelope and sent them to me that way, fully knowingly.”

making matters worse, parker’s new passport had the wrong gender marker listed on it: a jarring “f” where he had hoped that an “m” would be. he was still convinced that he must have hallucinated what had happened when he telephoned his state representative for help. the lawmaker became silent over the phone as he explained the situation, and when she expressed that she was at a loss for words, the moment’s enormity hit him, and he suddenly started to sob. the deluge of grief startled him: parker has never been prone to tears, and starting testosterone, he says, has made it near-impossible to cry.

speaking over the phone with them from his home, parker says his heart is still racing as he talks about it. he says he feels stuck in place, as if he is sinking lower and lower into the floor. “i feel like i’m losing it,” he says. “i keep having moments where i think, ‘someone couldn’t have done that. someone wouldn’t do that. then i look at it and i say, ‘no, i am looking at exactly what i’m looking at. one plus one equals two.’”

these emotions are sadly familiar for many trans americans who have been denied corrected passports since president donald trump’s second inauguration in january. just one day after trump resumed office, he issued an executive order directing the state department to halt all updates to gender markers on u.s. passports and discontinue the gender-neutral “x” designation. following that guidance, numerous trans, nonbinary, and intersex people have reported receiving inaccurate gender markers on their passports, including euphoria actress hunter schafer, who called the situation a “harsh reality check” in a since-deleted tiktok video.

“you know how they say that when a child is in danger, a mom could lift a bus off them, from the force of adrenaline? i feel like right now i’m tasked with lifting the entire white house and everyone in it off of my daughter.”

the american civil liberties union (aclu) is currently suing the trump administration on behalf of seven plaintiffs who were all denied passports that reflect their lived identities as trans people. in a statement, the aclu describes the refusal of accurate documentation as a “chaotic policy clearly motivated by animus that serves zero public interest” and a “blatant effort to violate their privacy and deny [trans people] their freedom to be themselves.”

as the aclu’s lawsuit moves through the courts, trans people and their loved ones say that the inability to get accurate passports has destabilized their lives and made their futures uncertain. in states that place burdensome restrictions on updating birth certificates, driver’s licenses, and state ids, applying for a corrected passport has, for many, served as the safer and easier alternative. in 2021, the biden administration announced that it would no longer require trans people to provide medical documentation certifying their transition before being granted a corrected passport. under biden, in 2021, the state department said that it would begin issuing “x” gender markers following a years-long lawsuit from intersex activist dana zzyym.

lacking access to those documents, as sources tell them, makes it harder for trans people to move through the world without issue. after being sent an inaccurate passport in february, 29-year-old lily powers said that she worries about “sticking out like a sore thumb” while passing through airport security. “i don’t want someone to see me when i’m traveling and have a reason to question me,” she said. “for me to have an ‘m’ on my passport puts me in danger immediately.”

powers had been crossing her fingers, hoping that she might somehow slip through the cracks of the new administration’s policies. she filed her application for a corrected passport at the beginning of january, and a few days before trump’s inauguration, powers called the u.s. passport office and told them that she planned to visit a friend in canada, hoping that her correction would then be expedited. but when she received an inaccurate passport three weeks later, powers also received a notice from the bureau of consular affairs detailing why she had received an “m” on her documents. on the sheet, an agent had circled two phrases: “sex” and “to match our records.”

“t felt like i’ve been let down by my government. it felt like i’d been let down by the american people. it felt like i was being rejected and ostracized by society at large for simply trying to exist.”

before this incident, powers said that transitioning had been a wholly positive experience. she had been severely depressed before coming out as a trans woman, and she credits her transition with saving her life. “i’m happier than i’ve ever been because i’ve chosen to live and be happy,” powers says. “as someone who’s a little more than three and a half years into her transition, it’s really, really frustrating to be slapped in the face with this.”

although powers said that she was just beginning the long journey of updating her documents, what concerns eris discordia montano, 53, is that the vast majority of her other identification accurately reflects her gender. montano has an “f” on her driver’s license and in the national social security database. if someone were to question why her documents don’t match, such as a tsa agent or even a potential employer, montano said that the answer could prove a problem for her. “it's a terrible, terrifying feeling,” she tells them.

when the “m” passport was mailed to her ex-wife’s house in february, montano flashed back to the despair she felt after the 2024 presidential election: the knowledge that, while she would survive the casual brutality of the next four years, she didn’t want to be forced to do so. “it felt like i’ve been let down by my government,” montano says. “it felt like i’d been let down by the american people. it felt like i was being rejected and ostracized by society at large for simply trying to exist.”

for parents with trans kids, restricting the ability to apply for corrected passports makes it more difficult for them to plan for worst-case scenarios. in the early days of his new term, trump enacted a series of orders targeting both trans youth and adults, including threatening health practitioners that provide gender-affirming care to minors with the loss of federal funding and limiting sports participation for trans student athletes. his administration is also punishing schools that permit trans students to “socially transition” on campus and erasing federal resources geared toward the lgbtq+ community, such as removing mentions of queer youth from stopbullying.gov

fearing how bad things might get under another trump presidency, lisa suhay, 59, paid what she describes as “exorbitant” fees to expedite her 19-year-old daughter mellow’s first-ever passport. suhay hoped to be able to rush the application through, but the day trump’s directive hit, they had to make a tough choice: would they change the application to an “m” marker or risk the passport being rejected altogether? fearing that a lack of documentation could jeopardize the possibility of fleeing the country in an emergency, they decided to play it safe with a male passport.

while mellow says that it’s “disturbing” that she has to be legally misgendered for her own safety, her mother notes that they are in uncharted waters. she says that she has called numerous attorneys, and no one can give her family a clear answer as to how they should navigate the “horrific legal situation” the country finds itself in. suhay says that, some days, it feels like they’re caught in a trap. “you know how they say that when a child is in danger, a mom could lift a bus off them, from the force of adrenaline?” she tells them. “i feel like right now i’m tasked with lifting the entire white house and everyone in it off of my daughter.”

those affected by trump’s new passport policies said they are attempting to remain resilient and keep up the fight, but many admit that the past few weeks have been a low point. fay mortenson, 50, tells them that she “dropped to the floor sobbing” after getting her 16-year-old son’s passport back with an “f” on it. when she saw in the state department’s online database in february that the passport had been “approved,” mortenson prayed that, for some reason, they had been spared the agonies others were suffering. she saw social media posts from trans people who had gotten their passports back damaged or had their applications put on hold, but just maybe, they got lucky. “i had this tiny sliver of hope,” she tells them, “and then it was just gone.”

mortenson, who asked to use a pseudonym for this story, says she has been attending rallies and vigils in her home state to regain her optimism, but she’s finding it tough. she cycles through so many emotions throughout her day — rage, sadness, fear, and loneliness — but ultimately, she says she feels disoriented, as if the world around her is “in this free fall and there’s nobody to catch us right now.”

“people are just trying to live their lives,” she says. “it is in no way a threat to anyone or anything for someone to have the correct documents. it’s just cruel.”","['parker', 'get', 'new',

9653257e-88ee-4836-8e26-b4704a16f9c0,pro,you are not dreaming: senate dems actually banded together to block an anti-trans sports ban,"['dream', 'senate', 'dem', 'actually', 'band', 'block', 'anti', 'trans', 'sport', 'ban']",them,abby monteil,https://www.them.us/story/senate-democrats-block-anti-trans-sports-ban-congress-floor-debate,3/4/2025,"senate democrats voted unanimously on monday to block a republican-led bill that would have banned federally funded schools from allowing trans athletes to compete in women’s sports.

the party line vote was 51-45, with zero democrats voting in favor. four senators did not vote: republican senators shelley moore (wv) and cynthia lummis (wy) and democratic senators elissa slotkin (mi) and peter welch (vt). although the republican party has a majority in the senate with 53 seats, the bill — deceitfully titled the “protection of women and girls in sports act” — needed seven democratic votes to reach the 60-vote threshold required for it to advance.

the republican-majority house passed their own version of the bill in january with a 218-206 vote. two house democrats — texas representatives henry cuellar and vincente gonzalez — voted in favor of the anti-trans measure, while one democrat (north carolina rep. donald g. davis) voted “present.”

“what republicans are doing today is inventing a problem to stir up a culture war and divide people against each other,” hawaii democrat sen. brian schatz said on the floor on monday, per the hill.

“i, for one, trust our states, our leagues, our localities to make these decisions [about women’s sports] without interference from congress or the president,” wisconsin democratic senator tammy baldwin said on the floor, per the washington post.

the bill, sponsored in the senate by alabama republican senator tommy tuberville, sought to ban trans girls and women from competing in women’s sports at public k-12 schools and universities by amending title ix, the federal civil rights law that prohibits sex discrimination in educational institutions. if signed into law, the bill would have changed the statute of title ix to explicitly exclude transgender people from a federal civil rights law. the bill narrowly and falsely defines sex as “based solely on a person’s reproductive biology and genetics at birth.”

conversely, the biden administration’s title ix regulations allowed lgbtq+ students to fight discrimination without a lawsuit. instead, they could file a complaint with the education department’s office of civil rights.

the legislation also would have codified into law donald trump’s february executive order derisively titled “keeping men out of women’s sports,” which directed federal agencies to withdraw funding from educational programs that allow trans girls to play on teams that align with their gender. although the executive order doesn’t have the power to immediately ban trans women and girls from sports across the country, the trump administration has already attempted to use it to intimidate states into bending to the administration’s will. last week, for instance, the president threatened to cut maine’s federal funding if state governor janet mills did not comply with the order.

anti-trans fearmongering was a major talking point for republicans during the 2024 election cycle, particularly when it came to demonizing trans women’s inclusion in sports. an october new york times analysis of adimpact data found that republicans had spent over $65 million on anti-trans campaign ads since the beginning of august and the trump campaign had spent $15.5 million on anti-trans ads in just three weeks.

democrats have come under criticism in recent months, including from this publication, for their responses to right-wing anti-trans attacks. during the last election cycle, for instance, democratic candidates like texas rep. colin allred and ohio sen. sherrod brown faced pushback after responding to republican anti-trans attack ads with anti-trans talking points of their own. shortly after trump’s presidential victory in november, democratic new york rep. tom suozzi told the new york times that the party must “stop pandering to the far left” on trans rights, sparking outrage from lgbtq+ advocates. and even as south carolina republican rep. nancy mace spent the beginning of 2025 hurling anti-trans slurs at delaware rep. sarah mcbride, the first out trans woman to serve in congress, democrats have largely remained silent. suffice it to say, holding the line against republicans’ latest anti-trans attacks is a nice change of pace.

iris turmelle, one of the plaintiffs now in high school, told them in a statement last august that her goal is simply to compete alongside her peers.
“a whole host of overpaid consultants and talking heads told [democrats] not to do the right thing, and they still chose to do the right thing, so i’d even go a step further and encourage people to contact senators who opposed this measure (sb 9) and thank them for standing by trans people and our families,” aclu communications strategist gillian branstetter wrote in a march 3 bluesky post.

as many experts and trans athletes have pointed out, athletic ability among trans people varies as much as it does for cis people. meanwhile, research has found that trans women who undergo testosterone suppression through gender-affirming care have no clear biological advantages over cis women in elite sports. according to an april 2024 study funded in part by the international olympic committee, trans women athletes may indeed have several physical disadvantages when competing with cisgender women.

for all that their existence has been politicized, trans athletes represent a very small percentage of all student-athletes. in december, ncaa president charlie baker told a senate panel that out of the over 510,000 ncaa athletes, fewer than 10 are transgender to his knowledge.","['senate', 'democrats', 'vote', 'unanimously', 'monday', 'block', 'republican', 'lead', 'bill', 'ban', 'federally',

d4e79ee1-4279-47af-a234-2479acb089c3,pro,federal judge extends block on trump’s trans youth healthcare executive order,"['federal', 'judge', 'extend', 'block', 'trump', 'trans', 'youth', 'healthcare', 'executive', 'order']",them,james factora,https://www.them.us/story/federal-judge-extends-block-trump-trans-youth-healthcare-executive-order,3/5/2025,"a federal judge on tuesday extended a nationwide block on the enforcement of a trump administration executive order that seeks to block trans youth ages 19 and under from accessing gender-affirming care by withholding federal funding to hospitals that provide it.

tuesday’s ruling by u.s. district court judge brendan a. hurson in pflag v. trump — a case brought by two lgbtq+ advocacy groups, two trans young adults, and five trans adolescents and their families — means that the executive order will not be enforced as the litigation continues to play out. hurson previously issued a temporary restraining order against the order in february, which blocked implementation of the order for two weeks before being extended to march 5.

president trump initially issued the executive order titled “protecting children from chemical and surgical mutilation” on january 28. the aclu, lambda legal, and several other organizations, including pflag and glma, subsequently filed a lawsuit on behalf of a group of young trans people and their families on february 4, arguing that the order is unconstitutional, and that the executive branch does not have the authority to control hospital funding in such a way without going through congress. even so, hospitals around the country preemptively cancelled appointments for gender-affirming care for trans youth.

the decision comes days after a federal judge in seattle similarly granted an injunction against the executive order after previously granting a temporary restraining order. that injunction, however, applied only in washington, oregon, minnesota, and colorado, whose attorneys general had sued the trump administration over the order.

new york state ag letitia james tells hospitals to continue providing gender-affirming care
some u.s. healthcare providers have stopped offering gender-affirming care to minors even though trump’s sweeping anti-trans executive order has not changed the legality of such care.
in a press release from the aclu of maryland, alex sheldon, the executive director of glma, the largest association of lgbtq+ and allied health professionals, called the tuesday ruling “a crucial step in resisting the extremist agenda of the trump administration and reaffirming that trans and non-binary people deserve dignity, respect, and access to the health care they need.”

“this administration has tried to bully providers into abandoning their ethical obligations, but we will not back down,” they said. “we will continue to fight for health professionals’ freedom to do their jobs based on medical expertise — not political ideology — and for the right of every patient to receive care free from discrimination and fear.”

joshua block, senior staff attorney for the aclu’s lgbtq & hiv project, said in the press release that the decision “provides relief to transgender young people, their families, and their medical providers who have been thrown into chaos by this administration.”

“this order from president trump is a direct effort to threaten the well-being of transgender people while denying them equal protection under the law, enacted by coercing doctors to follow trump’s own ideology rather than their best medical judgment,” he said. “as judge hurson has said himself, it is hard to fathom a form of discrimination more nefarious than that which pretends the group of people being targeted doesn’t even exist.”","['federal', 'judge', 'tuesday', 'extend', 'nationwide', 'block', 'enforcement', 'trump', 'administration', 'executive', 'order', 'seek', 'block', 'trans', 'youth', 'age', 'access', 'gender', 'affirm', 'care', 'withhold', 'federal', 'funding', 'hospital', 'provide', 'tuesday', 'ruling', 'district', 'court', 'judge', 'brendan', 'hurson', 'pflag', 'trump', 'case', 'bring', 'advocacy', 'group', 'trans', 'young', 'adult', 'trans', 'adolescent', 'family', 'mean', 'executive', 'order', 'enforce', 'litigation', 'continue', 'play', 'hurson', 'previously', 'issue', 'temporary', 'restraining', 'order', 'order', 'february', 'block', 'implementation', 'order', 'week', 'extend', 'march', 'president', 'trump', 'initially', 'issue', 'executive', 'order', 'title', 'protect', 'child', 'chemical', 'surgical', 'mutilation', 'january', 'aclu', 'lambda', 'legal', 'organization', 'include', 'pflag', 'glma', 'subsequently', 'file', 'lawsuit', 'behalf', 'group', 'young', 'trans', 'people', 'family', 'february', 'argue', 'order', 'unconstitutional', 'executive', 'branch', 'authority', 'control', 'hospital', 'funding', 'way', 'go', 'congress', 'hospital', 'country', 'preemptively', 'cancel', 'appointment', 'gender', 'affirm', 'care', 'tran', 'youth', 'decision', 'come', 'day', 'federal', 'judge', 'seattle', 'similarly', 'grant', 'injunction', 'executive', 'order', 'previously', 'grant', 'temporary', 'restraining', 'order', 'injunction', 'apply', 'washington', 'oregon', 'minnesota', 'colorado', 'attorney', 'general', 'sue', 'trump', 'administration', 'order', 'people', 'gather', 'defend', 'trans', 'people', 'right', 'new', 'york', 'city', 'february', 'hundred', 'people', 'protest', 'new', 'york', 'february', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'executive', 'order', 'sign', 'january', 'restrict', 'gender', 'transition', 'procedure', 'people', 'age', 'report', 'local', 'hospital', 'group', 'cancel', 'appointment', 'young', 'people', 'response', 'photo', 'charly', 'triballeau', 'afp', 'photo', 'charly', 'triballeau', 'afp', 'getty', 'image', 'new', 'york', 'state', 'ag', 'letitia', 'james', 'tell', 'hospital', 'continue', 'provide', 'gender', 'affirm', 'care', 'healthcare', 'provider', 'stop', 'offer', 'gender', 'affirm', 'care', 'minor', 'trump', 'sweep', 'anti', 'trans', 'executive', 'order', 'change', 'legality', 'care', 'press', 'release', 'aclu', 'maryland', 'alex', 'sheldon', 'executive', 'director', 'glma', 'large', 'association', 'ally', 'health', 'professional', 'call', 'tuesday', 'ruling', 'crucial', 'step', 'resist', 'extremist', 'agenda', 'trump', 'administration', 'reaffirm', 'trans', 'non', 'binary', 'people', 'deserve', 'dignity', 'respect', 'access', 'health', 'care', 'need', 'administration', 'try', 'bully', 'provider', 'abandon', 'ethical', 'obligation', 'say', 'continue', 'fight', 'health', 'professional', 'freedom', 'job', 'base', 'medical', 'expertise', 'political', 'ideology', 'right', 'patient', 'receive', 'care', 'free', 'discrimination', 'fear', 'joshua', 'block', 'senior', 'staff', 'attorney', 'aclu', 'lgbtq', 'hiv', 'project', 'say', 'press', 'release', 'decision', 'provide', 'relief', 'transgender', 'young', 'people', 'family', 'medical', 'provider', 'throw', 'chaos', 'administration', 'order', 'president', 'trump', 'direct', 'effort', 'threaten', 'transgender', 'people', 'deny', 'equal', 'protection', 'law', 'enact', 'coerce', 'doctor', 'follow', 'trump', 'ideology', 'good', 'medical', 'judgment', 'say', 'judge', 'hurson', 'say', 'hard', 'fathom', 'form', 'discrimination', 'nefarious', 'pretend', 'group', 'people', 'target', 'exist']",
20228915-c71f-4a08-af40-46ad5ffa4cd0,pro,"gavin newsom, california’s democratic governor, says trans women playing sports is “deeply unfair”","['gavin', 'newsom', 'california', 'democratic', 'governor', 'say', 'trans', 'woman', 'play', 'sport', 'deeply', 'unfair']",them,mathew rodriguez,https://www.them.us/story/gavin-newsom-charlie-kirk-trans-women-sports-policy-position-fairness,3/6/2025,"california governor gavin newsom repeatedly agreed with maga pundit and turning point usa co-founder charlie kirk on the issue of trans people in sports in an interview on the debut episode of newsom’s new podcast, which premiered thursday march 6.

while speaking to kirk for the first episode of this is gavin newsom, the democratic politican sought advice from the conservative pundit about reaching out to young voters, given that republicans made steep inroads with the youth vote in the 2024 election. kirk responded that newsom and the democrats must “get better ideas” but also “run to the middle,” which is when the right-wing political activist brought up the issue of trans athletes in sports.

“you right now should come out and be like, ‘the young man that’s about to win the state championship in the long jump in female sports, that shouldn’t happen,” kirk said. “you as the governor should step up and say no.”

after this more oblique reference, kirk specifically called out the trans athlete — who has become a target for tabloids and right-wing publications — by name, then asked whether newsom would consider coming out against trans athletes in sports.

“i think it’s an issue of fairness, i completely agree with you on that. it is an issue of fairness — it’s deeply unfair,” newsom said. “i am not wrestling with the fairness issue. i totally agree with you.”

apparently sensing that he has an opportunity to sway the governor, kirk then appealed to newsom as the father of two daughters, while noting that kirk is a father to a daughter himself.

“i revere sports, so the issue of fairness is completely legit,” newsom said.

despite newsom’s claim that fairness concerns are “completely legit,”, several studies maintain that there is no scientific basis for banning trans women from playing sports with cis women and that trans women may, in fact, face several competitive disadvantages in competition against cis women.

newsom went on to say that republicans were “able to weaponize that issue” in the recent election cycle, but eventually walked even that mild criticism back when kirk called it out for being too harsh.

“not weaponize,” kirk said. “shine a light on.”

“highlight in a way,” newsom agreed.

while newsom said many times that he agrees with kirk on the issue,, he did ask kirk about the human side of the issue. referring to the trans community as “these poor people,” newsom said, “these poor people are more likely to commit suicide, have anxiety and depression. the way people talk down to vulnerable communities is an issue that i have a hard time with, as well. so both things i can hold in my hand. how can we address this issue with the kind of decency that i think is inherent in you, but not always expressed on the issue?”

kirk, however, sidestepped this question, calling trans athletes in sports an “80/20 issue” that democrats are losing.

maine’s governor stood up to trump’s anti-trans order. the state is now under investigation
“see you in court,” maine governor janet mills said after trump threatened to cut the state’s federal funding if it didn’t comply with his executive order attempting to ban trans girls and women from sports.
“you guys are giving us an 80/20 issue that is just permeating the country, and is such an affront to our senses,” kirk said. the right-wing pundit went on to deride democrats who banned together to oppose a republican-led bill in the united states senate that would have banned schools receiving federal funding from allowing trans athletes to compete in women’s sports.

throughout the interview, newsom tried to bring up his advocacy for the lgbtq+ community, including when he defied federal law to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples in california. however, he also allowed kirk to essentially steamroll him several times on key conservative issues, especially pertaining to college students and college campuses.

“you go to caltech to study computer engineering and applied ai, next thing you know, you’re crushing it, right?” kirk said. “you go to cal to study north african lesbian poetry …”

“is that an actual degree?” newsom responded.

“you tell me, governor,” kirk said, prompting newsom to laugh. “the fact that you don’t know … it should be like, ‘no way!’ the fact that it’s a ‘maybe,’ we’ve got some problems.”

newsom’s comments come less than two weeks after maine governor janet mills defied president trump on his executive order banning trans girls from playing the sport that matches their gender. when trump tried to intimidate mills at a republican governors association speech by threatening to revoke federal funding from maine, mills responded that the state would be complying with state and federal law, telling the president,“see you in court.”","['california', 'governor', 'gavin', 'newsom', 'repeatedly', 'agree', 'maga', 'pundit', 'turn', 'point', 'usa', 'co', 'founder', 'charlie', 'kirk', 'issue', 'trans', 'people', 'sport', 'interview', 'debut', 'episode', 'newsom', 'new', 'podcast', 'premiere', 'thursday', 'march', 'speak', 'kirk', 'episode', 'gavin', 'newsom', 'democratic', 'politican', 'seek', 'advice', 'conservative', 'pundit', 'reach', 'young', 'voter', 'give', 'republicans', 'steep', 'inroad', 'youth', 'vote', 'election', 'kirk', 'respond', 'newsom', 'democrats', 'well', 'idea', 'run', 'middle', 'right', 'wing', 'political', 'activist', 'bring', 'issue', 'trans', 'athlete', 'sport', 'right', 'come', 'like', 'young', 'man', 'win', 'state', 'championship', 'long', 'jump', 'female', 'sport', 'happen', 'kirk', 'say', 'governor', 'step', 'oblique', 'reference', 'kirk', 'specifically', 'call', 'trans', 'athlete', 'target', 'tabloid', 'right', 'wing', 'publication', 'ask', 'newsom', 'consider', 'come', 'trans', 'athlete', 'sport', 'think', 'issue', 'fairness', 'completely', 'agree', 'issue', 'fairness', 'deeply', 'unfair', 'newsom', 'say', 'wrestle', 'fairness', 'issue', 'totally', 'agree', 'apparently', 'sense', 'opportunity', 'sway', 'governor', 'kirk', 'appeal', 'newsom', 'father', 'daughter', 'note', 'kirk', 'father', 'daughter', 'revere', 'sport', 'issue', 'fairness', 'completely', 'legit', 'newsom', 'say', 'despite', 'newsom', 'claim', 'fairness', 'concern', 'completely', 'legit', 'study', 'maintain', 'scientific', 'basis', 'ban', 'tran', 'woman', 'play', 'sport', 'cis', 'woman', 'trans', 'woman', 'fact', 'face', 'competitive', 'disadvantage', 'competition', 'cis', 'woman', 'newsom', 'go', 'republicans', 'able', 'weaponize', 'issue', 'recent', 'election', 'cycle', 'eventually', 'walk', 'mild', 'criticism', 'kirk', 'call', 'harsh', 'weaponize', 'kirk', 'say', 'shine', 'light', 'highlight', 'way', 'newsom', 'agree', 'newsom', 'say', 'time', 'agree', 'kirk', 'issue', 'ask', 'kirk', 'human', 'issue', 'refer', 'trans', 'community', 'poor', 'people', 'newsom', 'say', 'poor', 'people', 'likely', 'commit', 'suicide', 'anxiety', 'depression', 'way', 'people', 'talk', 'vulnerable', 'community', 'issue', 'hard', 'time', 'thing', 'hold', 'hand', 'address', 'issue', 'kind', 'decency', 'think', 'inherent', 'express', 'issue', 'kirk', 'sidestep', 'question', 'call', 'trans', 'athlete', 'sport', 'issue', 'democrats', 'lose', 'maine', 'governor', 'stand', 'trump', 'anti', 'trans', 'order', 'state', 'investigation', 'court', 'maine', 'governor', 'janet', 'mill', 'say', 'trump', 'threaten', 'cut', 'state', 'federal', 'funding', 'comply', 'executive', 'order', 'attempt', 'ban', 'trans', 'girl', 'woman', 'sport', 'guy', 'give', 'issue', 'permeate', 'country', 'affront', 'sense', 'kirk', 'say', 'right', 'wing', 'pundit', 'go', 'deride', 'democrat', 'ban', 'oppose', 'republican', 'lead', 'bill', 'united', 'states', 'senate', 'ban', 'school', 'receive', 'federal', 'funding', 'allow', 'trans', 'athlete', 'compete', 'woman', 'sport', 'interview', 'newsom', 'try', 'bring', 'advocacy', 'community', 'include', 'defy', 'federal', 'law', 'issue', 'marriage', 'license', 'sex', 'couple', 'california', 'allow', 'kirk', 'essentially', 'steamroll', 'time', 'key', 'conservative', 'issue', 'especially', 'pertain', 'college', 'student', 'college', 'campus', 'caltech', 'study', 'computer', 'engineering', 'apply', 'ai', 'thing', 'know', 'crush', 'right', 'kirk', 'say', 'cal', 'study', 'north', 'african', 'lesbian', 'poetry', 'actual', 'degree', 'newsom', 'respond', 'tell', 'governor', 'kirk', 'say', 'prompt', 'newsom', 'laugh', 'fact', 'know', 'like', 'way', 'fact', 'maybe', 'get', 'problem', 'newsom', 'comment', 'come', 'week', 'maine', 'governor', 'janet', 'mills', 'defy', 'president', 'trump', 'executive', 'order', 'ban', 'trans', 'girl', 'play', 'sport', 'match', 'gender', 'trump', 'try', 'intimidate', 'mill', 'republican', 'governor', 'association', 'speech', 'threaten', 'revoke', 'federal', 'funding', 'maine', 'mill', 'respond', 'state', 'comply', 'state', 'federal', 'law', 'tell', 'court']",
41479f54-8f2f-4b44-a421-0fb1a896a758,pro,the vatican may have ever so slightly softened its stance on trans people,"['vatican', 'slightly', 'soften', 'stance', 'trans', 'people']",them,samantha riedel,https://www.them.us/story/vatican-transgender-stance,3/6/2025,"the vatican may have ever so slightly softened its stance on trans people this past month, allowing the possibility of supporting a person’s transition in “exceptional circumstances” while upholding its stance against so-called “gender ideology.”

as cnn reported this week, vatican officials released the text of a speech given by doctrine chief cardinal victor manuel fernández at a theological conference in cologne in february. in his speech, fernández acknowledged that gender dysphoria “manifests itself even from childhood” and may cause “deep suffering.”

“[t]here are cases outside the norm, such as strong dysphorias that can lead to an unbearable existence or even suicide. these exceptional situations must be evaluated with great care,” fernández told the conference.

but fernández’s support only went so far. the cardinal also warned that medically transitioning represents “the right to a change of identity, the desire to be a different person,” which he deemed unacceptable. that degree of self-determination, he said, was a “claim to omnipotence” by trans people who wish to “create an alternative reality at will.”

fernández’s comments, though they appear to incrementally soften the catholic church’s stance on trans identities, echo similar comments made by pope francis in the past. francis has been a frequently confounding presence in the vatican, regularly meeting for meals with a group of trans women while reportedly decrying homosexuality within the church and referring to “gender ideology” as a threat to religious order. he famously compared trans people to nuclear weapons in 2015, and said that medical transition is “a new sin, that against god the creator.”

but francis has also appeared to split hairs between the material treatment of trans people individually and his conception of so-called “gender ideology.” the pope told a catholic activist in 2024 that while trans people “must be accepted and integrated into society,” he considers “gender ideology” to be a secular philosophy that “nullifies differences” between genders, rendering “everyone equal without respect for personal history.”

at time of writing, francis has been hospitalized for nearly three weeks with double pneumonia. the group of trans women with whom francis meets for pasta told the washington post this week that they are praying for his recovery.

“in this covid period, it was important that pope francis got inside the mind of transgender women, in the mind of the human beings that we are, and started to treat us like human beings,” carla segovia told the post, adding that she wanted to “transmit to him our strength, the same thing that he brought to us in the difficult time of the pandemic. we want to inoculate him with this strength that is so crucial — the fact that you need to fight for your life.”","['vatican', 'slightly', 'soften', 'stance', 'trans', 'people', 'past', 'month', 'allow', 'possibility', 'support', 'person', 'transition', 'exceptional', 'circumstance', 'uphold', 'stance', 'call', 'gender', 'ideology', 'cnn', 'report', 'week', 'vatican', 'official', 'release', 'text', 'speech', 'give', 'doctrine', 'chief', 'cardinal', 'victor', 'manuel', 'fernández', 'theological', 'conference', 'cologne', 'february', 'speech', 'fernández', 'acknowledge', 'gender', 'dysphoria', 'manifest', 'childhood', 'cause', 'deep', 'suffering', 'case', 'outside', 'norm', 'strong', 'dysphoria', 'lead', 'unbearable', 'existence', 'suicide', 'exceptional', 'situation', 'evaluate', 'great', 'care', 'fernández', 'tell', 'conference', 'fernández', 'support', 'go', 'far', 'cardinal', 'warn', 'medically', 'transition', 'represent', 'right', 'change', 'identity', 'desire', 'different', 'person', 'deem', 'unacceptable', 'degree', 'self', 'determination', 'say', 'claim', 'omnipotence', 'trans', 'people', 'wish', 'create', 'alternative', 'reality', 'fernández', 'comment', 'appear', 'incrementally', 'soften', 'catholic', 'church', 'stance', 'trans', 'identity', 'echo', 'similar', 'comment', 'pope', 'francis', 'past', 'francis', 'frequently', 'confound', 'presence', 'vatican', 'regularly', 'meet', 'meal', 'group', 'trans', 'woman', 'reportedly', 'decry', 'homosexuality', 'church', 'refer', 'gender', 'ideology', 'threat', 'religious', 'order', 'famously', 'compare', 'tran', 'people', 'nuclear', 'weapon', 'say', 'medical', 'transition', 'new', 'sin', 'god', 'creator', 'francis', 'appear', 'split', 'hair', 'material', 'treatment', 'trans', 'people', 'individually', 'conception', 'call', 'gender', 'ideology', 'pope', 'tell', 'catholic', 'activist', 'trans', 'people', 'accept', 'integrate', 'society', 'consider', 'gender', 'ideology', 'secular', 'philosophy', 'nullifie', 'difference', 'gender', 'render', 'equal', 'respect', 'personal', 'history', 'time', 'writing', 'francis', 'hospitalize', 'nearly', 'week', 'double', 'pneumonia', 'group', 'trans', 'woman', 'francis', 'meet', 'pasta', 'tell', 'washington', 'post', 'week', 'pray', 'recovery', 'covid', 'period', 'important', 'pope', 'francis', 'get', 'inside', 'mind', 'transgender', 'woman', 'mind', 'human', 'being', 'start', 'treat', 'like', 'human', 'being', 'carla', 'segovia', 'tell', 'post', 'add', 'want', 'transmit', 'strength', 'thing', 'bring', 'difficult', 'time', 'pandemic', 'want', 'inoculate', 'strength', 'crucial', 'fact', 'need', 'fight', 'life']",

administration officials first announced on february 21 that they would investigate maine’s compliance with title ix civil rights regulations, following a heated exchange between trump and maine gov. janet mills at a national governors association gathering. at the event, mills publicly refused to comply with trump’s executive order against trans youth in school sports, which threatens to withdraw federal funding from states that maintain inclusive policies.

only four days later, in a document later obtained by abc affiliate wmtw, the department of health and human services (hhs) notified mills and maine attorney general aaron frey that the state department of education was found to have violated title ix.

the document — signed by anthony archeval, acting director of the office of civil rights (ocr) — claims that the maine department of education currently “violates title ix by denying female student athletes in the state of maine an equal opportunity to participate in” school athletics, because of the possible inclusion of trans girls.

offering “additional opportunity” for people who “assert a ‘gender identity’ different from their sex, constitutes discrimination on the basis of gender identity, against students who identify as their sex,” the document continues. archeval’s letter also explicitly casts aside discussion of trans boys, asserting that cis boys “are not subject to heightened safety or competitive concerns” in sports.

absent from the document is any record of an official investigation, which would usually include interviewing witnesses and collecting evidence over the course of weeks or months. instead, archeval’s letter referenced two news stories alleging that two trans girls have participated in high school sports in maine. one of the stories — published on outkick, a right-wing sports website known for negative coverage of trans athletes — focused on allegations that a trans girl placed third and fourth in competitive skiing events. the other was based on a facebook post last month by maine republican rep. laurel libby, in which libby posted photos of a high schooler she claimed was trans and had recently won a track meet.

the identity of that student has not been publicly confirmed, though the named high school temporarily increased security in the days after libby’s post. libby has since been censured by the state house of representatives, but refused to apologize this week.

danna hayes, a spokesperson for a.g. frey’s office, told the portland press herald that “there is no pending litigation” against the state regarding title ix. hayes also told the bangor daily news that “[n]o action has been taken yet” by the federal government in regards to stripping funding from the state department of education, as trump threatened. mills’ office declined to comment to reporters this week, directing press to the governor’s previous statement, in which she said “the outcome of this politically directed investigation is all but predetermined.”

since taking office in january, trump has sought to eliminate civil rights for trans people in numerous areas, particularly the rights of trans minors to participate in school sports and receive gender-affirming medical care. in his address to congress earlier this week, trump repeatedly denigrated and misgendered trans people of all ages, vowing that “wokeness is dead” in the u.s. under his administration.","['trump', 'administration', 'declare', 'state', 'maine', 'violate', 'federal', 'law', 'allow', 'transgender', 'cisgender', 'girl', 'play', 'sport', 'league', 'follow', 'investigation', 'last', 'week', 'reportedly', 'include', 'contact', 'state', 'administrator', 'administration', 'official', 'announce', 'february', 'investigate', 'maine', 'compliance', 'title', 'ix', 'civil', 'right', 'regulation', 'follow', 'heated', 'exchange', 'trump', 'maine', 'gov', 'janet', 'mill', 'national', 'governor', 'association', 'gathering', 'event', 'mill', 'publicly', 'refuse', 'comply', 'trump', 'executive', 'order', 'trans', 'youth', 'school', 'sport', 'threaten', 'withdraw', 'federal', 'funding', 'state', 'maintain', 'inclusive', 'policy', 'day', 'later', 'document', 'later', 'obtain', 'abc', 'affiliate', 'wmtw', 'department', 'health', 'human', 'service', 'hhs', 'notify', 'mill', 'maine', 'attorney', 'general', 'aaron', 'frey', 'state', 'department', 'education', 'find', 'violate', 'title', 'ix', 'document', 'sign', 'anthony', 'archeval', 'acting', 'director', 'office', 'civil', 'right', 'ocr', 'claim', 'maine', 'department', 'education', 'currently', 'violate', 'title', 'ix', 'deny', 'female', 'student', 'athlete', 'state', 'maine', 'equal', 'opportunity', 'participate', 'school', 'athletic', 'possible', 'inclusion', 'trans', 'girl', 'offer', 'additional', 'opportunity', 'people', 'assert', 'gender', 'identity', 'different', 'sex', 'constitute', 'discrimination', 'basis', 'gender', 'identity', 'student', 'identify', 'sex', 'document', 'continue', 'archeval', 'letter', 'explicitly', 'cast', 'aside', 'discussion', 'trans', 'boy', 'assert', 'cis', 'boy', 'subject', 'heighten', 'safety', 'competitive', 'concern', 'sport', 'absent', 'document', 'record', 'official', 'investigation', 'usually', 'include', 'interview', 'witness', 'collect', 'evidence', 'course', 'week', 'month', 'instead', 'archeval', 'letter', 'reference', 'news', 'story', 'allege', 'trans', 'girl', 'participate', 'high', 'school', 'sport', 'maine', 'story', 'publish', 'outkick', 'right', 'wing', 'sport', 'website', 'know', 'negative', 'coverage', 'trans', 'athlete', 'focus', 'allegation', 'trans', 'girl', 'place', 'fourth', 'competitive', 'skiing', 'event', 'base', 'facebook', 'post', 'month', 'maine', 'republican', 'rep', 'laurel', 'libby', 'libby', 'post', 'photo', 'high', 'schooler', 'claim', 'trans', 'recently', 'win', 'track', 'meet', 'identity', 'student', 'publicly', 'confirm', 'name', 'high', 'school', 'temporarily', 'increase', 'security', 'day', 'libby', 'post', 'libby', 'censure', 'state', 'house', 'representative', 'refuse', 'apologize', 'week', 'danna', 'haye', 'spokesperson', 'frey', 'office', 'tell', 'portland', 'press', 'herald', 'pende', 'litigation', 'state', 'title', 'ix', 'hayes', 'tell', 'bangor', 'daily', 'news', 'action', 'take', 'federal', 'government', 'regard', 'strip', 'funding', 'state', 'department', 'education', 'trump', 'threaten', 'mill', 'office', 'decline', 'comment', 'reporter', 'week', 'direct', 'press', 'governor', 'previous', 'statement', 'say', 'outcome', 'politically', 'direct', 'investigation', 'predetermine', 'take', 'office', 'january', 'trump', 'seek', 'eliminate', 'civil', 'right', 'tran', 'people', 'numerous', 'area', 'particularly', 'right', 'tran', 'minor', 'participate', 'school', 'sport', 'receive', 'gender', 'affirm', 'medical', 'care', 'address', 'congress', 'early', 'week', 'trump', 'repeatedly', 'denigrate', 'misgendere', 'trans', 'people', 'age', 'vow', 'wokeness', 'dead', 'administration']",
3995a575-7310-4a97-925a-22a32e03ca0c,pro,what’s the safest way for trans americans to travel right now?,"['safe', 'way', 'tran', 'americans', 'travel', 'right']",them,kate sosin,https://www.them.us/story/safe-travel-trans-americans-passport-policy,3/20/2025,"even before president donald trump took office for his second term, transgender americans reported harassment and discrimination while traveling. but in january, the administration announced it would no longer issue “x” gender markers on passports or allow transgender americans to update passports to accurately reflect who they are. the announcement coincided with a slew of executive orders targeting transgender people.

since then, many trans people have started making preparations to travel abroad. but how safe is it to travel and what documents are needed? with reports of federal officials seizing documents circulating on social media and anxiety running high, the 19th asked the country’s best experts on trans documents some of the hardest questions on what trans travelers should expect. here’s what we learned:

is my passport that has an updated gender marker still valid?
yes. in the first days of the trump administration, confusion was rampant. the state department has since clarified that all current valid passports, including those with “x” gender markers, will be honored.

advocates caution that transgender travelers may still face harassment from state and federal officials who feel emboldened by the apparent hostility coming from the trump administration.

arli christian, senior policy counsel at the american civil liberties union (aclu), advises transgender travelers to carry backup documents like a birth certificate and a copy of the federal policy to give them more leverage and confidence.

“really make sure you’re armed with all the information you need to calmly inform an officer what your rights are,” christian said.

can i still update the gender marker on my passport to reflect who i am post transition?
not now, but maybe soon. for now, the state department is not accepting requests to update gender markers to correctly reflect transgender people’s genders. in fact, many transgender people have applied for passports since trump took office and received documents back with an inaccurate gender marker. 

but carl charles, a senior attorney in the southern regional office of lambda legal, the nation’s largest lgbtq+ legal group, said in an informational session for the general public this month that those looking for updated passports still have reason for hope.

the aclu is suing the trump administration over the gender marker passport policy, and the organization is seeking a preliminary injunction, or an immediate halt to the policy, while the case plays out in court. a judge is expected to rule on the injunction within the next few weeks.

“if it is the case that the judge enters an injunction and stops this passport policy from being in effect, that may be the time when people with upcoming renewals or soon-to-expire passports want to submit a passport application, because there may be a chance there may be a window that they can get a document with a correct gender marker,” charles said.

what if i want to revert my gender marker back to my sex assigned at birth for safety reasons?
the 19th has confirmed a handful of cases in which transgender people or the parents of transgender youth have successfully reverted documents back to a marker reflecting a person’s sex assigned at birth. for some, including those with “x” gender markers, this can feel like a safer option because they may face less scrutiny from officials.

will my documents be seized if i reenter the country?
a number of transgender people have expressed reluctance to leave the united states for fear that their passports will be confiscated upon their return.

the 19th has not found confirmed cases of this happening, and lambda legal, which is tracking several transgender travelers, has not either.

does canada accept my “x” gender marker? is canada trans friendly?
yes, and yes.

“the government of canada recognizes the ‘x’ gender identifier,” according to a government page designed specifically for lgbtq+ travelers.

the 19th got the same response from multiple canadian officials, who noted that transgender americans would be welcome to come to canada as tourists, temporary residents or even asylum seekers.

“in my personal opinion, canadians would welcome americans to canada,” said kate rogers, a spokesperson from canada’s tourism agency, in an email. “and, as part of the lgbtq2+ community, the government of canada supports this community as does the canadian border services agency.”

i have to get a passport for my children. will using my passport as a trans person applying for my kids put me at risk of document seizure?
christian advises that this is likely safe but that applicants should use caution, adding that the state department does not have the right to update a person’s passport if they are not the applicant.

“i would certainly use the birth certificate as proof of citizenship rather than sending in your fully valid u.s. passport,” they said. “because the concern i would have is that the state department will see that passport, see that they may notice that the sex designation is not sex at birth, according to their new policy, and they may take it upon themselves to go ahead and update that.”

is it still safe to fly with my driver’s license? what if my license has an “x” designation?
every piece of guidance from advocates, both formal and anecdotal, suggests that state ids and driver’s licenses are not impacted by the state department policy.

amy paris, who formerly worked for the federal government and led the implementation of “x” gender markers on passports, told the 19th that as of now, transportation security administration officials have not been advised to scrutinize gender markers in screenings.

“if they have a state-issued real id in their proper gender, in the gender they identify with, they will probably be able to fly just fine,” paris said.

but paris also urged caution, especially for gender-nonconforming travelers. “i hate that we’re talking about passing privilege here, but it’s just a fact,” paris said.

“if it is more likely that a transportation security officer is going to identify you as trans, then i would say, yeah, if it’s possible to take the bus or the train and you’re worried about getting unnecessarily patted down, or having your documentation questioned, the bus or the train is probably a better mode of travel,” she said.

advocates are recommending that trans people don’t use passports domestically — why?
“i think a lot of what we’re trying to do is reduce the possibility of undue scrutiny, harassment, discrimination, as you’re moving through security and so again, every individual is really best suited to know what that looks like for them,” christian said. “but if you’ve got a passport that has a sex designation that does not match who you are, and a state id that does, my recommendation would be to use that state id.”","['president', 'donald', 'trump', 'take', 'office', 'second', 'term', 'transgender', 'americans', 'report', 'harassment', 'discrimination', 'travel', 'january',

f6a68e56-55cf-4f01-a649-5912e070f9fb,pro,researchers rush to save u.s. government data on trans youth — before it disappears,"['researcher', 'rush', 'save', 'government', 'datum', 'trans', 'youth', 'disappear']",them,angela watercutter,https://www.them.us/story/researchers-us-government-data-trans-youth,3/21/2025,"on a friday afternoon in mid-march, a bunch of (presumably) non-hackers showed up to participate in a new kind of “hackathon.” it was pi day, so pie was served, but the mood wasn’t celebratory. students, researchers, and members of the wider public health community were there, in a lecture hall at the harvard t.h. chan school of public health and on zoom, to rescue data. whatever they could. according to the flier for the preserving public health data hackathon, the current trump administration was trying to undermine research on everything from climate change to systemic racism, and saving data from government websites meant it would be archived and republished in the event federal agencies tried to remove it. the antiauthoritarian theme came up often: don’t obey in advance.

everyone in the room and on the zoom got a crash course in identifying at-risk information, collecting it, and storing it once they did. backing up certain pieces seemed critical.

for those who work in public health, protecting research pertaining to gender identity and diversity issues has been a focus since the inauguration. last year, then-candidate trump repeated a lot of anti-trans rhetoric on the campaign trail, and in the first weeks of his presidency signed executive orders essentially barring transgender people from serving in the military, proclaiming that the us government would only recognize “two genders, male and female,” threatening to withhold federal funds in what is an attempt to bar trans women from sports, and attempting to block gender-affirming care for people under the age of 19. since trump’s inauguration, hundreds of words—from “transgender” to “latinx” to “accessible”—have been removed from federal agencies’ websites. in early february, thousands of websites went missing as agencies raced to comply with the executive orders.

in recent weeks, the targeting of gender-related material has become even starker, after trump told a joint session of congress that the so-called department of government efficiency (doge) had uncovered that the federal government had spent $8 million on “making mice transgender” (it hasn’t), and the department of defense performed a purge of “dei” materials that included flagging, but ultimately not removing, images of the enola gay.

one particular dataset, the youth risk behavior surveillance system (commonly shortened to yrbs), seems particularly at-risk, notes ariel beccia, an epidemiologist at the chan school’s lgbtq health center of excellence. the yrbs, which tracks scores of health-related issues in young people, is one of the only nationally representative surveys that regularly collects data on transgender kids. beccia and other public health researchers fear the information in the yrbs may not be available forever.

and even if the yrbs can be backed up, the integrity of its data can’t be completely protected from the influence of the new administration. president trump’s recent moves have also left some in public service afraid to participate in new research, like this year’s survey. “because of this ‘comply in advance’ strategy, school boards are hesitant to participate in the yrbs,” beccia told attendees at the hackathon.

beccia would know. her research focuses on race and ethnicity as well as lgbtq+ young people. she’s recently been looking into lgtbq+ inequities in eating disorders. her work relies on yrbs data. now that the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc), which hosts the survey’s results, has reportedly stopped processing data on trans americans, and fewer schools are participating, the data beccia uses, even if it stays online, will be incomplete.

when asked about this, cdc spokesperson melissa dibble confirmed that, in compliance with trump’s executive orders, “the transgender identity question was removed from the national youth risk behavior survey,” but no other changes were made. dibble added that the change shouldn’t delay the survey’s results.

it’s created a “double whammy” situation, beccia says, where government employees are trying to comply with trump’s executive orders and school districts are afraid to participate in any study related to gender or lgbtq+ health, even if it is data that in turn guides how they run their schools.

“we are living through a pretty scary time with the administration,” beccia tells me a few days after the event. “this is obviously impacting the mental health of everyone in the country, especially queer and trans people and queer and trans youth, and we’re not going to have data on this.”

the yrbs is just one of many datasets researchers have sought to shore up in a long-running effort to preserve government-funded information as the new administration takes control. the university of washington information school held “data rescue” events in january aimed at collecting climate crisis information. the environmental data and governance initiative (edgi), a network of research professionals that launched a tool during trump’s first term to track changes to environmental information on federal websites, relaunched that tracker at the beginning of march. the data rescue project, a consortium of data-rescue organizations, lists dozens of ways people can get involved if they want to help collect. a group of archivists has recreated the pre-inauguration day version of the cdc website and is now hosting it in europe at restoredcdc.org.

other organizations are also looking to back up the yrbs, too. on january 30, soon after trump signed the first of his executive orders aimed at trans americans, libby hemphill, director of the resource center for minority data at the inter-university consortium of political and social research (icpsr), started getting calls. word had gotten out that the cdc might be scrubbing data, including the yrbs, and people wanted to know how to stop it. hemphill gathered some colleagues and started scraping it. then there were requests for data from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration (noaa), from the department of education, from the national institutes of health.

much like the data-preservation effort at the chan school, hemphill and her team coordinated ways for people to submit data they wanted to preserve and ways for researchers to collect it and store it. the icpsr runs a repository known as datalumos, where a lot of the preservation efforts are backing up their collections. when i ask hemphill if she’s worried about the safety of the information in the datalumos archive, she says “it’s absolutely something that we think about,” adding, “i can assure you that icpsr has a non-us physical, non-us regulatory plan for data preservation.”

if you think this sounds familiar, you’re not wrong. when trump assumed the presidency in 2017, scientists, archivists, and librarians at the university of pennsylvania raced to save data published by the environmental protection agency (epa) and noaa. another group in michigan, also fearing the epa and noaa websites would lose valuable information, made a similar move. websites were backed up to the internet archive; large datasets were “bagged” for safe keeping.

at the time, the researchers weren’t sure the incoming administration would seek to erase any info. it was more like a hunch, one that proved prescient when, then being led by trump appointee and agency administrator scott pruitt, the epa began removing climate change information from its website in april 2017, “to reflect the approach of new leadership.”

between 2017 and 2021, more than 1,400 pages related to climate change on government web sites were altered or made less accessible, according to data compiled by the edgi. that, notes gretchen gehrke, who leads edgi’s website monitoring program, is not “a comprehensive list of changes,” since some alterations—like removing “climate change” from the navigation page of epa.gov—only get counted once but affect several other pages.

“i think there is a lot more awareness about the precarity of federal information after having experienced the first trump administration,” gehrke says. “watching the trump campaign become truly obsessed with trans people, and knowing the trump administration’s history of information suppression, people were and are rightly concerned that that information is at risk.”

which is why beccia is concerned. datasets like those in the yrbs are few and far between and losing it could be disastrous to those wanting to know about the health and well-being of trans youth in america.

although the yrbs is currently live on the cdc’s website, it did briefly disappear, along with data on the food and drug administration and department of health and human services web sites, earlier this year following an order from the office of personnel management that it be scrubbed to comply with trump’s executive orders.

the information returned in mid-february when us district judge john bates, responding to a lawsuit from doctors for america, granted a temporary restraining order and the site was reinstated. a disclaimer at the top of the yrbs page now says “any information on this page promoting gender ideology is extremely inaccurate,” adding “this page does not reflect biological reality and therefore the administration and this department rejects it.”

tazlina mannix worked for the yrbs program in alaska from 2015 until 2023, both as survey coordinator and data manager. she notes that even if the cdc keeps the data online, disclaimers like the one on the site now make it harder for researchers to do their work. collecting public health data relies on relationships with people in health departments and school districts. giving those people any reason to hesitate can “set you back to zero,” she says. “when i first saw [that disclaimer], i was so horrified. the language is so extreme, and it’s also just wrong.”","['friday', 'afternoon',

2781b4f3-b6c9-4f3e-9540-790a7fbbf53e,pro,inside democrats’ reshuffling on trans issues,"['inside', 'democrat', 'reshuffling', 'trans', 'issue']",them,oriana gonzález,https://www.them.us/story/notus-inside-democrats-reshuffling-on-trans-issues,3/21/2025,"democrats are starting to have serious conversations around how to handle transgender rights politically ahead of next year’s elections — after, by their own admission, they were caught flat-footed on the issue in 2024.
the upshot, so far: don’t be so dogmatic that you risk alienating voters and allies.

rep. sarah mcbride, the first openly trans member of congress, and her staff have spoken to her democratic colleagues about the topic, notus has learned. the delaware congresswoman has cautioned moderate democrats that the tenor and tone of their comments — particularly on questioning trans athletes in sports, which is where most of the debate has focused — might inflame and splinter factions instead of being productive.

“we have to create more space in our tent. if, for instance, we want to have a majoritarian coalition — not just electorally, but specifically on issues around trans rights — that, by necessity, is going to have to include people who have a range of thoughts,” mcbride told notus.

“a binary choice between being all-on or all-off is not constructive for anyone,” mcbride continued. “it impedes the very needed path toward winning electorally, winning hearts and minds and, most importantly, winning progress.”

republicans have already clearly signaled their plans to lean on trans issues in next year’s campaigns, after their success in 2024. president donald trump said last week that he has directed his party to not bring up trans issues “because there is no election right now.”

“but about a week before the election, bring it up because you can’t lose,” he told reporters from the oval office.

the pew research center found that americans’ support for restrictions on trans people increased between 2022 and 2025. for example, 58% of survey respondents in 2022 said they supported requiring trans athletes to compete in sports that “match the sex they were assigned at birth.” that increased to 66% in 2025.

in 2022, 46% of respondents supported making it illegal for health providers to offer gender-affirming care to trans minors. that number rose to 56% in 2025.

some members — like reps. seth moulton and tom suozzi, both of whom have recently met with mcbride — received immediate intraparty backlash for publicly saying they oppose having trans athletes participate in women’s and girls’ sports. mcbride thinks that type of response is unproductive.

“i think it is an incredibly problematic instinct that many have to excommunicate people who aren’t in lockstep with you on every policy, or even aren’t in lockstep with you on the messaging,” she said.

mcbride is by no means the only house member who has been ruminating on the topic.

rep. greg landsman, whose district was targeted by house republicans’ campaign arm, which opposed his support for trans rights, told notus that democrats are having “very informal” conversations on the topic.

they look like, “you pull somebody aside and you just say, ‘what do you think?’ or ‘this is what i’m hearing’ — how americans talk. we’re not enacting legislation like [republicans] are that is intended to just be mean as fuck and it’s not solving problems,” landsman said.

“i do think there is, on the positive side, a growing appreciation that democrats could be a little judgy and annoying about this, and maybe we should be open-minded and appreciate that not everyone is where we are,” he continued.

the conversations were particularly prevalent in january, when the house voted on a bill to ban trans athletes from participating in sports teams of their preferred gender. the bill passed with only three democrats defecting from the rest of the party. one of those votes came from rep. vicente gonzalez.

“i’ve had some people be critical of my vote, but i think the vast majority of people in my district agree with me, and i think the vast majority of people around the country do too,” gonzalez told notus.

the south texas congressman said he “spoke to especially front-line battleground members. i told everybody what vote i was going to take before i took it.” ultimately, only reps. henry cuellar and don davis — to whom gonzalez confirmed he spoke with beforehand — joined him in separating from the rest of the caucus. (cuellar and gonzalez voted in support, davis voted present).

had house democratic leadership not whipped against the bill (notus viewed the notice sent to congressional offices at the time), gonzalez said, “i think you would have seen 20 or 30 members vote with us.”

gonzalez told notus that he spoke with caucus leaders, although declined to name who, to demand that leadership not whip future bills that had to do with trans issues. (in response to this, a spokesperson for house minority whip katherine clark told notus in a statement, “we don’t disclose conversations with members regarding our whip strategy.”)

“i don’t agree with whipping those types of votes,” gonzalez said. “i think everyone should vote their conscience, their ideology, the values of their district, and that’s how we win races.”

clark said in a statement that the “republican strategy is to divide americans instead of bringing the country together around solutions.”

house democrats’ most common messaging strategy on trans issues, advised by mcbride after the election, has been to treat republicans’ anti-trans attacks as a distraction and to pivot to other issues.

moulton has also been making an effort to ensure the caucus is more receptive to nuanced opinions around trans issues.

in january, moulton spoke separately with rep. mark takano, chair of the congressional equality caucus, and rep. becca balint, co-chair of the caucus, about ensuring that the caucus is open to different opinions on trans issues, according to two sources familiar.

both lawmakers, one of the sources said, were receptive to mouton’s stance.

takano told notus in a statement that a “critical” part about being equality caucus chair is his “commitment to creating spaces where every member of congress can have their genuine questions listened to and answered, without judgment.”

“we recognize that there is more work to do to win some of the hearts and minds of the general public, given people’s lack of familiarity with the trans community and the prevalence of right-wing anti-trans propaganda and disinformation, and we are working to make sure members have the information and support they need to be that bridge,” takano added.

similarly, balint said in a statement that “it’s critical to have hard conversations around this, both inside and outside of congress.”

in an interview, moulton told notus that democrats needed to borrow a page from republicans’ playbook.

california's democratic governor was once considered an lgbtq+ ally. so, what’s with the heel turn?
“republicans clearly don’t agree on everything, but they’ve succeeded in recent years in broadening their tent so that whether you’re a maga trumper or a much more traditional republican, you can still get behind the party and they’re not being kicked out,” he said.

the congressman added, though, that he believes there’s no room within the democratic party for views that completely oppose trans rights.

“that crosses the line of civil rights,” moulton said.

moulton, who confirmed that he has spoken with mcbride about trans issues, was optimistic about the informal conversations taking place within the caucus. but he added that there haven’t been any broader conversations brought by leadership around how to handle trans issues “because people are still scared to have them.”

but with a broader discussion now taking place among the american public, some democrats are attempting to slowly start one within the party.

“i do think i understand, as a trans person, how to meet people who aren’t trans where they are, and how to find commonality with people,” mcbride said. “part of that is creating room for a lack of understanding, for disagreement, for grace and, therefore, to create room for growth.”","['democrats', 'start', 'conversation', 'handle', 'transgender', 'right', 'politically', 'ahead', 'year',

70128ef2-c8fa-44e3-a0b6-5a3b64bca3b6,pro,trump hints that attacking trans rights will be the gop’s 2026 midterm strategy,"['trump', 'hint', 'attack', 'trans', 'right', 'gop', 'midterm', 'strategy']",them,samantha riedel,https://www.them.us/story/trump-trans-rights-2026-midterm-elections-wedge-issue,3/21/2025,"the republican party is already gearing up to campaign against the rights of transgender people in the next election season, if recent remarks by president donald trump are to be believed.

last week, trump twice referenced trans women and girls who play in women’s sports leagues — a practice he is attempting to federally outlaw — during meetings at the white house, and hinted at the role targeting them might play in the next major election cycle. on march 13, trump derided trans women in sports during remarks with nato secretary general mark rutte. in that meeting, trump told members of the press that democrats have “bad politics” on trans rights, scoffing at what he deemed “men being able to play in women’s sports” and remarking that republicans could once again use it as a wedge issue.

“[i]n a way, i want them [democrats] to keep doing it [talking about trans athletes], because i don’t think they can win a race,” trump said. he added that he had told other republicans, “‘don’t bring that subject up, because there’s no election right now. but about a week before the election, bring it up, because you can’t lose.’”

prior to those remarks, trump also complained that “[e]verything is transgender, everybody transgender” during a march 12 meeting with irish prime minister micheál martin, echoing his previous statement to time that trans rights have “ripped apart our country.” trump went on to claim that “that is why we won the election,” and that trans women “are hurting [cisgender] women very badly.” (trump previously made the false claim that trans women athletes are a physical danger to cis women during his joint address to congress in early march.)


if trump did indeed tell republican lawmakers not to bring up trans athletes until closer to their next elections, it doesn’t seem like anyone was listening. (it’s not clear which elections trump was referring to, though some gubernatorial and state legislative races are set to take place in the u.s. this year prior to the 2026 midterms.) south carolina rep. nancy mace, in particular, has made flagrant transphobia into a personal brand, issuing numerous calls on social media for trans women to be excluded from women’s spaces with her adopted slogan “hold the line.” trump himself has made his trans sports ban a top priority in his first two months in office, using the specter of trans athletes to justify sweeping funding freezes for multiple university systems.

in the 2024 elections, republicans — with trump at the helm — laid siege to democrats on trans-inclusive athletics, spending millions on ads that cast former vice president kamala harris as a far-left radical for trans rights. in reality, harris and many other democratic candidates largely avoided talking about trans people at all; late in the campaign, after republicans had already put democrats on the defensive, harris stated only that her administration would “follow the law” regarding the treatment of incarcerated trans people.

trump’s statements last week came amid ongoing speculation that democrats lack a coherent plan for advancing trans rights. since harris’ loss, some democrats have accepted the republican framing that their party is too radical, apparently including delaware rep. sarah mcbride, the first out trans woman to serve in congress. one week after trump’s remarks, mcbride — herself the target of denigrating remarks by mace and other gop lawmakers — confirmed to notus that she had told fellow democrats they must “create more space in our tent” and “include people who have a range of thoughts” on the rights of trans people without “excommunicating” dissenters.

“a binary choice between being all-on or all-off is not constructive for anyone [...] it impedes the very needed path toward winning electorally, winning hearts and minds and, most importantly, winning progress,” mcbride told notus.

mcbride reportedly shared this perspective with massachusetts rep. seth moulton, one of several democrats who claimed that harris had lost because of trans rights mere days after the 2024 elections. moulton told notus that congressional democrats, even now, have not held formal conversations about how to handle trans topics in general, “because people are still scared to have them.”

that mindset isn’t limited to the house, either. california gov. gavin newsom, a potential candidate for the democratic presidential nomination in 2028, was once an outspoken booster of lgbtq+ causes like marriage equality. but newsom appears to have fully retreated on trans-inclusive athletics, conceding to right-wing propagandists charlie kirk and michael savage without a fuss in the first two episodes of newsom’s podcast earlier this month.

despite the reportedly ongoing disorganization within the party, senate democrats successfully blocked a republican-sponsored bill several weeks ago that would have banned trans women and girls from women’s sports leagues in k-12 schools and public universities. whether a repeat performance is possible has yet to be determined.","['republican', 'party', 'gear', 'campaign', 'right', 'transgender', 'people', 'election', 'season', 'recent', 'remark', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'believe', 'week', 'trump', 'twice', 'reference', 'tran', 'woman', 'girl', 'play', 'woman', 'sport', 'league', 'practice', 'attempt', 'federally', 'outlaw', 'meeting', 'white', 'house', 'hint', 'role', 'target', 'play', 'major', 'election', 'cycle', 'march', 'trump', 'deride', 'tran', 'woman', 'sport', 'remark', 'nato', 'secretary', 'general', 'mark', 'rutte', 'meeting', 'trump', 'tell', 'member', 'press', 'democrats', 'bad', 'politic', 'trans', 'right', 'scoff', 'deem', 'man', 'able', 'play', 'woman', 'sport', 'remark', 'republicans', 'use', 'wedge', 'issue', 'way', 'want', 'democrat', 'talk', 'trans', 'athlete', 'think', 'win', 'race', 'trump', 'say', 'add', 'tell', 'republican', 'bring', 'subject', 'election', 'right', 'week', 'election', 'bring', 'lose', 'prior', 'remark', 'trump', 'complain', 'transgender', 'everybody', 'transgender', 'march', 'meeting', 'irish', 'prime', 'minister', 'micheál', 'martin', 'echo', 'previous', 'statement', 'time', 'trans', 'right', 'rip', 'apart', 'country', 'trump', 'go', 'claim', 'win', 'election', 'trans', 'woman', 'hurt', 'cisgender', 'woman', 'badly', 'trump', 'previously', 'false', 'claim', 'trans', 'woman', 'athlete', 'physical', 'danger', 'cis', 'woman', 'joint', 'address', 'congress', 'early', 'march', 'trump', 'tell', 'republican', 'lawmaker', 'bring', 'trans', 'athlete', 'close', 'election', 'like', 'listen', 'clear', 'election', 'trump', 'refer', 'gubernatorial', 'state', 'legislative', 'race', 'set', 'place', 'year', 'prior', 'midterm', 'south', 'carolina', 'rep', 'nancy', 'mace', 'particular', 'flagrant', 'transphobia', 'personal', 'brand', 'issue', 'numerous', 'call', 'social', 'medium', 'tran', 'woman', 'exclude', 'woman', 'space', 'adopt', 'slogan', 'hold', 'line', 'trump', 'trans', 'sport', 'ban', 'priority', 'month', 'office', 'specter', 'trans', 'athlete', 'justify', 'sweeping', 'funding', 'freeze', 'multiple', 'university', 'system', 'election', 'republicans', 'trump', 'helm', 'lay', 'siege', 'democrats', 'trans', 'inclusive', 'athletic', 'spend', 'million', 'ad', 'cast', 'vice', 'president', 'kamala', 'harris', 'far', 'left', 'radical', 'tran', 'right', 'reality', 'harris', 'democratic', 'candidate', 'largely', 'avoid', 'talk', 'trans', 'people', 'late', 'campaign', 'republicans', 'democrat', 'defensive', 'harris', 'state', 'administration', 'follow', 'law', 'treatment', 'incarcerated', 'trans', 'people', 'trump', 'statement', 'week', 'come', 'amid', 'ongoing', 'speculation', 'democrats', 'lack', 'coherent', 'plan', 'advance', 'trans', 'right', 'harris', 'loss', 'democrats', 'accept', 'republican', 'framing', 'party', 'radical', 'apparently', 'include', 'delaware', 'rep', 'sarah', 'mcbride', 'trans', 'woman', 'serve', 'congress', 'week', 'trump', 'remark', 'mcbride', 'target', 'denigrate', 'remark', 'mace', 'gop', 'lawmaker', 'confirm', 'notus', 'tell', 'fellow', 'democrat', 'create', 'space', 'tent', 'include', 'people', 'range', 'thought', 'right', 'tran', 'people', 'excommunicate', 'dissenter', 'binary', 'choice', 'constructive', 'impede', 'needed', 'path', 'win', 'electorally', 'win', 'heart', 'mind', 'importantly', 'win', 'progress', 'mcbride', 'tell', 'notus', 'mcbride', 'reportedly', 'share', 'perspective', 'massachusetts', 'rep', 'seth', 'moulton', 'democrat', 'claim', 'harris', 'lose', 'trans', 'right', 'mere', 'day', 'election', 'moulton', 'tell', 'notus', 'congressional', 'democrat', 'hold', 'formal', 'conversation', 'handle', 'trans', 'topic', 'general', 'people', 'scared', 'mindset', 'limit', 'house', 'california', 'gov', 'gavin', 'newsom', 'potential', 'candidate', 'democratic', 'presidential', 'nomination', 'outspoken', 'booster', 'cause', 'like', 'marriage', 'equality', 'newsom', 'appear', 'fully', 'retreat', 'trans', 'inclusive', 'athletic', 'concede', 'right', 'wing', 'propagandist', 'charlie', 'kirk', 'michael', 'savage', 'fuss', 'episode', 'newsom', 'podcast', 'early', 'month', 'despite', 'reportedly', 'ongoing', 'disorganization', 'party', 'senate', 'democrats', 'successfully', 'block', 'republican', 'sponsor', 'bill', 'week', 'ago', 'ban', 'trans', 'woman', 'girl', 'woman', 'sport', 'league', 'school', 'public', 'university', 'repeat', 'performance', 'possible', 'determine']",

denmark, finland, and germany have all issued guidance this past month advising trans travelers to check with u.s. authorities before attempting to enter the country, the associated press reported. last friday, denmark’s ministry of foreign affairs updated its website to note that there are only two gender designations when applying for a visa to the u.s. “if your passport has the gender designation x or you have changed gender, it is recommended to contact the us embassy prior to travel for guidance on how to proceed,” the website now reads. (danes have been able to designate an x gender marker on identity documents since 2014, per ilga-europe.)

finland also updated its travel advisory earlier this month, according to the guardian, with its travel advice page now reading, “if the applicant’s current sex on their passport is different from their sex confirmed at birth, the u.s. authorities may refuse entry.” additionally, the german daily newspaper, rheinische post, reported in february that germany’s federal foreign office stated that trans and nonbinary people should contact the u.s.’s german embassy before traveling to the country.

when asked about those advisories, a state department spokesperson told npr that the u.s. “will enforce visa rules and other conditions of entry.”

“prohibiting travel into the united states by those who might pose a threat or violate conditions of their visa is key to protecting the american people,” the spokesperson said.

though none of the countries’ advisories mentioned the trump administration specifically, the updated guidance comes in the wake of the federal government’s attempts to prohibit changes to passport gender markers and abolish x markers. in addition to cracking down on trans people’s identity documents, the federal government has also been subjecting all foreign travel to additional layers of scrutiny. earlier this month, a french researcher was denied entry to the u.s. when immigration officers found messages on his phone that were reportedly critical of the trump administration’s treatment of scientists. the u.s. has also been engaging in mass deportations despite a judge’s order, including that of over 200 venezuelan men, one of whom is a gay asylum seeker.

the u.k. and canada have also issued stronger warnings about the u.s. government. according to reuters, the british foreign office’s travel advice section now states, “the authorities in the u.s. set and enforce entry rules strictly. you may be liable to arrest or detention if you break the rules.” it previously read, “the authorities in the u.s. set and enforce entry rules.” meanwhile, canada’s travel advisory website states that canadians visiting the u.s. for “longer than 30 days must be registered with the united states government,” or risk “penalties, fines and misdemeanor prosecution.” as npr notes, this isn’t the first time other countries have issued travel advisories for the u.s., but those have largely been related to gun violence, not the government itself.","['multiple', 'european', 'country', 'issue', 'advisory', 'transgender', 'people', 'travel', 'light', 'trump', 'administration', 'recent', 'guidance', 'sex', 'marker', 'passport', 'federal', 'government', 'immigration', 'crackdown', 'general', 'heighten', 'scrutiny', 'travel', 'document', 'border', 'denmark', 'finland', 'germany', 'issue', 'guidance', 'past', 'month', 'advise', 'tran', 'traveler', 'check', 'authority', 'attempt', 'enter', 'country', 'associated', 'press', 'report', 'friday', 'denmark', 'ministry', 'foreign', 'affairs', 'update', 'website', 'note', 'gender', 'designation', 'apply', 'visa', 'passport', 'gender', 'designation', 'x', 'change', 'gender', 'recommend', 'contact', 'embassy', 'prior', 'travel', 'guidance', 'proceed', 'website', 'read', 'dane', 'able', 'designate', 'x', 'gender', 'marker', 'identity', 'document', 'ilga', 'europe', 'finland', 'update', 'travel', 'advisory', 'early', 'month', 'accord', 'guardian', 'travel', 'advice', 'page', 'read', 'applicant', 'current', 'sex', 'passport', 'different', 'sex', 'confirm', 'birth', 'authority', 'refuse', 'entry', 'additionally', 'german', 'daily', 'newspaper', 'rheinische', 'post', 'report', 'february', 'germany', 'federal', 'foreign', 'office', 'state', 'trans', 'nonbinary', 'people', 'contact', 'german', 'embassy', 'travel', 'country', 'ask', 'advisory', 'state', 'department', 'spokesperson', 'tell', 'npr', 'enforce', 'visa', 'rule', 'condition', 'entry', 'prohibit', 'travel', 'united', 'states', 'pose', 'threat', 'violate', 'condition', 'visa', 'key', 'protect', 'american', 'people', 'spokesperson', 'say', 'country', 'advisory', 'mention', 'trump', 'administration', 'specifically', 'update', 'guidance', 'come', 'wake', 'federal', 'government', 'attempt', 'prohibit', 'change', 'passport', 'gender', 'marker', 'abolish', 'x', 'marker', 'addition', 'crack', 'trans', 'people', 'identity', 'document', 'federal', 'government', 'subject', 'foreign', 'travel', 'additional', 'layer', 'scrutiny', 'early', 'month', 'french', 'researcher', 'deny', 'entry', 'immigration', 'officer', 'find', 'message', 'phone', 'reportedly', 'critical', 'trump', 'administration', 'treatment', 'scientist', 'engage', 'mass', 'deportation', 'despite', 'judge', 'order', 'include', 'venezuelan', 'man', 'gay', 'asylum', 'seeker', 'canada', 'issue', 'strong', 'warning', 'government', 'accord', 'reuter', 'british', 'foreign', 'office', 'travel', 'advice', 'section', 'state', 'authority', 'set', 'enforce', 'entry', 'rule', 'strictly', 'liable', 'arrest', 'detention', 'break', 'rule', 'previously', 'read', 'authority', 'set', 'enforce', 'entry', 'rule', 'canada', 'travel', 'advisory', 'website', 'state', 'canadian', 'visit', 'long', 'day', 'register', 'united', 'states', 'government', 'risk', 'penalty', 'fine', 'misdemeanor', 'prosecution', 'npr', 'note', 'time', 'country', 'issue', 'travel', 'advisory', 'largely', 'relate', 'gun', 'violence', 'government']",
f49a1fd8-ce12-429c-aecd-7a7c853b77eb,pro,trump admin moves to prevent aca plans from being required to cover gender-affirming care,"['trump', 'admin', 'move', 'prevent', 'aca', 'plan', 'require', 'cover', 'gender', 'affirm', 'care']",them,samantha riedel,https://www.them.us/story/alarming-proposal-trump-administration-prohibit-affordable-care-act-gender-affirming-care,3/26/2025,"the trump administration has proposed a new rule that would prohibit health insurance plans under the affordable care act (aca) from classifying gender-affirming care as an essential health benefit (ehb), the latest of republicans’ attacks on transgender healthcare.

proposed as part of a 300-page rules change package by the centers for medicare & medicaid services (cms) and department of health and human services (hhs) on march 10, the draft rule does not ban gender-affirming care from insurance coverage outright, but would specifically block insurers “from providing coverage for sex-trait modification as an ehb in any state” beginning in 2026. the proposal uses the phrase “sex-trait modification” in place of the term “gender-affirming care,” but does not offer a definition, instead requesting “feedback” as to whether a definition should be formally adopted.

under the aca, insurance plans sold through the aca marketplace are required to cover all ehbs as defined by the benchmarks of the state in which they operate. the rule, if enacted as proposed, would remove hormone replacement therapy, gender-affirming surgery, puberty blockers, and other forms of gender-affirming medical care from the list of valid ehbs. insurers would still be allowed, but not required, to offer coverage for such care. (other services excluded from ehb status include abortion care and non-pediatric dental or eye procedures.) as independent journalist mady castigan and policy analyst corinne green noted earlier this month, many insurance plans use ehb lists as guides even if they are not sold through the aca marketplace, meaning that the rule could have much wider implications than its text alone suggests.

according to data collected by the movement advancement project, 24 states and the district of columbia prohibit health care exclusions targeting trans people. those states would be “required to defray the cost of that state-mandated benefit as it would be considered in addition to” other mandated ehbs. the health policy research organization kff noted this week that insurers in states that do not mandate such coverage could drop coverage of gender-affirming care from their plans altogether should the rule be adopted.

as justification for the new rule, cms and hhs pointed to trump’s executive orders calling for gender-affirming care to be banned for trans youth and demanding an “end to federal funding of gender ideology.” but although it parrots trump’s false definition of “biological sex” (that people are immutably male or female based on whether they have “the biological function to produce” sperm or eggs), the proposal claims that it is not subject to the injunctions blocking them, because it “does not rely on the enjoined sections” of those executive orders. instead, the proposal further claims that gender-affirming care “is not typically included in employer-sponsored plans, and ehb must be equal in scope to a typical employer plan” — ergo, such care cannot be classed as an ehb.

in fact, it is not uncommon for employer-provided health plans in the u.s. to cover gender-affirming care, as kff reported this week. although coverage is uneven across the country, a 2024 kff survey reported that about 24% of businesses with more than 200 employees cover gender-affirming care in their insurance policies. among the country’s largest businesses — those that employ more than 5,000 people — 50% offered coverage for gender-affirming care in their largest plan.

although the trump administration has largely targeted trans people 19 years old and younger in its attacks on gender-affirming care, republicans have signaled for at least a year that they would come for adult care soon after. trump’s orders temporarily led some hospitals to deny gender-affirming care to trans youth while continuing nonconsensual surgeries on intersex children. the cms and hhs proposal also comes as the supreme court continues to deliberate in the landmark case u.s. v. skrmetti, which could decide the legal fate of gender-affirming care for trans youth for years to come.

if you’re reading this, however, you’re not powerless. the cms/hhs proposal is now listed in the federal register, where rule changes are required to be posted for members of the public to comment. (comments do not need to include a person’s name or other identifying information.) as we’ve reported previously, public comment can be an effective tool for voicing dissent: even if officials do adopt the rule, it will be challenged in court (secretary of state marco rubio’s comments about dismantling certain courts notwithstanding), at which point lawyers will be able to draw on public comments as part of the official record to bolster their case.

at the time of writing, the proposal had received over 5,000 comments, many of them opposing the ban on gender-affirming care. the comment period will end on april 11.

“there is no upside to intentionally being cruel to people,” one commenter wrote this week. “this is deeply off-putting and strange to me, as a regular voter, and it makes me feel like my government wants its people to just drop dead.”

9707b391-4119-4fbf-bc9d-e876aefa28eb,pro,"despite trump’s threats, maine will allow trans girls to play sports","['despite', 'trump', 'threat', 'maine', 'allow', 'tran', 'girl', 'play', 'sport']",them,samantha riedel,https://www.them.us/story/maine-trans-girls-sports-policy-defies-trump-administration-title-ix,3/26/2025,"education officials in maine declared this week that they will not sign a compliance agreement with the trump administration, continuing the state’s standoff with president trump over his political fixation on transgender girls in school sports.

on march 17, the u.s. department of health and human services (hhs) stated in a press release that both the maine principals’ association and maine school administrative district no. 51 (msad 51) had violated title ix civil rights law by allowing trans girls to compete with cisgender girls in the same school sports leagues. the release said both entities would be offered “an opportunity to voluntarily commit within 10 days to resolve the matter through a signed agreement or risk referral to the u.s. department of justice for appropriate action.”

but neither the principals’ association nor the msad #51 board of directors will sign that compliance agreement, representatives said this week.

in a statement to wmtw, the principals’ association said that their organization would continue to follow the maine human rights act (mhra), which prohibits education discrimination based on gender identity. “we are unable to sign any resolution agreement that would mandate we create a new policy that would violate the law and mhra,” a spokesperson told wmtw. “as such, we have not signed and will not sign the resolution agreement sent by the federal department of health and human services.”

the msad #51 board of directors likewise said they would not sign an hhs agreement due to the mhra, in a letter sent to district families and obtained by wmtw. the district includes greely high school, which republican maine state representative laurel libby had accused of allowing a trans teen to compete in a track competition last month. libby’s facebook post misgendered and potentially publicly identified the student; the maine house of representatives censured libby for the post.

“we are writing today to inform our community that msad #51 will not be agreeing to the proposed vra sent to our district,” the board of directors wrote, per wmtw. “as stated during our board meeting on march 6th, msad #51 will continue to follow state law and the maine human rights act (mhra). compliance with the proposed vra would be a violation of current maine law.” the board recently conferred with legal counsel during a march 21 meeting, according to the board’s public agenda, but the details of that meeting were not disclosed.

libby’s facebook post targeting the greely high school student sparked a major feud between president trump and maine gov. janet mills in february. mills, a democrat, told trump she would “see [him] in court” during a meeting of the national governors’ association at the white house, after trump demanded she defer to his executive orders purporting to “end gender ideology” in federal policy. “we will follow the law,” mills said at the time; executive orders are, notably, not laws. multiple federal agencies immediately opened investigations into the state, with hhs’s investigation of the state department of education lasting just four calendar days. (hhs officials expanded their investigation to include the maine principals’ association and msad #51 in early march.)

in a post on his majority-owned social media platform truth social last week, trump claimed that he had received an “apology” from the state of maine for mills’ defiance, but it’s not clear what, if any, actual apology he was referencing, or who delivered it, as wgme noted this week. it was apparently not from mills herself, as trump also demanded a “full throated apology” from the governor in that post, along with “a statement that she will never make such an unlawful challenge to the federal government again.”

mills ignored trump’s demand for an apology in a statement obtained by wgme on monday. “i read the constitution. the constitution says that the president, the chief executive, shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed. it doesn’t allow him to make laws out of whole cloth by tweet or instagram post by press release or executive order,” mills said. “that’s just fundamental law, and i stand by the rule of law and separation of powers.”

administration officials have taken on the role of enforcers of trump’s enmity, retaliating against states, educational institutions, and private companies alike for real or perceived slights to the president and his agenda. the impact of those decisions has been far-reaching, threatening hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funding for defying his anti-trans executive orders and other agenda items. acting head of the social security administration leland dudek admitted in comments to the new york times this week that after seeing mills’ remarks to trump, he briefly ended electronic death reporting across the state and canceled a contract that allowed parents to register newborn babies for a social security number at maine hospitals. dudek said he reversed those decisions a few hours later, and had made them out of anger because he did not think mills was properly respectful to trump.

“i was ticked at the governor of maine for not being real cordial to the president,” dudek told the times. “i screwed up. i’ll admit i screwed up.”","['education', 'official', 'maine', 'declare', 'week', 'sign', 'compliance', 'agreement', 'trump', 'administration', 'continue', 'state', 'standoff', 'president', 'trump', 'political', 'fixation', 'transgender', 'girl', 'school', 'sport', 'march', 'department', 'health', 'human', 'service', 'hhs', 'state', 'press', 'release', 'maine', 'principal', 'association', 'maine', 'school', 'administrative', 'district', 'msad', 'violate', 'title', 'ix', 'civil', 'right', 'law', 'allow', 'tran', 'girl', 'compete', 'cisgender', 'girl', 'school', 'sport', 'league', 'release', 'say', 'entity', 'offer', 'opportunity', 'voluntarily', 'commit', 'day', 'resolve', 'matter', 'sign', 'agreement', 'risk', 'referral', 'department', 'justice', 'appropriate', 'action', 'principal', 'association', 'msad', 'board', 'director', 'sign', 'compliance', 'agreement', 'representative', 'say', 'week', 'statement', 'wmtw', 'principal', 'association', 'say', 'organization', 'continue', 'follow', 'maine', 'human', 'right', 'act', 'mhra', 'prohibit', 'education', 'discrimination', 'base', 'gender', 'identity', 'unable', 'sign', 'resolution', 'agreement', 'mandate', 'create', 'new', 'policy', 'violate', 'law', 'mhra', 'spokesperson', 'tell', 'wmtw', 'sign', 'sign', 'resolution', 'agreement', 'send', 'federal', 'department', 'health', 'human', 'service', 'msad', 'board', 'director', 'likewise', 'say', 'sign', 'hhs', 'agreement', 'mhra', 'letter', 'send', 'district', 'family', 'obtain', 'wmtw', 'district', 'include', 'greely', 'high', 'school', 'republican', 'maine', 'state', 'representative', 'laurel', 'libby', 'accuse', 'allow', 'trans', 'teen', 'compete', 'track', 'competition', 'month', 'libby', 'facebook', 'post', 'misgendere', 'potentially', 'publicly', 'identify', 'student', 'maine', 'house', 'representative', 'censure', 'libby', 'post', 'write', 'today', 'inform', 'community', 'msad', 'agree', 'propose', 'vra', 'send', 'district', 'board', 'director', 'write', 'wmtw', 'state', 'board', 'meeting', 'march', 'msad', 'continue', 'follow', 'state', 'law', 'maine', 'human', 'rights', 'act', 'mhra', 'compliance', 'propose', 'vra', 'violation', 'current', 'maine', 'law', 'board', 'recently', 'confer', 'legal', 'counsel', 'march', 'meeting', 'accord', 'board', 'public', 'agenda', 'detail', 'meeting', 'disclose', 'libby', 'facebook', 'post', 'target', 'greely', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'spark', 'major', 'feud', 'president', 'trump', 'maine', 'gov', 'janet', 'mills', 'february', 'mill', 'democrat', 'tell', 'trump', 'court', 'meeting', 'national', 'governor', 'association', 'white', 'house', 'trump', 'demand', 'defer', 'executive', 'order', 'purport', 'end', 'gender', 'ideology', 'federal', 'policy', 'follow', 'law', 'mill', 'say', 'time', 'executive', 'order', 'notably', 'law', 'multiple', 'federal', 'agency', 'immediately', 'open', 'investigation', 'state', 'hhs', 'investigation', 'state', 'department', 'education', 'last', 'calendar', 'day', 'hhs', 'official', 'expand', 'investigation', 'include', 'maine', 'principal', 'association', 'msad', 'early', 'march', 'post', 'majority', 'own', 'social', 'medium', 'platform', 'truth', 'social', 'week', 'trump', 'claim', 'receive', 'apology', 'state', 'maine', 'mill', 'defiance', 'clear', 'actual', 'apology', 'reference', 'deliver', 'wgme', 'note', 'week', 'apparently', 'mill', 'trump', 'demand', 'throate', 'apology', 'governor', 'post', 'statement', 'unlawful', 'challenge', 'federal', 'government', 'mill', 'ignore', 'trump', 'demand', 'apology', 'statement', 'obtain', 'wgme', 'monday', 'read', 'constitution', 'constitution', 'say', 'president', 'chief', 'executive', 'shall', 'care', 'law', 'faithfully', 'execute', 'allow', 'law', 'cloth', 'tweet', 'instagram', 'post', 'press', 'release', 'executive', 'order', 'mill', 'say', 'fundamental', 'law', 'stand', 'rule', 'law', 'separation', 'power', 'administration', 'official', 'take', 'role', 'enforcer', 'trump', 'enmity', 'retaliate', 'state', 'educational', 'institution', 'private', 'company', 'alike', 'real', 'perceive', 'slight', 'president', 'agenda', 'impact', 'decision', 'far', 'reach', 'threaten', 'hundred', 'million', 'dollar', 'federal', 'funding', 'defy', 'anti', 'trans', 'executive', 'order', 'agenda', 'item', 'act', 'head', 'social', 'security', 'administration', 'leland', 'dudek', 'admit', 'comment', 'new', 'york', 'times', 'week', 'see', 'mill', 'remark', 'trump', 'briefly', 'end', 'electronic', 'death', 'report', 'state', 'cancel', 'contract', 'allow', 'parent', 'register', 'newborn', 'baby', 'social', 'security', 'number', 'maine', 'hospital', 'dudek', 'say', 'reverse', 'decision', 'hour', 'later', 'anger', 'think', 'mill', 'properly', 'respectful', 'trump', 'tick', 'governor', 'maine', 'real', 'cordial', 'president', 'dudek', 'tell', 'time', 'screw', 'admit', 'screw']",

senate bill 440, or sb 440, prohibits public employers from requiring employees to use trans people’s preferred pronouns, and would also prohibit employers from being required to use trans workers’ preferred pronouns. the bill would also remove “nonbinary” as an option from job applications and other employment forms, and would make it illegal to require lgbtq+ cultural competence training.

lastly, the bill strengthens protections for homophobes and transphobes, specifying that it is unlawful for employers to take action against employees for “a belief in traditional or biblical views of sexuality and marriage, or the employee’s or contractor’s disagreement with gender ideology.”

the senate appeared to table sb 440 two weeks ago, after extensive pushback from the public, per the advocate. activists have dubbed the legislation the “don’t say gay or trans at work” bill, named after florida’s infamous 2022 “don’t say gay” bill that banned instruction on lgbtq+ topics in grades k-12 in public schools. according to the blog florida politics, over 1,000 public comment cards regarding the legislation were submitted, which led the committee to decline to hear the bill. but senators in the governmental oversight and accountability committee voted 5-2 in favor of sb 440 last tuesday, per florida politics.

florida state senator kristen arrington, a democrat who voted against the bill, told the advocate that the bill “really does promote government employees and contractors to harass transgender individuals by allowing them to intentionally misgender them by using disrespectful pronouns and having no consequences.” she added that it gave people “a license to discriminate free from accountability.”

“it seems that it’s [an] attempt to create a hostile work environment for lgbtq people, particularly transgender floridians,” arrington told the publication.

according to the advocate, the senate took up the bill again because of florida senator randy fine, who is currently running for congress as a candidate hand-picked by president donald trump. per the south florida sun sentinel, fine is looking to replace former u.s. house district 6 representative michael waltz, who is now trump’s head of national security. though fine did not introduce sb 440, he has introduced bills that aimed to ban rainbow flags from government buildings and ban children from drag shows.

the bill now moves to the senate judiciary committee.","['florida', 'senate', 'advance', 'bill', 'free', 'license', 'employer', 'misgender', 'transgender', 'nonbinary', 'employee', 'senate', 'bill', 'sb', 'prohibit', 'public', 'employer', 'require', 'employee', 'use', 'tran', 'people', 'prefer', 'pronoun', 'prohibit', 'employer', 'require', 'use', 'tran', 'worker', 'prefer', 'pronoun', 'bill', 'remove', 'nonbinary', 'option', 'job', 'application', 'employment', 'form', 'illegal', 'require', 'cultural', 'competence', 'training', 'lastly', 'bill', 'strengthen', 'protection', 'homophobe', 'transphobe', 'specify', 'unlawful', 'employer', 'action', 'employee', 'belief', 'traditional', 'biblical', 'view', 'sexuality', 'marriage', 'employee', 'contractor', 'disagreement', 'gender', 'ideology', 'senate', 'appear', 'table', 'sb', 'week', 'ago', 'extensive', 'pushback', 'public', 'advocate', 'activist', 'dub', 'legislation', 'gay', 'trans', 'work', 'bill', 'name', 'florida', 'infamous', 'gay', 'bill', 'ban', 'instruction', 'topic', 'grade', 'public', 'school', 'accord', 'blog', 'florida', 'politics', 'public', 'comment', 'card', 'legislation', 'submit', 'lead', 'committee', 'decline', 'hear', 'bill', 'senator', 'governmental', 'oversight', 'accountability', 'committee', 'vote', 'favor', 'sb', 'tuesday', 'florida', 'politic', 'florida', 'state', 'senator', 'kristen', 'arrington', 'democrat', 'vote', 'bill', 'tell', 'advocate', 'bill', 'promote', 'government', 'employee', 'contractor', 'harass', 'transgender', 'individual', 'allow', 'intentionally', 'misgender', 'disrespectful', 'pronoun', 'have', 'consequence', 'add', 'give', 'people', 'license', 'discriminate', 'free', 'accountability', 'attempt', 'create', 'hostile', 'work', 'environment', 'lgbtq', 'people', 'particularly', 'transgend', 'floridian', 'arrington', 'tell', 'publication', 'accord', 'advocate', 'senate', 'take', 'bill', 'florida', 'senator', 'randy', 'fine', 'currently', 'run', 'congress', 'candidate', 'hand', 'pick', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'south', 'florida', 'sun', 'sentinel', 'fine', 'look', 'replace', 'house', 'district', 'representative', 'michael', 'waltz', 'trump', 'head', 'national', 'security', 'fine', 'introduce', 'sb', 'introduce', 'bill', 'aim', 'ban', 'rainbow', 'flag', 'government', 'building', 'ban', 'child', 'drag', 'show', 'bill', 'move', 'senate', 'judiciary', 'committee']",

the project is a collaboration between actress and producer madison and naesm, inc., an atlanta-based nonprofit and one of the oldest black-led hiv/aids service organizations in the south. the home is part of a new way of life’s safe housing network, a national collective providing safe reentry housing to formerly incarcerated people, and will welcome up to four women at a time, according to local outlet the atlanta voice.

madison first announced the house’s opening at last year’s naesm conference. she told gaye magazine that when she moved out of the house, she decided to repurpose it to help support and foster community for other black trans women.

“i wanted to use this house as a conduit for girls to become great,” she said. “i was a girl that was disenfranchised and homeless and was in sex work, and so many great things have happened in this house… i want people to understand that it’s not where you start, it’s where you go.”

naesm, inc.’s official website describes the ts madison starter house as “a transformative investment in the future of black trans women.”

“we are building a model of care, economic empowerment, and long-term sustainability that ensures black trans people have access to safe housing, affirming healthcare, economic opportunities, and holistic support,” the website continues.

in partnership with naesm, the house will offer its residents healthcare, wellness services, psychological support, and workshops focusing on project management and business plan development. residents of the house are referred to as “stakeholders,” in reference to their own role in the larger black queer and trans liberation movement, per black enterprise.


a 2011 national lgbtq task force survey found that half (47%) of black transgender people have been incarcerated at some point in their lives, compared to 16% of trans people and 21% of trans women in general. these incarceration rates are driven by black trans people being disproportionately impacted by economic instability. according to the 2015 u.s. transgender survey, black trans americans face an unemployment rate (20%) four times higher than the general population and a poverty rate (38%) three times higher than the general population.

“in the face of erasure, we still find solutions,” trans actress and activist monroe alise said during the house’s grand opening, per the atlanta voice. “they are trying to erase black trans and nonbinary individuals throughout the country, the 1%. it really isn’t about us, but they’re just starting with us. in this time, we must come together, stand together, and be more visible than ever.”","['year', 'transgender', 'day', 'visibility', 'mark', 'grand', 'opening', 'ts', 'madison', 'starter', 'house', 'landmark', 'new', 'reentry', 'home', 'incarcerate', 'black', 'tran', 'woman', 'atlanta', 'georgia', 'project', 'collaboration', 'actress', 'producer', 'madison', 'naesm', 'inc', 'atlanta', 'base', 'nonprofit', 'old', 'black', 'lead', 'hiv', 'aids', 'service', 'organization', 'south', 'home', 'new', 'way', 'life', 'safe', 'housing', 'network', 'national', 'collective', 'provide', 'safe', 'reentry', 'housing', 'incarcerate', 'people', 'welcome', 'woman', 'time', 'accord', 'local', 'outlet', 'atlanta', 'voice', 'madison', 'announce', 'house', 'opening', 'year', 'naesm', 'conference', 'tell', 'gaye', 'magazine', 'move', 'house', 'decide', 'repurpose', 'help', 'support', 'foster', 'community', 'black', 'tran', 'woman', 'want', 'use', 'house', 'conduit', 'girl', 'great', 'say', 'girl', 'disenfranchised', 'homeless', 'sex', 'work', 'great', 'thing', 'happen', 'house', 'want', 'people', 'understand', 'start', 'naesm', 'inc', 'official', 'website', 'describe', 'ts', 'madison', 'starter', 'house', 'transformative', 'investment', 'future', 'black', 'tran', 'woman', 'build', 'model', 'care', 'economic', 'empowerment', 'long', 'term', 'sustainability', 'ensure', 'black', 'tran', 'people', 'access', 'safe', 'housing', 'affirm', 'healthcare', 'economic', 'opportunity', 'holistic', 'support', 'website', 'continue', 'partnership', 'naesm', 'house', 'offer', 'resident', 'healthcare', 'wellness', 'service', 'psychological', 'support', 'workshop', 'focus', 'project', 'management', 'business', 'plan', 'development', 'resident', 'house', 'refer', 'stakeholder', 'reference', 'role', 'large', 'black', 'queer', 'tran', 'liberation', 'movement', 'black', 'enterprise', 'national', 'lgbtq', 'task', 'force', 'survey', 'find', 'half', 'black', 'transgender', 'people', 'incarcerate', 'point', 'life', 'compare', 'trans', 'people', 'trans', 'woman', 'general', 'incarceration', 'rate', 'drive', 'black', 'tran', 'people', 'disproportionately', 'impact', 'economic', 'instability', 'accord', 'transgender', 'survey', 'black', 'tran', 'americans', 'face', 'unemployment', 'rate', 'time', 'high', 'general', 'population', 'poverty', 'rate', 'time', 'high', 'general', 'population', 'face', 'erasure', 'find', 'solution', 'trans', 'actress', 'activist', 'monroe', 'alise', 'say', 'house', 'grand', 'opening', 'atlanta', 'voice', 'try', 'erase', 'black', 'tran', 'nonbinary', 'individual', 'country', 'start', 'time', 'come', 'stand', 'visible']",
14ba7222-4b59-493f-9022-d06847bf4ba6,pro,texas attorney general wants to depose school officials over trans athlete policies,"['texas', 'attorney', 'general', 'want', 'depose', 'school', 'official', 'trans', 'athlete', 'policy']",them,abby monteil,https://www.them.us/story/texas-attorney-ken-paxton-depose-dallas-school-officials-trans-athletes,4/1/2025,"texas attorney general ken paxton wants to question dallas independent school district (dallas isd) officials under oath about their district’s transgender athlete policies as part of his latest anti-trans attack.

on monday, paxton announced via a press release that he will depose several dallas isd employees, including dallas isd superintendent stephanie elizalde, lgbt youth program coordinator mahoganie gaston, and members of the district’s board of trustees.

in february, paxton’s office requested records from dallas isd and another school district, irving isd, after viewing videos that the conservative group accuracy in media secretly filmed and published of school administrators allegedly suggesting that trans student athletes could participate in sports aligning with their gender if their parents updated their birth certificates.

media matters describes accuracy in media as “a conservative media criticism organization that has a history of pushing anti-lgbtq views and conspiracy theories.”

although texas’ state department barred trans texans from updating the sex listed on their birth certificates last september, only eight states prohibit gender marker amendments entirely. in one video filmed without gaston’s knowledge, an accuracy in media member poses as the parent of a trans daughter who is considering moving to texas and wants to know if her daughter would be allowed to play on a girls’ soccer team.

texas currently bars trans athletes in k-12 schools and public texas colleges from competing in categories that do not correspond with their assigned sex at birth. even if a student were to change the gender on their birth certificate they wouldn’t be allowed to play, because state law only recognizes changes to birth certificates that result from clerical error. however, it’s unclear how schools are meant to determine whether or not a birth certificate has been modified.

in the video from accuracy in media, gaston appears to suggest that this “parent” could use an updated birth certificate in hopes of helping her daughter play on a girls’ soccer team.

“[the state] said birth certificate,” she says. “they didn’t say ‘original’ or ‘updated’... they find the loopholes in everything.”

later, gaston emphasizes that she’s dedicated to looking out for lgbtq+ students, adding, “i tell people all the time, i will go to jail for saving their child’s life. i guess no conservative kids come out gay.”

dallas isd issued its own statement confirming that the school district is aware of paxton’s pre-suit request for depositions.

“we are cooperating with the attorney general’s office to provide information that confirms dallas isd’s ongoing compliance with federal and state laws,” the statement continued, per local news outlet wfaa. “the district is committed to continue following both the spirit and intent of the law.”

on march 4, gaston’s friend farris steel started a gofundme to help cover her basic living expenses while she searches for a new job. according to steel, dallas isd terminated gaston’s employment after she faced harassment and doxxing in the aftermath of accuracy in media’s video being posted online.

“mahoganie is an unwavering ally, deeply committed to the belief that her liberation is bound to the liberation of lgbtq+ people,” steel’s gofundme page reads. “[...] these attacks are meant to silence educators and enact a chilling effect on lgbtq+ inclusion in schools. but mahoganie remains undaunted: she is ready to keep fighting.”

these deposition requests are only the latest development in paxton’s obsession with targeting trans student athletes. in february, he sued the national collegiate athletic association (ncaa) on behalf of the state of texas, demanding that the organization conduct “sex screenings” of student athletes to ensure that trans women are not allowed to compete in sporting events that align with their gender. this move came even after the ncaa banned trans women from competing in women’s sports.

at the time, paxton claimed that the ncaa is not complying with donald trump’s february 5 executive order, derisively titled “keep men out of women’s sports.” the order itself does not have the power to immediately ban trans women and girls from sports nationwide, although it does threaten to “rescind all funds from educational programs” that allow trans girls to participate in girls’ sports.","['texas', 'attorney', 'general', 'ken', 'paxton', 'want', 'question', 'dallas', 'independent', 'school', 'district', 'dallas', 'isd', 'official', 'oath', 'district', 'transgender', 'athlete', 'policy', 'late', 'anti', 'trans', 'attack', 'monday', 'paxton', 'announce', 'press', 'release', 'depose', 'dalla', 'isd', 'employee', 'include', 'dallas', 'isd', 'superintendent', 'stephanie', 'elizalde', 'lgbt', 'youth', 'program', 'coordinator', 'mahoganie', 'gaston', 'member', 'district', 'board', 'trustee', 'february', 'paxton', 'office', 'request', 'record', 'dallas', 'isd', 'school', 'district', 'irving', 'isd', 'view', 'video', 'conservative', 'group', 'accuracy', 'medium', 'secretly', 'film', 'publish', 'school', 'administrator', 'allegedly', 'suggest', 'trans', 'student', 'athlete', 'participate', 'sport', 'align', 'gender', 'parent', 'update', 'birth', 'certificate', 'medium', 'matter', 'describe', 'accuracy', 'medium', 'conservative', 'medium', 'criticism', 'organization', 'history', 'push', 'anti', 'lgbtq', 'view', 'conspiracy', 'theory', 'texas', 'state', 'department', 'bar', 'tran', 'texans', 'update', 'sex', 'list', 'birth', 'certificate', 'september', 'state', 'prohibit', 'gender', 'marker', 'amendment', 'entirely', 'video', 'film', 'gaston', 'knowledge', 'accuracy', 'media', 'member', 'pose', 'parent', 'trans', 'daughter', 'consider', 'move', 'texas', 'want', 'know', 'daughter', 'allow', 'play', 'girl', 'soccer', 'team', 'texas', 'currently', 'bar', 'tran', 'athlete', 'school', 'public', 'texas', 'college', 'compete', 'category', 'correspond', 'assign', 'sex', 'birth', 'student', 'change', 'gender', 'birth', 'certificate', 'allow', 'play', 'state', 'law', 'recognize', 'change', 'birth', 'certificate', 'result', 'clerical', 'error', 'unclear', 'school', 'mean', 'determine', 'birth', 'certificate', 'modify', 'video', 'accuracy', 'medium', 'gaston', 'appear', 'suggest', 'parent', 'use', 'update', 'birth', 'certificate', 'hope', 'help', 'daughter', 'play', 'girl', 'soccer', 'team', 'state', 'say', 'birth', 'certificate', 'say', 'original', 'update', 'find', 'loophole', 'later', 'gaston', 'emphasize', 'dedicate', 'look', 'student', 'add', 'tell', 'people', 'time', 'jail', 'save', 'child', 'life', 'guess', 'conservative', 'kid', 'come', 'gay', 'dallas', 'isd', 'issue', 'statement', 'confirm', 'school', 'district', 'aware', 'paxton', 'pre', 'suit', 'request', 'deposition', 'cooperate', 'attorney', 'general', 'office', 'provide', 'information', 'confirm', 'dallas', 'isd', 'ongoing', 'compliance', 'federal', 'state', 'law', 'statement', 'continue', 'local', 'news', 'outlet', 'wfaa', 'district', 'commit', 'continue', 'follow', 'spirit', 'intent', 'law', 'march', 'gaston', 'friend', 'farris', 'steel', 'start', 'gofundme', 'help', 'cover', 'basic', 'living', 'expense', 'search', 'new', 'job', 'accord', 'steel', 'dallas', 'isd', 'terminate', 'gaston', 'employment', 'face', 'harassment', 'doxxe', 'aftermath', 'accuracy', 'medium', 'video', 'post', 'online', 'mahoganie', 'unwavering', 'ally', 'deeply', 'committed', 'belief', 'liberation', 'bind', 'liberation', 'people', 'steel', 'gofundme', 'page', 'read', 'attack', 'mean', 'silence', 'educator', 'enact', 'chilling', 'effect', 'inclusion', 'school', 'mahoganie', 'remain', 'undaunted', 'ready', 'fight', 'deposition', 'request', 'late', 'development', 'paxton', 'obsession', 'target', 'trans', 'student', 'athlete', 'february', 'sue', 'national', 'collegiate', 'athletic', 'association', 'ncaa', 'behalf', 'state', 'texas', 'demand', 'organization', 'conduct', 'sex', 'screening', 'student', 'athlete', 'ensure', 'trans', 'woman', 'allow', 'compete', 'sporting', 'event', 'align', 'gender', 'come', 'ncaa', 'ban', 'tran', 'woman', 'compete', 'woman', 'sport', 'time', 'paxton', 'claim', 'ncaa', 'comply', 'donald', 'trump', 'february', 'executive', 'order', 'derisively', 'title', 'man', 'woman', 'sport', 'order', 'power', 'immediately', 'ban', 'trans', 'woman', 'girl', 'sport', 'nationwide', 'threaten', 'rescind', 'fund', 'educational', 'program', 'allow', 'tran', 'girl', 'participate', 'girl', 'sport']",

assembly bills 89 and 844 were the subject of a tuesday hearing in the california assembly arts, entertainment, sports, and tourism committee. ab 89, introduced by republican assembly member kate sanchez, would have compelled the california interscholastic federation (which governs high school sports in the state) to “prohibit a pupil whose sex was assigned male at birth from participating on a girls’ interscholastic sports team.” ab 844, introduced by republican assembly member bill essayli, would have likewise amended the state education code to remove language allowing students to access school facilities “consistent with his or her gender identity.”

instead, access would have been restricted “based upon the pupil’s sex,” a change which would have affected colleges as well as public k-12 schools. ab 844 also would have defined “sex” based on whether a person’s body produces eggs or sperm, or “would have” produced such cells for children with intersex traits, further marginalizing and legally erasing intersex people. both bills failed on party-line votes, nbc affiliate kcra reported on tuesday.

unusually, several conservatives quoted newsom’s recent remarks about trans women athletes to bolster their arguments for the bills. newsom kicked off a new podcast in march by hosting far-right pundits including charlie kirk, michael savage, and steve bannon, with newsom ceding to kirk that allowing trans women and girls in women’s sports is “deeply unfair.” research has not supported that claim, and one study backed by the international olympic committee last year indicated that trans women may actually face disadvantages in some athletic metrics.

“even governor gavin newsom, widely considered one of the most pro-lgbtq governors in our state’s history, said recently, ‘it’s an issue of fairness,’” sanchez said in support of her bill during the hearing. “for the first time ever, gavin newsom and i agree,” concurred karen england of the anti-lgbtq+ “religious liberty” group capitol research institute.

sophia lara, outreach director for the california family council — a right-wing christian advocacy nonprofit which has said it is “thrilled” to be known as an anti-lgbtq+ hate group — also quoted similar remarks by newsom on real time with bill maher. during public comment, one person who identified herself as a mother stated that “[j]ust as governor newsom, i support [ab] 844 to protect girls from predatory boys and their actions in the locker room.” (newsom did not publicly endorse either bill.)

newsom’s office refused kcra’s request for comment following the hearing, saying only that the governor would not comment on pending legislation, although both bills are now dead. assembly speaker robert rivas, who addressed the committee to oppose both bills, also declined to comment on tuesday.

“instead of tackling the real problems in our state like high inflation and rising healthcare costs, assemblymembers sanchez and essayli continue to waste time and taxpayer money using transgender youth as political pawns in a shameful display of divisive politics and a thirst for attention,” said tony hoang, executive director of the lgbtq+ advocacy group equality california, in a statement tuesday. “ab 89 and ab 844 are part of the nationwide coordinated effort led by extremists in washington d.c. to sow fear and misinformation about transgender people — in particular youth — and attempt to erase them from virtually all areas of public life.”

last week, secretary of education linda mcmahon sent a letter to newsom’s office declaring that california would lose federal funds if it did not outlaw trans girls and women from women’s sports. that threat is the latest attempt by the trump administration to strong-arm states into compliance with its anti-trans agenda by withholding funds, amid an ongoing feud between the president and maine gov. janet mills.","['california', 'bill', 'bar', 'transgender', 'girl', 'school', 'sport', 'league', 'change', 'facility', 'die', 'committee', 'tuesday', 'follow', 'hearing', 'find', 'republican', 'approvingly', 'quote', 'democrat', 'gov', 'gavin', 'newsom', 'podcast', 'assembly', 'bill', 'subject', 'tuesday', 'hearing', 'california', 'assembly', 'art', 'entertainment', 'sport', 'tourism', 'committee', 'ab', 'introduce', 'republican', 'assembly', 'member', 'kate', 'sanchez', 'compel', 'california', 'interscholastic', 'federation', 'govern', 'high', 'school', 'sport', 'state', 'prohibit', 'pupil', 'sex', 'assign', 'male', 'birth', 'participate', 'girl', 'interscholastic', 'sport', 'team', 'ab', 'introduce', 'republican', 'assembly', 'member', 'bill', 'essayli', 'likewise', 'amend', 'state', 'education', 'code', 'remove', 'language', 'allow', 'student', 'access', 'school', 'facility', 'consistent', 'gender', 'identity', 'instead', 'access', 'restrict', 'base', 'pupil', 'sex', 'change', 'affect', 'college', 'public', 'school', 'ab', 'define', 'sex', 'base', 'person', 'body', 'produce', 'egg', 'sperm', 'produce', 'cell', 'child', 'intersex', 'trait', 'marginalize', 'legally', 'erase', 'intersex', 'people', 'bill', 'fail', 'party', 'line', 'vote', 'nbc', 'affiliate', 'kcra', 'report', 'tuesday', 'unusually', 'conservative', 'quote', 'newsom', 'recent', 'remark', 'trans', 'woman', 'athlete', 'bolster', 'argument', 'bill', 'newsom', 'kick', 'new', 'podcast', 'march', 'host', 'far', 'right', 'pundit', 'include', 'charlie', 'kirk', 'michael', 'savage', 'steve', 'bannon', 'newsom', 'cede', 'kirk', 'allow', 'trans', 'woman', 'girl', 'woman', 'sport', 'deeply', 'unfair', 'research', 'support', 'claim', 'study', 'back', 'international', 'olympic', 'committee', 'year', 'indicate', 'trans', 'woman', 'actually', 'face', 'disadvantage', 'athletic', 'metric', 'governor', 'gavin', 'newsom', 'widely', 'consider', 'pro', 'lgbtq', 'governor', 'state', 'history', 'say', 'recently', 'issue', 'fairness', 'sanchez', 'say', 'support', 'bill', 'hearing', 'time', 'gavin', 'newsom', 'agree', 'concur', 'karen', 'england', 'anti', 'religious', 'liberty', 'group', 'capitol', 'research', 'institute', 'sophia', 'lara', 'outreach', 'director', 'california', 'family', 'council', 'right', 'wing', 'christian', 'advocacy', 'nonprofit', 'say', 'thrill', 'know', 'anti', 'hate', 'group', 'quote', 'similar', 'remark', 'newsom', 'real', 'time', 'bill', 'maher', 'public', 'comment', 'person', 'identify', 'mother', 'state', 'governor', 'newsom', 'support', 'ab', 'protect', 'girl', 'predatory', 'boy', 'action', 'locker', 'room', 'newsom', 'publicly', 'endorse', 'bill', 'newsom', 'office', 'refuse', 'kcra', 'request', 'comment', 'follow', 'hearing', 'say', 'governor', 'comment', 'pende', 'legislation', 'bill', 'dead', 'assembly', 'speaker', 'robert', 'rivas', 'address', 'committee', 'oppose', 'bill', 'decline', 'comment', 'tuesday', 'instead', 'tackle', 'real', 'problem', 'state', 'like', 'high', 'inflation', 'rise', 'healthcare', 'cost', 'assemblymember', 'sanchez', 'essayli', 'continue', 'waste', 'time', 'taxpayer', 'money', 'transgend', 'youth', 'political', 'pawn', 'shameful', 'display', 'divisive', 'politic', 'thirst', 'attention', 'say', 'tony', 'hoang', 'executive', 'director', 'advocacy', 'group', 'equality', 'california', 'statement', 'tuesday', 'ab', 'ab', 'nationwide', 'coordinated', 'effort', 'lead', 'extremist', 'washington', 'sow', 'fear', 'misinformation', 'transgender', 'people', 'particular', 'youth', 'attempt', 'erase', 'virtually', 'area', 'public', 'life', 'week', 'secretary', 'education', 'linda', 'mcmahon', 'send', 'letter', 'newsom', 'office', 'declare', 'california', 'lose', 'federal', 'fund', 'outlaw', 'trans', 'girl', 'woman', 'woman', 'sport', 'threat', 'late', 'attempt', 'trump', 'administration', 'strong', 'arm', 'state', 'compliance', 'anti', 'trans', 'agenda', 'withholding', 'fund', 'amid', 'ongoing', 'feud', 'president', 'maine', 'gov', 'janet', 'mill']",
8e8ba6ae-bf5e-436c-bd4a-964097e3c069,pro,usa fencing disqualified a cis athlete who refused to compete against a trans woman,"['usa', 'fencing', 'disqualify', 'cis', 'athlete', 'refuse', 'compete', 'trans', 'woman']",them,samantha riedel,https://www.them.us/story/usa-fencing-redmond-sullivan-stephanie-turner-jk-rowling-disqualified-cis-athlete,4/3/2025,"usa fencing says it is standing by its decision to disqualify a cisgender fencer who forfeited a tournament match against a transgender opponent last week, an act the organization says violated international competition rules.

on march 30, usa fencing (the country’s governing body for youth and adult competitive fencing) oversaw the annual cherry blossom tournament at the university of maryland. during the division 1 women’s foil event, cis fencer stephanie turner knelt in front of her opponent redmond sullivan, removed her protective mask, and refused to begin the match. a referee then showed turner a black card to disqualify her.

a black card is the harshest penalty in fencing, one that is usually deployed in cases of egregious unsportsmanlike conduct. in a statement to the irish star this week, usa fencing said that turner’s conduct violated rules for competition set by the international fencing federation (fie).

“[turner’s] disqualification was not related to any personal statement but was merely the direct result of her decision to decline to fence an eligible opponent, which the fie rules clearly prohibit,” usa fencing’s statement read in part. fie’s technical rules bar athletes from competing if they “refuse to fence against any other fencer whatsoever [...] correctly entered in the event.”

“usa fencing is obligated to follow the letter of those rules and ensure that participants respect the standards set at the international level,” the organization’s statement continued. “we remain committed to inclusivity within our sport while also upholding every requirement dictated by our governing body.”

usa fencing also told the star that it will “always err on the side of inclusion,” but that its leaders “respect the viewpoints on all sides” and would consider changing their trans and nonbinary athlete policy should olympic policies change or new “relevant evidence-based research” be conducted. the organization’s current policy allows adult trans and nonbinary people to compete in men’s or women’s divisions depending on their stated gender identity, with restrictions based on an athlete’s testosterone levels; trans women must complete a year of testosterone suppression to be eligible for women’s competition, while trans men who take testosterone are automatically disqualified from women’s events.

sullivan went on to finish 24th overall in the field of 39 competitors (including turner), with seasoned competitor shuang li picking up the fifth gold medal of her career. of course, li received no accolades from right-wing media outlets, much less self-proclaimed defender of women’s sports j.k. rowling, who focused on denigrating sullivan and uplifting turner on elon musk’s x social media platform. rowling wrote in one post that turner is “what a heroine looks like,” after sharing another post from former tennis star turned anti-trans campaigner martina navratilova, who said she was “fuming” and shamed usa fencing for “throw[ing] women under the gender bullshit bus.”

current scientific research has not shown that trans women hold significant biological advantages over cis women in competitive sports. in fact, a study backed by the international olympic committee last year found that trans women who suppress their testosterone may face significant disadvantages in some athletic metrics like vertical leap. but conservatives in the u.s. have insisted that it is “common sense” to ban trans women and girls from women’s sports, which has now become a rallying cry for the second trump administration, as officials use trans athletes as a cudgel to withhold funding from states like maine by claiming they are violating federal civil rights law.

in 2022, the ncaa tightened restrictions on trans athletes’ eligibility following the success of then-college swimmer lia thomas. ncaa president charlie baker said in february that the organization would voluntarily shift its policies to align with trump’s executive order calling for sports to be separated based on the president’s definition of “biological sex.” the new participation policy specifically states that a “student-athlete assigned male at birth may not compete for an ncaa women's team.” it’s not clear based on usa fencing’s statement this week whether the organization will alter its own policy to match the ncaa updates.","['usa', 'fencing', 'say', 'stand', 'decision', 'disqualify', 'cisgender', 'fencer', 'forfeit', 'tournament', 'match', 'transgender', 'opponent', 'week', 'act', 'organization', 'say', 'violate', 'international', 'competition', 'rule', 'march', 'usa', 'fencing', 'country', 'govern', 'body', 'youth', 'adult', 'competitive', 'fencing', 'oversee', 'annual', 'cherry', 'blossom', 'tournament', 'university', 'maryland', 'division', 'woman', 'foil', 'event', 'cis', 'fencer', 'stephanie', 'turner', 'kneel', 'opponent', 'redmond', 'sullivan', 'remove', 'protective', 'mask', 'refuse', 'begin', 'match', 'referee', 'show', 'turner', 'black', 'card', 'disqualify', 'black', 'card', 'harsh', 'penalty', 'fencing', 'usually', 'deploy', 'case', 'egregious', 'unsportsmanlike', 'conduct', 'statement', 'irish', 'star', 'week', 'usa', 'fencing', 'say', 'turner', 'conduct', 'violate', 'rule', 'competition', 'set', 'international', 'fencing', 'federation', 'fie', 'turner', 'disqualification', 'relate', 'personal', 'statement', 'merely', 'direct', 'result', 'decision', 'decline', 'fence', 'eligible', 'opponent', 'fie', 'rule', 'clearly', 'prohibit', 'usa', 'fencing', 'statement', 'read', 'fie', 'technical', 'rule', 'bar', 'athlete', 'compete', 'refuse', 'fence', 'fencer', 'whatsoever', 'correctly', 'enter', 'event', 'usa', 'fencing', 'obligate', 'follow', 'letter', 'rule', 'ensure', 'participant', 'respect', 'standard', 'set', 'international', 'level', 'organization', 'statement', 'continue', 'remain', 'committed', 'inclusivity', 'sport', 'uphold', 'requirement', 'dictate', 'govern', 'body', 'usa', 'fencing', 'tell', 'star', 'err', 'inclusion', 'leader', 'respect', 'viewpoint', 'side', 'consider', 'change', 'tran', 'nonbinary', 'athlete', 'policy', 'olympic', 'policy', 'change', 'new', 'relevant', 'evidence', 'base', 'research', 'conduct', 'organization', 'current', 'policy', 'allow', 'adult', 'trans', 'nonbinary', 'people', 'compete', 'man', 'woman', 'division', 'depend', 'state', 'gender', 'identity', 'restriction', 'base', 'athlete', 'testosterone', 'level', 'trans', 'woman', 'complete', 'year', 'testosterone', 'suppression', 'eligible', 'woman', 'competition', 'trans', 'man', 'testosterone', 'automatically', 'disqualify', 'woman', 'event', 'sullivan', 'go', 'finish', 'overall', 'field', 'competitor', 'include', 'turner', 'seasoned', 'competitor', 'shuang', 'li', 'pick', 'fifth', 'gold', 'medal', 'career', 'course', 'li', 'receive', 'accolade', 'right', 'wing', 'medium', 'outlet', 'self', 'proclaim', 'defender', 'woman', 'sports', 'rowling', 'focus', 'denigrate', 'sullivan', 'uplift', 'turner', 'elon', 'musk', 'x', 'social', 'medium', 'platform', 'rowling', 'write', 'post', 'turner', 'heroine', 'look', 'like', 'share', 'post', 'tennis', 'star', 'turn', 'anti', 'trans', 'campaigner', 'martina', 'navratilova', 'say', 'fume', 'shame', 'usa', 'fence', 'woman', 'gender', 'bullshit', 'bus', 'current', 'scientific', 'research', 'show', 'trans', 'woman', 'hold', 'significant', 'biological', 'advantage', 'cis', 'woman', 'competitive', 'sport', 'fact', 'study', 'back', 'international', 'olympic', 'committee', 'year', 'find', 'trans', 'woman', 'suppress', 'testosterone', 'face', 'significant', 'disadvantage', 'athletic', 'metric', 'like', 'vertical', 'leap', 'conservative', 'insist', 'common', 'sense', 'ban', 'trans', 'woman', 'girl', 'woman', 'sport', 'rallying', 'cry', 'second', 'trump', 'administration', 'official', 'use', 'trans', 'athlete', 'cudgel', 'withhold', 'funding', 'state', 'like', 'maine', 'claim', 'violate', 'federal', 'civil', 'right', 'law', 'ncaa', 'tighten', 'restriction', 'trans', 'athlete', 'eligibility', 'follow', 'success', 'college', 'swimmer', 'lia', 'thomas', 'ncaa', 'president', 'charlie', 'baker', 'say', 'february', 'organization', 'voluntarily', 'shift', 'policy', 'align', 'trump', 'executive', 'order', 'call', 'sport', 'separate', 'base', 'president', 'definition', 'biological', 'sex', 'new', 'participation', 'policy', 'specifically', 'state', 'student', 'athlete', 'assign', 'male', 'birth', 'compete', 'ncaa', 'woman', 'team', 'clear', 'base', 'usa', 'fencing', 'statement', 'week', 'organization', 'alter', 'policy', 'match', 'ncaa', 'update']",
2925669a-4a04-4cfc-b7f6-06808738bb40,pro,trans athlete cammie woodman barred from nyc tennis league after a cis woman lost to her and complained,"['trans', 'athlete', 'cammie', 'woodman', 'bar', 'nyc', 'tennis', 'league', 'cis', 'woman', 'lose', 'complain']",them,nico lang,https://www.them.us/story/trans-athlete-cammie-woodman-tennis-league-new-york-city-complaint-removed,4/3/2025,"a brooklyn transgender woman is mulling legal action against a new york city tennis league after she was barred from competing against other women following a complaint from a cisgender woman in the league.

cammie woodman, 25, says that the tennis league network’s founder and ceo, steven chagnon, asked if he could move her to an “appropriate level men’s division” in a march 26 email. chagnon had forwarded her a separate email from the cisgender woman whom woodman had beaten in a match the day prior. the woman referred to woodman as a “male playing in a women’s league.”

“i’m aware how controversial this issue is right now and i am sorry to put this on you but i don’t think there’s a way around the fact that it’s unfair for me, or any other woman in this league, to play against a man under the pretense that he is a woman,” the email read.

less than two hours after receiving the message and the forwarded complaint, woodman replied to chagnon, refusing his suggestion that she compete against men. “unfortunately, no, i am a transgender woman who has been medically transitioning for the past 4 years and can provide proof of this,” she said in her reply. “i believe in my integrity as a woman player, as i play women often and would not say that i dominate the competition by any means. i compete in local women’s tournaments, and frankly, i have a mostly losing record. … if you decide that i cannot participate, i will take my money back.”

chagnon responded a few hours later. “whatever this is,” he wrote, “we have zero interest in being involved. everyone who is connected is getting refunded immediately and removed from the program.”

reading that email, woodman says, it was as if her “worst nightmare” was coming true. she had read press coverage of other athletes facing mistreatment and exclusion for being trans. the moral panic about trans girls and women playing sports has reached such a fever pitch, stoked by right-wing pundits, activists, lawmakers, and elected officials, that even cisgender athletes like olympic gold medalist imane khelif and zambian soccer player barbra banda, a striker for the orlando pride, have been “accused” of being trans, subjected to harassment and bullying from everyday trolls and high-profile transphobes alike. woodman knew that the campaign of exclusion could come for her someday. she just didn’t think it would be that particular day.

“i had a physical reaction where i was crying and my legs were shaking,” she tells them, of seeing chagnon’s words on her screen. “it was hard to stand. i felt like i could have been pushed over. you could have knocked me down with a feather. it was unbelievable.”

the experience was particularly jarring, woodman says, because the actual match had been a pleasant one. her competitor seemed inexperienced, and after woodman beat her handily in 6-0, 6-2 sets, she says the two shook hands and exchanged light pleasantries. woodman, who has been training for the past two and a half years, even offered to practice with her opponent in the future. “i felt like this player wasn’t at a level that was appropriate for the league in general, whether it was against me or any of the other girls,” she tells them over the phone.

having begun playing tennis relatively early in her transition, woodman feels that tennis is a lot like life, in that the biggest adversary you’re facing is yourself. “if you lose a match in tennis, it’s because of your own errors or something that you’ve done, rather than someone just being too good,” she says. “i find that so inspirational. all we can focus on is what we have control over and what power we still have.”

woodman wasn’t the only player who was impacted by the tennis league network’s decision to ban her from play. other competitors who emailed on her behalf to protest the organization’s move were also punished, per emails from the tennis league network reviewed by them.

in that second email to woodman, chagnon said that “everyone who is connected” to the incident would be “removed from the program,” but woodman believes that the woman who initially complained remains active in the league. (them could not independently confirm that claim, as chagnon and the tennis league network did not return numerous requests for comment.)

among those who say they were also ejected from the league is mel o’brien, 30, who received a separate email from chagnon stating that tennis league network is “just a tennis league and we’re not interested.” “if there is another account involved, please let us know and we’ll also just refund your fees,” he wrote in the march 26 message.

o’brien says that she does not regret sticking up for woodman, whom she calls one of the most dedicated competitors that she’s ever met. after playing alongside woodman for years on the courts, o’brien says that she spoke out on her friend’s behalf because what woodman was experiencing was “very clearly discriminatory.” she felt like she had a responsibility to say something, and she hopes that anyone else in her shoes would do the exact same thing.

“it’s hard to find someone who’s so dedicated to improving themselves in tennis,” o’brien tells them. “every time cammie steps on the court, she is playing at 110%. she puts so much into it, and she’s such a kind person. no one deserves this kind of treatment, and cammie, in particular, definitely did not deserve this type of treatment.”

the incident drew national attention after woodman shared screenshots of her exchange with chagnon in a march 29 instagram post calling on municipal officials to take action against tennis league network for “violating nyc human rights law.” since 2002, the new york city human rights law has prohibited “discriminatory harassment or violence motivated by a person’s actual or perceived gender, gender identity, or gender expression” in virtually all areas of public life, which would include recreational sports leagues. (the state has also had its own comprehensive trans civil rights law on the books since 2019.)

the tennis league network oversees 44 chapters in communities all over the country and bills itself as “america's recreational tennis playing population.” the recreational league matches participants with other local players of similar skill levels. chagnon has not responded to inquiries from multiple media outlets that have covered the story. although the network’s national website lists rules of play, there is no mention of any policy affecting trans players. similarly, the rules listed on the website for the organization’s brooklyn chapter make no mention of policies impacting trans players. its website does note, however, that all the partners within the tennis league network’s purview are non-competitive, and there is no cash reward or prize for winning.

but by operating within new york city, the tennis league network is obligated to follow local and state nondiscrimination ordinances. although new york city officials have not commented on the specifics of woodman’s case, a spokesperson for the new york city commission on human rights (nycchr) told them that the city is “widely considered to have the broadest anti-discrimination protections in the country, safeguarding human rights for over 25 categories, including gender and gender identity, in housing, employment, and public accommodations.” in a statement emailed to them, the nychhr representative invited any individuals who have personally witnessed anti-trans bias to contact the agency.

meanwhile, the new york city’s parks department, which oversees all public tennis courts in the five boroughs, said in an email that “discrimination has no place in our city.” “our public parks are spaces where all new yorkers and visitors should feel welcome,” a parks department representative told them, noting that it has not yet renewed tennis league network’s permits to use its facilities in 2025.

woodman confirmed that she is considering filing a complaint against the tennis league network, although she has yet to pursue any specific form of litigation. one of her prime motivations in doing so, she says, is to warn other trans people that, if this could happen to her, it could happen to anyone. although the new york metropolitan area is often viewed as a liberal bubble, its progressivism is not absolute: the city school district of the city of new york debated a policy in march 2024 that would potentially restrict trans student athletics access, while long island’s nassau county enacted the state’s first trans sports ban three months later.

“people need to know that this is happening and in a place where people would think they’d be safe, like brooklyn,” woodman says. “no trans athlete is safe from this kind of discrimination.”

the scrutiny trans athletes face has only increased under the new presidential administration. since taking office for his second term in january, u.s. president donald trump has issued a national executive order threatening to revoke federal funding from schools that allow trans student athletes to compete in accordance with their gender. the trump administration is reportedly investigating a district in portland, oregon that has continued to affirm trans students in violation of white house policies, and it’s attempting to threaten maine into following trump’s orders. the usda has already paused federal funding for some of the state’s school programs, claiming that maine is in violation of title ix. state education officials have said they do not intend to capitulate, with the vocal backing of maine’s democratic governor janet mills.

while woodman says that she has faced some negative backlash after her story began gaining outside coverage in publications like hell gate and newsweek, she says the public reaction has, for now, been largely positive. other tennis leagues and even professional athletes have reached out to her to offer their support, including the eastern division of the u.s. tennis association (usta), which affirmed that “tennis is for everyone” in a comment on her instagram page. “so sorry you’re experiencing this, cammie,” the account for the eastern chapter of the united states tennis association, the sport’s national governing body, wrote on march 28.

woodman says that the widespread approbation has only made her more dedicated to a sport that she says has changed her life. tennis is where she finds strength, she says, and it’s also where she feels her most beautiful. when she saw serena williams play in the last games of her storied career, woodman says that she was transfixed by how the superstar athlete was simultaneously graceful and feminine and yet also powerful. picking up a racket for the first time, woodman recalls that it felt the same way that transitioning did: in learning to use her body in new ways that she hadn’t ever even imagined that she could, she was evolving before her own eyes, and it was awe-inspiring to see.

in fighting for space for herself on the court, woodman hopes to keep embodying multitudes. “i’ve always thought to myself: if this ever happened to me, i’ll keep playing and play harder than ever,” she says. “and that’s exactly what i feel like. the day after all of this went down, i went straight back to the court, and i played super well and super hard. that’s what i'm going to keep doing.”","['brooklyn', 'transgender', 'woman', 'mull', 'legal', 'action', 'new', 'york', 'city', 'tennis', 'league', 'bar', 'compete', 'woman', 'follow', 'complaint', 'cisgender', 'woman', 'league',

9c7e9844-9408-49ed-bfc0-ac37a69a7a9c,pro,georgia democrats staged a walkout over republicans’ obsession with anti-trans legislation,"['georgia', 'democrats', 'stage', 'walkout', 'republican', 'obsession', 'anti', 'trans', 'legislation']",them,samantha riedel,https://www.them.us/story/georgia-democrats-walkout-anti-trans-legislation,4/3/2025,"georgia democrats staged a walkout on wednesday protesting multiple republican bills that target transgender rights, including one bill that would ban gender-affirming medical care for incarcerated trans people in the state.

sb 185, which came to a vote before the state house of representatives on wednesday, would block the use of state funds and resources to provide any medical care for the purpose of “altering primary or secondary sexual characteristics.” such treatment, including surgeries and hormone therapy, would only be allowed if it is not for the treatment of gender dysphoria “or the purpose [...] is not for sex reassignment.”

as the georgia recorder reported, almost all 80 democrats in the chamber abruptly walked out rather than cast a vote at all, protesting sb 185 and several other anti-trans gop bills filed this session. those bills include a ban on coverage for gender-affirming care in state employees’ health plans (defying a 2023 settlement that required state plans to cover such care); another bill that would prevent doctors from providing gender-affirming care to trans youth, and which would allow puberty blockers only with the consent of a child’s legal guardian and two doctors; and still another blocking trans women and girls from competing in women’s school sports leagues from elementary school through college. the sports bill passed in both chambers and is currently awaiting republican gov. brian kemp’s signature.

addressing reporters outside the chamber, democrats condemned the gop’s anti-trans agenda and pointed out that even though the legislative session ends on friday, lawmakers have still not passed a state budget for the year — the only law they are required to pass, according to wsb-tv.

“this is day 39, day 39 and we don’t have a budget, and many of our members’ bills have not been heard,” house minority leader carolyn hugley said, per the recorder. “we came here to focus on the opportunity for georgians to live, learn and earn. and what do we get? political theater. what do we get? bills that want to legalize discrimination.”

democratic rep. ruwa romman said sb 185 was “strike three” for her gop colleagues. “we have had no bills on raising the minimum wage. we have had one bill pass about housing. we have had no bills on medicaid expansion,” romman said. “i don’t even know what’s going on with the budget. and you’re telling me that we are going to spend more time on another bill to discriminate?”

house democratic caucus chair tanya miller also decried republicans’ attacks on trans people in a speech on the floor prior to the walkout, as the associated press noted. “what is going on with my colleagues that they have become obsessed with what is happening in transgender citizens’ pants and their underwear and their bedroom and their medical robes, when they talk to their doctors, when they deal with their families?” miller wondered.

republicans hold a majority in the georgia house, with 100 representatives to democrats’ 80, meaning sb 185 would have passed even if all democrats remained in the chamber. the bill passed by a vote of 100-2, with two democrats — reps. regina lewis-ward and david sampson — formally registering their disapproval. three democrats broke with the party to vote with republicans in favor of sb 185: reps. lynn heffner, tangie herring, and dexter sharper. (heffner inaccurately referred to gender-affirming medical care as “elective procedures,” according to the recorder.) having passed in both legislative chambers, the bill has now been sent to kemp for final approval.

incarcerated trans people’s rights to medical care have become another plank in the republican anti-trans agenda over the past year, gaining national attention after president donald trump used the topic for attack ads against then-vice president kamala harris during the 2024 presidential campaign, in which trump accused harris of supporting “transgender operations on illegal aliens.” house majority leader chuck efstration echoed trump’s rhetoric in comments to the ap this week, saying democrats showed “support for taxpayer-funded sex change surgeries for state prisoners,” insinuating that was a position for which they should be ashamed.

u.s. law requires the federal government to “supervise and furnish medical treatment and other necessary medical, psychiatric, and related technical and scientific services [...] in penal and correctional institutions of the united states.” the vast majority of health organizations, including the american medical association say gender-affirming care is medically necessary.

since taking office, trump has sought to end any federal recognition of trans people. his department of justice quickly began transferring trans women into men’s prisons, where they face a severely elevated risk of violence. multiple courts have issued injunctions blocking some of the transfers, but those injunctions apply only to the plaintiffs in those cases, and are not enforced across the board. incarcerated trans women have since reported being transferred out of women’s facilities, saying their records were changed to mark them as men.","['georgia', 'democrats', 'stage', 'walkout',

741d78d2-2dd1-46f0-823b-86f200e1972f,pro,"forced off her track team, a trans high schooler in virginia joined the boys instead","['force', 'track', 'team', 'trans', 'high', 'schooler', 'virginia', 'join', 'boy', 'instead']",them,samantha riedel,https://www.them.us/story/eliza-munshi-trans-track-athlete-virgina-high-school-compete-boys-team,4/4/2025,"a transgender high school girl in virginia has been effectively forced to join a boys’ track and field team after state authorities introduced new restrictions on trans athletes to align with the trump administration earlier this year.

in a profile for the washington post this week, eliza munshi, a senior at falls church high school in virginia, said that she applied to join the girls’ track team in early february. munshi said she was inspired to join following news reports that the virginia high school league (vhsl), the nonprofit organization which governs k-12 school sports in the state, would not change its trans-inclusive policies — most significantly a waiver process by which trans girls could apply to compete on girls’ teams — to adhere to president donald trump’s executive order seeking to ban trans women from women’s sports leagues.

but the vhsl reversed that statement just days later, as virginia public media (vpm) reported. munshi told the post that during her fourth practice with the girls’ team, adults abruptly informed her she would no longer be allowed to compete with them. along with an eight-point test governing trans boys’ eligibility for boys’ sports teams, the vhsl’s updated handbook now specifies that trans girls “may not participate on a girls sports team other than cheerleading,” specifically citing trump’s february executive order. another section of the rulebook, which was already in place, notes that if an athlete who is “officially declared ineligible” competes anyway, the athlete’s “school shall be automatically suspended from the league for a period of one calendar year” unless their participation was required by a court order.

“[w]e really felt like if we’re to be the governing body of the virginia high school league, our policies need to be in compliance with the executive order,” vhsl executive director billy haun told vpm in a statement in february, “so that our member schools and school divisions wouldn't have to choose between the league and the executive order.” (haun is vhsl’s outgoing executive director, and is set to hand over the reins to current assistant director of compliance ty gafford in july.)

not wanting her participation to negatively affect her friends on the girls’ team, munshi told her coach she would compete on the boys’ team instead. she told the post that despite the policy changes, everyone at her school has continued to make her feel welcome. “sometimes i forget i’m transgender. people around me forget too,” she wrote last year in a college admissions essay, per the post.

legally speaking, executive orders do not directly compel compliance outside of the executive branch of the federal government. but since taking office, the trump administration has leaned on many such orders — some of which have already been blocked pending litigation — to demand state and local entities adhere to his sweeping anti-trans agend, or risk losing all federal funding. trump has used his order regarding trans athletes in particular to threaten lawsuits and loss of funding for the university of pennsylvania and multiple educational bodies across maine for alleged noncompliance with his interpretation of title ix civil rights law. the ncaa voluntarily altered its own participation rules to adhere to trump’s order earlier this year. meanwhile, two teens in new hampshire are challenging trump’s sports order in court, along with a state law that bars them from competing in girls’ leagues.

state and local bans on trans girls in k-12 and college sports continue to proliferate across the u.s., as conservatives have latched onto the topic as a useful wedge issue against lgbtq+ rights. such bans are often justified with assertions that trans girls have a “biological advantage” over their cis peers in sports, even if they have received puberty blockers or hormone therapy to suppress testosterone levels. those claims are not supported by current research. in fact, a 2024 study backed by the international olympic committee found that trans women who have suppressed their testosterone may face competitive disadvantages compared to cis women in some key metrics like vertical leap. (the post reported that one of munshi’s best discus throws measure just shy of 47 feet; the current u.s. high school girls’ record for discus throw is 193 feet and eight inches, set by athlete emma sralla in 2023.)

“the way i kind of look at this right now is advanced compliance before all the legal maneuvering is done, and before courts have made their final decisions,” said state sen. danica roem, considered the first trans state lawmaker in u.s. history, in comments to vpm about vhsl’s policy changes in february. “i think it is going to cause actual harm to the people who are most vulnerable right now.”","['transgend', 'high', 'school', 'girl', 'virginia', 'effectively', 'force', 'join', 'boy', 'track', 'field', 'team', 'state', 'authority', 'introduce', 'new', 'restriction', 'trans', 'athlete', 'align', 'trump', 'administration', 'early', 'year', 'profile', 'washington', 'post', 'week', 'eliza', 'munshi', 'senior', 'falls', 'church', 'high', 'school', 'virginia', 'say', 'apply', 'join', 'girl', 'track', 'team', 'early', 'february', 'munshi', 'say', 'inspire', 'join', 'follow', 'news', 'report', 'virginia', 'high', 'school', 'league', 'vhsl', 'nonprofit', 'organization', 'govern', 'school', 'sport', 'state', 'change', 'trans', 'inclusive', 'policy', 'significantly', 'waiver', 'process', 'tran', 'girl', 'apply', 'compete', 'girl', 'team', 'adhere', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'executive', 'order', 'seek', 'ban', 'trans', 'woman', 'woman', 'sport', 'league', 'vhsl', 'reverse', 'statement', 'day', 'later', 'virginia', 'public', 'media', 'vpm', 'report', 'munshi', 'tell', 'post', 'fourth', 'practice', 'girl', 'team', 'adult', 'abruptly', 'inform', 'long', 'allow', 'compete', 'point', 'test', 'govern', 'trans', 'boy', 'eligibility', 'boy', 'sport', 'team', 'vhsl', 'update', 'handbook', 'specify', 'trans', 'girl', 'participate', 'girl', 'sport', 'team', 'cheerlead', 'specifically', 'cite', 'trump', 'february', 'executive', 'order', 'section', 'rulebook', 'place', 'note', 'athlete', 'officially', 'declare', 'ineligible', 'compete', 'athlete', 'school', 'shall', 'automatically', 'suspend', 'league', 'period', 'calendar', 'year', 'participation', 'require', 'court', 'order', 'feel', 'like', 'govern', 'body', 'virginia', 'high', 'school', 'league', 'policy', 'need', 'compliance', 'executive', 'order', 'vhsl', 'executive', 'director', 'billy', 'haun', 'tell', 'vpm', 'statement', 'february', 'member', 'school', 'school', 'division', 'choose', 'league', 'executive', 'order', 'haun', 'vhsl', 'outgoing', 'executive', 'director', 'set', 'hand', 'rein', 'current', 'assistant', 'director', 'compliance', 'ty', 'gafford', 'july', 'want', 'participation', 'negatively', 'affect', 'friend', 'girl', 'team', 'munshi', 'tell', 'coach', 'compete', 'boy', 'team', 'instead', 'tell', 'post', 'despite', 'policy', 'change', 'school', 'continue', 'feel', 'welcome', 'forget', 'transgender', 'people', 'forget', 'write', 'year', 'college', 'admission', 'essay', 'post', 'legally', 'speak', 'executive', 'order', 'directly', 'compel', 'compliance', 'outside', 'executive', 'branch', 'federal', 'government', 'take', 'office', 'trump', 'administration', 'lean', 'order', 'block', 'pende', 'litigation', 'demand', 'state', 'local', 'entity', 'adhere', 'sweeping', 'anti', 'trans', 'agend', 'risk', 'lose', 'federal', 'funding', 'trump', 'order', 'trans', 'athlete', 'particular', 'threaten', 'lawsuit', 'loss', 'funding', 'university', 'pennsylvania', 'multiple', 'educational', 'body', 'maine', 'alleged', 'noncompliance', 'interpretation', 'title', 'ix', 'civil', 'right', 'law', 'ncaa', 'voluntarily', 'alter', 'participation', 'rule', 'adhere', 'trump', 'order', 'early', 'year', 'teen', 'new', 'hampshire', 'challenge', 'trump', 'sport', 'order', 'court', 'state', 'law', 'bar', 'compete', 'girl', 'league', 'state', 'local', 'ban', 'trans', 'girl', 'college', 'sport', 'continue', 'proliferate', 'conservative', 'latch', 'topic', 'useful', 'wedge', 'issue', 'right', 'ban', 'justify', 'assertion', 'trans', 'girl', 'biological', 'advantage', 'cis', 'peer', 'sport', 'receive', 'puberty', 'blocker', 'hormone', 'therapy', 'suppress', 'testosterone', 'level', 'claim', 'support', 'current', 'research', 'fact', 'study', 'back', 'international', 'olympic', 'committee', 'find', 'trans', 'woman', 'suppress', 'testosterone', 'face', 'competitive', 'disadvantage', 'compare', 'cis', 'woman', 'key', 'metric', 'like', 'vertical', 'leap', 'post', 'report', 'munshi', 'good', 'discus', 'throw', 'measure', 'shy', 'foot', 'current', 'high', 'school', 'girl', 'record', 'discus', 'throw', 'foot', 'inch', 'set', 'athlete', 'emma', 'sralla', 'way', 'kind', 'look', 'right', 'advanced', 'compliance', 'legal', 'maneuvering', 'court', 'final', 'decision', 'say', 'state', 'sen', 'danica', 'roem', 'consider', 'trans', 'state', 'lawmaker', 'history', 'comment', 'vpm', 'vhsl', 'policy', 'change', 'february', 'think', 'go', 'cause', 'actual', 'harm', 'people', 'vulnerable', 'right']",
9d94ee03-085a-4c0d-81e6-b8176cb6b6d0,pro,trump administration announces special investigative team to root out trans athletes,"['trump', 'administration', 'announce', 'special', 'investigative', 'team', 'root', 'tran', 'athlete']",them,abby monteil,https://www.them.us/story/title-ix-special-investigations-team-trump-administration-linda-mcmahon-trans-athletes,4/8/2025,"the trump administration is assembling a new “title ix special investigations team” (sit) aiming to bar transgender women and girls from women’s bathrooms and sports teams.

the departments of education and justice announced the team in a joint april 4 press release, claiming that it was formed “to ensure timely, consistent resolutions to protect students… from the pernicious effects of gender ideology in school programs and activities.”

the release claimed that both departments have faced “a staggering volume of title ix complaints,” although no further details were provided. the title ix sit team will be made up of investigators from both the education and justice departments.

secretary of education linda mcmahon misgendered trans women and girls in a statement of her own, adding, “to all the entities that continue to allow men to compete in women’s sports and use women’s intimate facilities: there’s a new sheriff in town. we will not allow you to get away with denying women’s civil rights any longer.”

title ix, which was passed as part of the education amendments of 1972, is a federal law that bars sex-based discrimination in federally funded educational opportunities. however, the second trump administration has attempted to weaponize the law against trans students. back in february, the president signed the executive order titled “keeping men out of women’s sports,” which states that the administration will deem trans women competing in women’s sports as a violaation of title ix and threatens to withhold funding from educational programs that the administration claims “deprive women and girls of fair athletic opportunities” by including trans athletes.

in a statement to nbc news, a spokesperson for glaad described the creation of the title ix sit team as a “baseless plan with the potential to waste untold taxpayer resources to pursue an unhinged agenda of animus.”

“targeting a handful of athletes does nothing to protect women and the girls,” the glaad spokesperson continued. “in fact, these bans endanger all girls as they risk invasive genital exams and other expensive ‘verification.’”

the trump administration has already clashed with multiple educational bodies over trump’s political fixation on trans girls playing school sports. in february, the department of education announced that it was launching an investigation into the maine department of education and a public school district attended by a trans athlete, claiming that the state’s department of education violated federal anti-discrimination law. in a march 10 press release, the university of maine shared that the u.s. department of agriculture had suspended all research and program funding to the university amid the president’s ongoing feud with the state’s educational bodies. meanwhile, in march, the administration paused $175 million in funding to the university of pennsylvania over a single trans athlete who has not been a student at the school since 2022.","['trump', 'administration', 'assemble', 'new', 'title', 'ix', 'special', 'investigation', 'team', 'sit', 'aim', 'bar', 'transgender', 'woman', 'girl', 'woman', 'bathroom', 'sport', 'team', 'department', 'education', 'justice', 'announce', 'team', 'joint', 'april', 'press', 'release', 'claim', 'form', 'ensure', 'timely', 'consistent', 'resolution', 'protect', 'student', 'pernicious', 'effect', 'gender', 'ideology', 'school', 'program', 'activity', 'release', 'claim', 'department', 'face', 'staggering', 'volume', 'title', 'ix', 'complaint', 'detail', 'provide', 'title', 'ix', 'sit', 'team', 'investigator', 'education', 'justice', 'department', 'secretary', 'education', 'linda', 'mcmahon', 'misgendere', 'trans', 'woman', 'girl', 'statement', 'add', 'entity', 'continue', 'allow', 'man', 'compete', 'woman', 'sport', 'use', 'woman', 'intimate', 'facility', 'new', 'sheriff', 'town', 'allow', 'away', 'deny', 'woman', 'civil', 'right', 'long', 'title', 'ix', 'pass', 'education', 'amendment', 'federal', 'law', 'bar', 'sex', 'base', 'discrimination', 'federally', 'fund', 'educational', 'opportunity', 'second', 'trump', 'administration', 'attempt', 'weaponize', 'law', 'trans', 'student', 'february', 'president', 'sign', 'executive', 'order', 'title', 'keep', 'man', 'woman', 'sport', 'state', 'administration', 'deem', 'trans', 'woman', 'compete', 'woman', 'sport', 'violaation', 'title', 'ix', 'threaten', 'withhold', 'funding', 'educational', 'program', 'administration', 'claim', 'deprive', 'woman', 'girl', 'fair', 'athletic', 'opportunity', 'include', 'trans', 'athlete', 'statement', 'nbc', 'news', 'spokesperson', 'glaad', 'describe', 'creation', 'title', 'ix', 'sit', 'team', 'baseless', 'plan', 'potential', 'waste', 'untold', 'taxpayer', 'resource', 'pursue', 'unhinged', 'agenda', 'animus', 'target', 'handful', 'athlete', 'protect', 'woman', 'girl', 'glaad', 'spokesperson', 'continue', 'fact', 'ban', 'endanger', 'girl', 'risk', 'invasive', 'genital', 'exam', 'expensive', 'verification', 'trump', 'administration', 'clash', 'multiple', 'educational', 'body', 'trump', 'political', 'fixation', 'trans', 'girl', 'play', 'school', 'sport', 'february', 'department', 'education', 'announce', 'launch', 'investigation', 'maine', 'department', 'education', 'public', 'school', 'district', 'attend', 'trans', 'athlete', 'claim', 'state', 'department', 'education', 'violate', 'federal', 'anti', 'discrimination', 'law', 'march', 'press', 'release', 'university', 'maine', 'share', 'department', 'agriculture', 'suspend', 'research', 'program', 'funding', 'university', 'amid', 'president', 'ongoing', 'feud', 'state', 'educational', 'body', 'march', 'administration', 'pause', 'million', 'funding', 'university', 'pennsylvania', 'single', 'trans', 'athlete', 'student', 'school']",
fd60b8b9-a0b1-434c-918c-617b1970f669,pro,montana republicans say no to prosecuting parents for trans care,"['montana', 'republicans', 'prosecute', 'parent', 'trans', 'care']",them,"henry carnell, sara szilagy",https://www.them.us/story/montana-republicans-say-no-to-prosecuting-parents-for-trans-care,4/10/2025,"five days after president donald trump declared “gender ideology” to be “one of the most prevalent forms of child abuse,” montana’s republican-controlled house of representatives killed a bill that would have enshrined much the same idea into state law by criminalizing parents and medical providers.

montana senate bill 164 would have made it a felony for any adult to help transgender children under 16 to gain access to gender-affirming medical care—including hormones, puberty blockers, and surgeries—classifying such help as child endangerment. on tuesday, house lawmakers voted 58-40 to reject the proposed law, with 17 republicans joining democrats to block the bill from advancing to its final reading.

“i think it’s overly broad,” the lone republican to speak against the bill, rep. brad barker, said tuesday. barker said that while he generally opposes gender-affirming care for trans youth, sb164 was “the wrong approach.”

“i don’t like the thought of criminalizing parents,” barker said, entreating fellow republicans to “vote with your conscience.”

the bill carried penalties of up to five years in prison and $10,000 in fines for any adults, including parents and doctors, who provided children with surgery, puberty blockers, or hormone replacement therapy for the purpose of “altering the appearance” of the child or affirming the child’s gender. if “serious bodily injury” occurred, the maximum punishment was 10 years imprisonment and $25,000 in fines.

“turning parents and doctors into felons is absolutely not the approach that best serves this state,” democratic rep. sj howell, the first non-binary person to be elected to the montana legislature, said on the house floor.

the bill cleared the senate in february, 30-20, with two republicans voting against it. in that floor debate, the legislation’s sponsor, republican sen. john fuller, called it a “simple bill” to protect montana’s children. “the state does have a compelling interest, a very compelling interest, to avoid the sterilization and sexual mutilation of children,” he said. in 2023, fuller sponsored a law that threatened medical providers’ licensing if they offered gender-affirming care to minors, a law that courts have blocked while litigation proceeds.

tuesday’s vote was the second time this year a large swath of republicans crossed party lines to block an anti-trans bill.

“this bill is not about politics, it’s about safeguarding the health and innocence of montana youth,” one of sb164’s house supporters, republican rep. braxton mitchell, said tuesday. but more than a quarter of members of his own party disagreed, suggesting a potential turning point for the montana legislature, at least on trans issues.

tuesday’s vote was the second time this year a large swath of republicans crossed party lines to block an anti-trans bill. last year, montana’s first openly transgender lawmaker, rep. zooey zephyr, said her republican colleagues often privately bemoan the transphobic culture wars and apologize to her for their votes on anti-lgbtq legislation.

even so, republican gov. greg gianforte signed two anti-trans bills into law last month—a bathroom ban and a law prohibiting trans girls and women from playing on women’s sports teams from kindergarten through college. the bathroom ban has been temporarily blocked. a state law that prohibited trans women from participating in female collegiate sports was ruled unconstitutional in 2022.

orlando pride supporters stand in front of a banner about protecting trans kids during a game between orlando pride and chicago stars at inter&co stadium on march 14, 2025 in orlando, florida. 
the right to privacy is enshrined in the montana constitution, and state courts have strongly affirmed its application to healthcare laws. last december, the montana supreme court upheld a lower court’s preliminary injunction on a law that would have made gender-affirming medical care providers vulnerable to licensing board disciplinary proceedings. and last summer, it ruled that a parental consent law for minors seeking abortion was unconstitutional. (in january, montana attorney general austin knudsen asked the u.s. supreme court to declare that ruling an unconstitutional infringement on parental rights. the supreme court has not decided whether to hear the case.)

if it had passed, sb164 would have become the first law in the country defining gender-affirming care as a form of felony child endangerment. (child endangerment and abuse fall under different statutes, but both evoke the same myth that gender-affirming care is dangerous for youth.)

montana, however, wouldn’t have been the first state to direct child welfare workers to investigate families of trans children. in 2022, texas republican gov. greg abbott ordered the state’s department of family and protective services to open child abuse investigations into parents who seek gender-affirming care for their children. that directive remains partially blocked after families of trans children and the lgbtq advocacy group pflag sued.","['day', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'declare', 'gender', 'ideology', 'prevalent', 'form', 'child', 'abuse', 'montana', 'republican',

78cfcc8d-f00b-4408-952e-26c6416c7a44,pro,"nicola coughlan raised over £70,000 for trans rights following u.k. court ruling","['nicola', 'coughlan', 'raise', 'tran', 'right', 'follow', 'court', 'ruling']",them,abby monteil,https://www.them.us/story/nicola-coughlan-bridgerton-star-trans-rights-uk-court-ruling,4/18/2025,"bridgerton star nicola coughlan has raised over £70,000 (roughly $96,000) for the trans charity not a phase following the u.k. supreme court’s wednesday ruling that the legal definitions of “man” and “woman” are based on a person’s “biological sex.”.

the ruling’s long-ranging effects are still up in the air, but it is poised to have chilling, far-ranging effects on trans rights in the u.k. as legal researcher jess o’thompson explained on lgbtq+ news site queer af, trans people in the u.k. can now be excluded from all “single-sex” spaces under any circumstances and cannot make equal pay claims.

british anti-trans advocates have been publicly celebrating the news, including harry potter author j.k. rowling, who posted a photo of herself enjoying a cigar and drink on x with the caption “i love it when a plan comes together” after reportedly donating over £70,000 to for women scotland, the anti-trans organization that had brought the supreme court case forward. yet other u.k. celebrities, like coughlan, have wasted no time publicly reaffirming their support for the trans community in the ruling’s aftermath.

on april 17, coughlan took to instagram to announce that she was launching a fundraiser for not a phase, a trans charity that aims to improve the lives of trans adults across the u.k. “through awareness campaigning, social projects, and funding trans+ lead initiatives,” per the organization’s official website. the actress originally set a fundraising goal of £10,000 and pledged to match donations up to that amount.

“to see an already-marginalized community… be further attacked in law is really stomach turning and disgusting, and these people celebrating it [are] more stomach turning and disgusting,” coughlan said in a video. “if you are a cisgender person who is an ally of a trans person, i think now is the time to just… speak up and make your voice heard, and let your trans, nonbinary friends and just the community at large know that you’re there for them and will keep fighting for them.”


just an hour after launching the fundraiser, coughlan shared on her instagram story that fans had already met her £10,000 target. in just over 24 hours, the fundraiser has raised well over £70,000 at the time of writing. she has since set a new fundraising goal of £79,699.21 (roughly $105,725).

coughlan isn’t the only cis u.k. celebrity who’s spoken out on behalf of trans rights following the supreme court’s ruling. on april 17, the white lotus star aimee lou wood re-shared a post from lgbtq+ activist ellen jones to her instagram story denouncing the ruling.

“pure rage,” wood captioned her story. “this country is a hell hole.”

coughlan’s bridgerton co-star, charitha chandran, also called out the ruling in an april 17 tiktok that has received over 2.3 million likes.

“how pathetic to target one of the most oppressed groups in our society,” chandran said. “honestly? loser behavior… you don’t care about women. you just want to target those who are already oppressed.”","['bridgerton', 'star', 'nicola', 'coughlan', 'raise', 'roughly', 'trans', 'charity', 'phase', 'follow', 'supreme', 'court', 'wednesday', 'rule', 'legal', 'definition', 'man', 'woman', 'base', 'person', 'biological', 'sex', 'ruling', 'long', 'range', 'effect', 'air', 'poise', 'chill', 'far', 'range', 'effect', 'tran', 'right', 'legal', 'researcher', 'jess', 'explain', 'news', 'site', 'queer', 'af', 'trans', 'people', 'exclude', 'single', 'sex', 'space', 'circumstance', 'equal', 'pay', 'claim', 'british', 'anti', 'trans', 'advocate', 'publicly', 'celebrate', 'news', 'include', 'harry', 'potter', 'author', 'rowling', 'post', 'photo', 'enjoy', 'cigar', 'drink', 'x', 'caption', 'love', 'plan', 'come', 'reportedly', 'donate', 'woman', 'scotland', 'anti', 'trans', 'organization', 'bring', 'supreme', 'court', 'case', 'forward', 'celebrity', 'like', 'coughlan', 'waste', 'time', 'publicly', 'reaffirm', 'support', 'trans', 'community', 'ruling', 'aftermath', 'april', 'coughlan', 'take', 'instagram', 'announce', 'launch', 'fundraiser', 'phase', 'trans', 'charity', 'aim', 'improve', 'life', 'trans', 'adult', 'awareness', 'campaigning', 'social', 'project', 'fund', 'lead', 'initiative', 'organization', 'official', 'website', 'actress', 'originally', 'set', 'fundraising', 'goal', 'pledge', 'match', 'donation', 'marginalize', 'community', 'attack', 'law', 'stomach', 'turning', 'disgusting', 'people', 'celebrate', 'stomach', 'turn', 'disgusting', 'coughlan', 'say', 'video', 'cisgender', 'person', 'ally', 'trans', 'person', 'think', 'time', 'speak', 'voice', 'hear', 'let', 'trans', 'nonbinary', 'friend', 'community', 'large', 'know', 'fight', 'hour', 'launch', 'fundraiser', 'coughlan', 'share', 'instagram', 'story', 'fan', 'meet', 'target', 'hour', 'fundraiser', 'raise', 'time', 'writing', 'set', 'new', 'fundraising', 'goal', 'roughly', 'coughlan', 'cis', 'celebrity', 'speak', 'behalf', 'trans', 'right', 'follow', 'supreme', 'court', 'ruling', 'april', 'white', 'lotus', 'star', 'aimee', 'lou', 'wood', 'share', 'post', 'activist', 'ellen', 'jones', 'instagram', 'story', 'denounce', 'ruling', 'pure', 'rage', 'wood', 'caption', 'story', 'country', 'hell', 'hole', 'coughlan', 'bridgerton', 'co', 'star', 'charitha', 'chandran', 'call', 'ruling', 'april', 'tiktok', 'receive', 'million', 'like', 'pathetic', 'target', 'oppress', 'group', 'society', 'chandran', 'say', 'honestly', 'loser', 'behavior', 'care', 'woman', 'want', 'target', 'oppress']",
2b5117b3-3b85-4483-8731-a21e75eb26ae,pro,drag race winner venus says she was violently attacked in mexico: “i’m lucky to be alive”,"['drag', 'race', 'winner', 'venus', 'say', 'violently', 'attack', 'mexico', 'lucky', 'alive']",them,mathew rodriguez,https://www.them.us/story/venus-canada-drag-race-police-attack-mexico,4/22/2025,"in an instagram story posted on sunday, canada’s drag race season four winner venus alleged that she was abducted, assaulted, and robbed while visiting puerto vallarta, mexico. although she initially alleged that her assailants were the police, she posted to her story again on tuesday, clarifying that the incident “occurred prior to any police involvement and is not the result of a wrongful abduction or brutality by the authorities.”

the drag artist also said that she should have waited until she had clarity on what happened before making a public statement and that she takes “full accountability that my previous statement does not align with the events of that night.”

“i want to take a moment and express a deep gratitude and appreciation for the efforts of those who helped me piece things together with compassion,” she continued.

in her earlier posts, venus said she had been abducted, ""handcuffed and tossed around in the back of a truck hatchback.” she further said, “i was choked and kicked for an hour and then they took $1,000 cash from me and my headphones, and then i had to [pay them] hundreds more dollars to get released.”

alongside the caption, venus had also posted images of what appear to be bruises on her elbow, stomach, and neck. she also asked if anyone had any legal advice on what she should do about the alleged attack.

“front desk won’t help me because they think i’m guilty of not paying for my taxi which makes no sense because that’s why i took out cash in the first place,” she said in the first post. “corruption on every level.” (venus did not specify which front desk she was talking about.)

in a second post, venus shared a photo of a building in the area, which she said is where her attackers “left me here bleeding on the side of a dark road in the middle of the night after being held handcuffed for hours while they all laughed at me.” she added, “i’m still in shock and i’m not sure what to do. i’m bruised and very sore — i honestly can’t even comprehend the last 5 hours i’m just lucky to be alive.”

venus went on to thank the queer community in puerto vallarta, a popular destination for lgbtq+ travelers, for their help. “we are still gathering all the details from last night, and we are working with the respective authorities to come to some sort of [resolution],” she wrote in a follow-up story, per entertainment weekly. “please do not worry about me. i am safe and i am with loved ones. thank you again for all your messages and support.”

two lgbtq+ advocacy groups in puerto vallarta have issued statements in the wake of the alleged attack. the vallarta diversity network called for an “immediate, impartial, and transparent investigation into the events,” as reported by mexican lgbtq+ outlet out & about puerto vallarta. the group also expressed “profound condemnation and dismay,” while pointing out that venus’s alleged attack is part of a string of assaults targeting trans people, sex workers, and lgbtq+ tourists.

additionally, the vallarta gay+ community council said that it has scheduled a meeting with nightlife venue owners to ensure better safety going forward, and that they are meeting with local authorities “to explore further actions and reinforce our collaboration,” according to out & about.

in march, members of puerto vallarta’s lgbtq+ community met with city officials and police to address ongoing “concerns regarding interactions between local law enforcement and the lgbtq+ community,” per out & about. however, chief eduardo horacia llanas cuevas “only acknowledged the concerns and emphasized the importance of filing formal complaints to initiate investigations.”

last year, venus became the first indigenous queen to take home the top prize on canada’s drag race when she won the season four crown. the cast of that season also included eventual traitors canada star melissa verga.

“to my mother, father, sister, family, friends, my hometown, my ancestors and these very unceded lands that i stand on and to [the] creator who has and will always protect me — this is for us,” venus wrote on instagram at the time. “i could not have done this without each and every one of you. thank you for always believing in me and lifting me up — i take none of this for granted.”

news of venus’s alleged attack comes only a few days after season 14 rupaul’s drag race contestant jasmine kennedie said on instagram that she was followed and harassed by a stranger on the new york city subway for being a trans woman.

“remember to stay safe y’all and never let fear stop you from living your life authentically,” she wrote in a post following her harrowing experience.

venus ended her most recent post by thanking everyone who helped her piece together what happened the night she was attacked. ""i want to take a moment and express a deep gratitude and appreciation for the efforts of those who helped me piece things together with compassion

c92b0ce3-3e8b-4ce7-99d0-a673422ce9fc,pro,"who is luis antonio tagle, the gay internet’s favorite papal candidate?","['luis', 'antonio', 'tagle', 'gay', 'internet', 'favorite', 'papal', 'candidate']",them,samantha riedel,https://www.them.us/story/cardinal-luis-antonio-tagle-pope-front-runner-catholic-church-francis-conclave,4/22/2025,"following pope francis’ death this week at age 88, catholics around the world (and lgbtq+ people affected by the church’s doctrine) are wondering who will take his place. among the reported frontrunners is cardinal luis antonio tagle, a close ally and advisor to francis who could become the first filipino pope in history — and potentially continue in the spirit of francis’ fraught relationship with lgbtq+ rights. indeed, in the somewhat ironic conclave-inspired social media discourse around the selection of the next pope, tagle has emerged as a queer favorite.

born in the philippines in 1957, tagle first entered the priesthood in 1982 and became a bishop in 2001. he went on to serve as the archbishop of manila from 2011 to 2020, and was elevated to cardinal by pope benedict xvi in 2012 — the seventh filipino to be named a cardinal in church history, as rolling stone philippines reported this week. tagle later became prefect of the congregation for the evangelization of peoples in february 2020, and francis elevated tagle to cardinal-bishop of san felice da cantalice a centocelle in rome that may, making him the first filipino clergymember to be granted the church’s highest (sub-papal) rank. from 2015 to 2022, tagle was also the president of caritas internationalis, the umbrella network of international catholic aid and development organizations.

tagle was frequently compared to francis after the latter became pope in 2013. like francis, tagle’s humbler tendencies, like riding public transportation, set him apart from other catholic leaders. some in the philippines described tagle as “unassuming” and “approachable” in remarks to the bbc in 2013, when tagle was already considered a contender for the papacy.

tagle also shared with francis a somewhat sympathetic view of lgbtq+ people, whom he acknowledged had been mistreated by the church. “[t]he harsh words that were used in the past to refer to gays and divorced and separated people, the unwed mothers, et cetera, in the past they were quite severe,” tagle told a catholic youth conference in london in 2015. “many people who belonged to those groups were branded and that led to their isolation from the wider society.” in 2017, tagle reportedly led a catholic social media initiative for easter in the philippines called the “lazarus project,” using the hashtag “#resurrectlove” to call for lgbtq+ acceptance in churches. and in 2019, tagle called on catholic youth to stop discriminating against or “labeling” lgbtq+ people, asking them instead to use “your vocation, your talents, and your uniqueness [...] for the greater glory of god, not against other people or society.”

but also like francis, tagle largely adheres to church doctrine on topics like homosexuality and same-sex marriage. in 2015 he said that “the sacrament of reconciliation” — the formal term for catholic confession — allows for “individual persons and individual cases [to be] taken uniquely or individually” and be embraced by the church; in other words, catholics should be more welcoming and compassionate to lgbtq+ people, but not because being gay isn’t a sin. tagle likewise backed up francis’ remarks in the pope’s january 2015 visit to manila, where francis warned against “ideological colonization” by secular support for same-sex marriage, abortion, and contraception, which he said would “destroy” catholic families.

“paul vi was courageous [...] he warned his sheep about the wolves that were approaching,” francis said in part, referencing pope paul vi’s ban on contraception. tagle later called francis’ remarks “a stroke of genius,” adding that francis “affirmed the teaching of paul vi regarding the openness of the family to life […] but then he reminded all us, too, that pope paul vi was very sensitive to particular cases.” in remarks to reporters, tagle added that african bishops had told him foreign aid to their countries was sometimes conditional on accepting “alien” views, i.e. support for same-sex marriage and lgbtq+ identities, according to the catholic news service.

as archbishop of manila, tagle was a major voice in the church’s opposition to the philippines’ responsible parenthood act of 2012, which made sex education in schools compulsory and promised free access to contraception. tagle told the bbc in 2015 that “[t]he question is how do we teach people how to be responsible parents” rather than allowing easier access to contraception — though again, tagle encouraged compassion for individual people, saying that “we have to be sensitive, pastorally, to the difficulties that persons and families face.”

the pontiff established himself as one of the most progressive in the church's history.
but tagle also holds hardline views on abortion, which is heavily criminalized across the philippines. in 2016, tagle equated abortion to the ascendant duterte regime’s killings of thousands of people, alleged to be connected to the drug trade. “many are worried [about] extrajudicial killings, and we should be [...] but i hope we're also worried about abortion,” tagle said during remarks to the catholic radio station radio veritas in august 2016. “why are only [a] few people speaking out against abortion? that's also murder!”

tagle may not ascend to the papacy himself, of course; there are several other cardinals who might be selected for the job, such as polish cardinal konrad krajewski, francis’ head of the dicastery for the service of charity and the man who delivered aid to struggling trans sex workers during the earliest months of the covid-19 pandemic. whoever the college of cardinals selects when the white smoke flies, even the best-case scenario for the next pope will — as the old joke goes — still be catholic.","['follow', 'pope', 'francis', 'death', 'week', 'age', 'catholic', 'world', 'people', 'affect',

93da9e0d-89f1-4c25-858b-bf8b4c41ce79,pro,what is pope francis’ legacy on queer and trans rights?,"['pope', 'francis', 'legacy', 'queer', 'tran', 'right']",them,samantha riedel,https://www.them.us/story/so-what-does-pope-francis-actually-think-about-queer-and-trans-people,4/21/2025,"after becoming the 266th leader of the catholic church in 2013, the late pope francis — née cardinal jorge mario bergoglio — established himself as one of the most boundary-pushing popes in modern history. that led a group of five cardinals to issue a list of concerns, or dubia, in october 2023 challenging some of his most radical positions on lgbtq+ rights and other issues.

still, in the catholic church, “radical” is subjective. francis certainly took many positions that softened catholic doctrine regarding lgbtq+ people and issues. that isn’t a hard thing to do, given that his predecessor pope benedict believed gay marriage would bring about the apocalypse and some leading bishops even lobbied against an lgbtq+ suicide hotline. but francis also contradicted himself and split some very specific hairs regarding lgbtq+ rights. and on a few issues, like the concept of transgender people, his principles were heavily orthodox.

with so many different statements released during his papacy, it can be hard to figure out what pope francis actually believed, especially about queer and trans people and how we live our lives. below, we’ve rounded up the highlights from francis’ papacy to make sense of how catholicism might have slowly changed under his leadership — and in what ways it’s still the same old $30 billion tax haven we’re used to.

what was pope francis’s stance on gay people?
francis generally took the open-ended position that god loves gays and wants them welcomed in the church. in 2013, the pope famously said that “if someone is gay and is searching for the lord [...] who am i to judge?” the statement was widely lauded at the time simply for being the first time a pope had ever said the word “gay,” rather than “homosexual,” in public remarks. (since then, francis frequently spoke of “homosexuals” in various comments.)

in 2015, francis affirmed the ministry of bishop jacques gaillot, who was removed from his ministry in 1995 after he blessed gay couples. in 2018 francis said that gay catholics are made and loved by god, and in a surprise meeting at the vatican in 2020, told families of lgbtq+ youth that “god loves your children as they are.” conversely, francis excommunicated anti-lgbtq+ archbishop carlo maria viganò in 2024, although he did so because of inflammatory statements viganò made about the pope himself rather than his views on lgbtq+ people.

but while he regularly affirmed queer love in the abstract, the pope was less positive about what all those homosexuals might end up doing with one another. while “being homosexual is not a “crime,” as francis exhorted in january 2023, he went on to say that “it’s a sin [...] first let’s distinguish between a sin and a crime.” this seemed to contradict another statement francis made in 2019, when he said the “tendencies” to be gay “are not a sin.”

in particular, francis said that queer relations between clergy members were a “serious concern” and “worry” him. “the question of homosexuality is a very serious one,” francis said in a 2018 book interview, and there was “no room” for anyone in the ministry to enter a queer relationship (though heterosexual ones were still okay). “in our societies, it even seems homosexuality is fashionable. and this mentality, in some way, also influences the life of the church,” he fretted, recommending “persons with this rooted tendency not be accepted into ministry or consecrated life.”

in 2024, francis used a homophobic slur while reiterating those fears in two separate closed-door meetings with bishops. francis said at the time that young gay men should be accepted into the church itself, but were “better off not being welcomed” into seminaries, in which he said there was already “too many frociaggine” — an italian slur approximately translating to “faggotness” or “faggotry.” vatican spokesperson matteo bruni later told reporters that the pope “never intended to offend or express himself in homophobic terms, and he extends his apologies to those who were offended by the use of a term that was reported to others.”

did pope francis support same-sex marriage?
well, yes, but actually no.

in december 2023, the vatican issued a declaration that stated that same-sex couples could receive blessings from catholic priests. however, the governing body of the catholic church also maintained that these blessings are not equivalent to a liturgical rite, and should not be confused with marriage.

francis was a vocal supporter of legal “civil unions,” but that’s as far from church orthodoxy as he was willing to stray. that position dated back to his pre-papal days as cardinal bergoglio, when he was a leading proponent for a 2010 same-sex “civil union” bill in argentina. as soon as that bill fell through, however, bergoglio wrote a letter to the carmelite nuns of buenos aires to sound the alarm about another bill legalizing same-sex “marriage,” which was ultimately successful. the law represented “the outright rejection of the law of god,” the pope-to-be wrote at the time, by “a ‘movement’ of the father of lies,” — i.e., satan — “that seeks to confuse and deceive the children of god.”

after kim davis infamously refused to grant same-sex marriage licenses to gay couples as a kentucky county clerk in 2015, claiming she acted “under god’s authority,” pope francis met with davis that september during his visit to washington, d.c. a vatican statement asserted francis only interacted with davis as part of an audience with “several dozen persons,” and that their meeting “should not be considered a form of support of her position.” davis and her lawyers at the conservative liberty counsel have told a different story, saying francis said he would pray for davis, “thanked her for her courage and told her to ‘stay strong.’”

the pope continued to ride this line for years, calling same-sex marriage “a contradiction” in some 2019 comments that lgbtq+ figures roundly condemned. francis doubled down in 2021, saying that since “marriage” is a god-delivered sacrament, the church did not have the power to alter its definition. civil unions can “help the situation” in a legal sense, he explained, but “marriage is marriage.”

in the final years of his life, pope francis still held that “civil unions” were the only way to reconcile the religious and legal definitions of marriage. in his response to five conservative cardinals’ complaints in 2023, francis expressed support for clergy (like gaillot) who bless same-sex unions, but only if those blessings “do not convey a mistaken concept of marriage.” that privilege, he said, was still reserved for “a man and a woman” — specifically, the ones who are “naturally open to procreation.” super.

what did pope francis think about transgender people?
what the pope said about trans people didn’t always match up with how he treated them. francis was most infamously known among trans communities for comparing trans people to nuclear weaponry, comments that gave us the best flagging shirts of all time. “[g]ender theory [...] does not recognize the order of creation,” francis said in a 2014 interview, and thus “man commits a new sin, that against god the creator” whose design “is written in nature.” francis reiterated that concept in 2016, writing that trans youth “need to be helped to accept their own body as it was created” rather than physically transition.

in 2019, the vatican distributed a memo entitled “male and female he created them,” a document which declared both trans and intersex identities “only a ‘provocative’ display against so-called ‘traditional frameworks’” that “seek to annihilate the concept of ‘nature.’” if you’re nonbinary, no, you’re not: that idea is “nothing more than a confused concept of freedom in the realm of feelings and wants,” wrote cardinal giuseppe versaldi in the memo, published by the vatican press. in early 2023, francis went even further: “gender ideology, today, is one of the most dangerous ideological colonizations” in the world, he said, because “it blurs differences and the value of men and women.” later in the year, he did make an allowance that trans people could receive baptism, but only if doing so would not cause a “scandal.”

but despite apparently seeing them as unnatural threats to divine creation, francis at least provided some amount of material support to trans people in need, particularly following the start of the covid-19 pandemic. in 2020, francis donated an undisclosed amount of money to a group of unhoused trans sex workers sheltering in an italian church. since then, he has gone on to meet with the same group at least five separate times, eating pasta with them and over 1,000 others at a lunch in november, recognizing the church’s world day of the poor. for those trans people, pope francis was a major force for good — at least, more so than he was viewed elsewhere in the world. “we transgenders in italy feel a bit more human because the fact that pope francis brings us closer to the church is a beautiful thing,” carla segovia told reuters after the lunch. “because we need some love.”

the disconnect between francis’ views on transitioning and acceptance of the people who do it was on full display in 2024. on march 25 that year, the vatican released a 20-page declaration called “infinite dignity,” in which francis denounced both surrogate pregnancy and gender-affirming medical care by claiming both procedures are attempts to “make oneself god.” months later, in october, francis held a private audience with several transgender and intersex catholics who argued that gender-affirming care itself is a gift from god. francis reportedly listened “with empathy,” according to those in attendance, and allegedly said he would “consider their openness to transgender people as a criteria” when appointing new bishops.

several months later, in february 2025, doctrine chief cardinal victor manuel fernández said in a speech that a person’s transition could be accepted by the church under “exceptional circumstances” — but maintained that “gender ideology” represents a “claim to omnipotence,” threatening divine authority.

did pope francis support lgbtq+ parents and adoption rights?
on this, the pope took a much clearer stance: not on your life. if a “marriage” is no longer between a man and a woman, then-cardinal bergoglio wrote in his 2010 letter to the carmelite nuns, adopted children will be irrevocably harmed from growing up with gay parents. “at stake are the lives of so many children who will be discriminated against in advance,” he lamented, “depriving them of the human maturation that god wanted to be given with a father and a mother.” (it should be noted that children raised by lgbtq+ parents develop the same way their peers do, and may even have some advantages.)

francis did not officially change his stance after becoming pope. in 2013, a bishop reported that the pope was “shocked” by a civil union bill in malta that would have allowed lgbtq+ couples to adopt. the year after, francis reiterated that children have “a right to grow up in a family with a father and a mother” and warned against being tempted towards “the poisonous environment of the temporary.”

did the pope at least like my pets?
bad news! owning pets is also a metaphysical threat to the fabric of reality, even for straights. “many, many couples do not have children because they do not want to, or they have just one — but they have two dogs, two cats,” francis said in 2022, calling the trend a “denial of fatherhood or motherhood” that “diminishes us” and “takes away our humanity.” we can only imagine what the guy thinks of sapphics who own more than one litter box.

how did pope francis die?
pope francis died on april 21 — easter monday — after being hospitalized with double pneumonia for five weeks in february and march. italian newspaper la repubblica reported that his death may have been the result of a stroke, though vatican sources had not confirmed the cause at time of writing.

during his recovery, francis continued to make numerous planned trips, including a visit to a rome prison. one of the pope’s final appearances was with u.s. vice president j.d. vance on april 20, several months after francis rebuked vance and the trump administration on immigration and vance’s own comments about “christian love.” (vance converted to catholicism in 2019, and has since aligned himself with a religious movement often referred to as “postliberalism,” whose adherents generally believe that they should seize control of government power to enact anti-lgbtq+ and anti-immigrant policies.)

the vatican stated that in their meeting, francis and vance discussed “the common commitment to protect the right to religious freedom and freedom of conscience.” the two also reportedly held “an exchange of views on the international situation, especially regarding countries affected by war, political tensions and difficult humanitarian situations, with particular attention focused on migrants, refugees and those in prison,” per the vatican.

who will be the next pope?
it’s still not clear who will succeed francis and become the catholic church’s 267th pope. there are several possible options the college of cardinals could select as the new pope during the imminent conclave; at time of writing, some have identified cardinal luis antonio tagle of the philippines as a more progressive frontrunner, noting his similarity to francis’ “pastoral” leadership style (which has reportedly earned him the nickname “the asian francis”). tagle rejected the church’s “harsh words” against lgbtq+ people and divorced or unwed parents during a 2015 speech in london, saying lack of religious acceptance “led to their isolation from the wider society.” but like francis, tagle is not a full-throated defender of gay or trans rights; earlier that same year, tagle also backed francis’ description of the global lgbtq+ rights movement as “ideological colonization,” lamenting to reporters that foreign aid to african nations was conditional on bishops embracing “alien” views on topics like same-sex marriage.

also among the best-case papal scenarios for lgbtq+ catholics is polish cardinal konrad krajewski, another likely member of the college’s shortlist, vatican expert john l. allen jr. told the new york post. as the head of francis’ dicastery for the service of charity, krajewski was the face of the church’s international aid and charitable works, visiting gaza in december 2023 and more recently delivering several ambulances to ukraine. krajewski also distributed monetary aid to the group of trans women with whom francis later shared pasta.

“i don’t understand why this is getting so much attention,” krajewski told reuters at the time. “this is ordinary work for the church, it’s normal. this is how the church is a field hospital.”","['leader', 'catholic', 'church', 'late', 'pope', 'francis', 'née', 'cardinal', 'jorge', 'mario', 'bergoglio', 'establish', 'boundary', 'push', 'pope', 'modern', 'history', 'lead',

fad9e4b0-b54f-44b9-810c-1423f400cfc2,pro,u.k. minister says trans women should use bathrooms that correspond to their “biological sex”,"['minister', 'say', 'trans', 'woman', 'use', 'bathroom', 'correspond', 'biological', 'sex']",them,abby monteil,https://www.them.us/story/bridget-phillipson-uk-trans-women-bathrooms,4/22/2025,"the u.k. department of education’s minister for women and equalities, bridget phillipson, said that trans women should use bathrooms that correspond with their sex assigned at birth, although she stopped short of explicitly saying that trans women should use men’s restrooms.

phillipson, who is a member of the u.k.’s ruling labour party, appeared on tuesday’s edition of bbc radio 4’s today program. during the interview, bbc presenter anna foster asked her which public restroom trans women should use following the u.k. supreme court’s april 16 ruling that the legal definitions of “man” and “woman” in the 2010 equality act are based on a person’s “biological sex” as assigned at birth. it is a question that another labour minister, mp karin smyth, seemed unable to answer last week.

phillipson appears to have more clarity. sort of. “the ruling was clear that provisions and services should be accessed on the basis of biological sex,” phillipson said.

she added that the u.k.’s equality and human rights commission (ehrc) “will be setting out additional guidance and a statutory code of practice, because we need to make sure that everyone has the ability to access services that are safe and appropriate, and respect their privacy and dignity.”

according to the bbc, the equality act 2010 allows for single-sex spaces and services that aren’t considered discriminatory, when a user can reasonably object to the space being open to members of the opposite sex. last week’s supreme court ruling means that even if a trans woman has a gender recognition certificate, she can be barred from a woman’s single-sex space like a bathroom.

foster continued to press phillipson during their interview, replying, “and just for clarity… if you are a trans woman, you’re out in public, you need to use the toilet today, it is the men’s toilet that you use?”

phillipson repeated her first response verbatim before continuing, “i know that many businesses, large and small, will ensure that they have appropriate provisions in place. for example, many businesses have moved towards unisex provision or separate [bathroom] cubicles that can be used by anyone.”

foster pointed out that in some cases, “that third space doesn’t exist yet.”

“in many cases, those do already exist, including in small businesses,” phillipson replied. “they do. go into your local café, a local family café, chances are, you’ll have one cubicle that’s self-contained, that can be used by anyone.”

phillipson’s public position on which bathrooms trans women should use has shifted since last june, when the labour party announced plans to streamline the process that allows trans people to get approval for gender recognition certificates (grcs), the document that changes a person’s recorded sex, and registered trans women as legally female and trans men as legally male. the plan would have made it less burdensome for trans people to meet the criteria required to obtain grcs.

when phillipson was pressed on which bathrooms trans women with gender recognition certificates should use during a june times radio interview, she responded, “i would expect that if you were someone that had gone through that formal process of recognition you are, to all intents and purposes, for legal purposes, regarded as being in a different gender regardless of the sex into which you were born… i would think that in those cases people would be using female toilets.”

phillipson isn’t the first government minister who could or would not explain which public bathrooms trans people are now expected to use following the supreme court’s ruling. when karin smyth, minister of state for the department of health and social care, was asked whether trans women can use women’s services and facilities during a times radio interview, she told the outlet that it is a “large complex issue” that “varies upon what the provision of those service providers are.”

labour party leader and current prime minister keir starmer, who said last year that he opposes “gender ideology” and that “biological women’s spaces need to be protected,” praised the ruling shortly after it was issued last week. on tuesday, the bbc reported that a spokesperson for starmer said that he does not believe transgender women are women. this is a change from starmer’s position just a few years ago; in 2022, when he was an mp and leader of the opposition party, he said that trans women are women.

“no, the supreme court judgment has made clear that when looking at the equality act, a woman is a biological woman,” the spokesperson stated.

according to u.k. legal experts and lgbtq+ advocacy groups, the ruling may have sweeping negative consequences not only for trans people, but for intersex people and cis women as well.

“we’re yet to see how all of this will play out in practice, but it seems clear that this won’t just hurt the trans community. the reasoning adopted, and the relentless desire to police ‘what is a woman’ can only hurt our wider communities,” legal researcher jess o’thomson wrote for the u.k.-based lgbtq+ website queeraf last wednesday. “now is the time to work in solidarity with other marginalised groups, and resist an establishment which wants to force us into even smaller boxes.”","['department', 'education', 'minister', 'woman', 'equality', 'bridget', 'phillipson', 'say', 'trans', 'woman', 'use', 'bathroom', 'correspond', 'sex', 'assign', 'birth', 'stop', 'short', 'explicitly', 'say', 'trans', 'woman', 'use', 'man', 'restroom', 'phillipson', 'member', 'rule', 'labour', 'party', 'appear', 'tuesday', 'edition', 'bbc', 'radio', 'today', 'program', 'interview', 'bbc', 'presenter', 'anna', 'foster', 'ask', 'public', 'restroom', 'trans', 'woman', 'use', 'follow', 'supreme', 'court', 'april', 'ruling', 'legal', 'definition', 'man', 'woman', 'equality', 'act', 'base', 'person', 'biological', 'sex', 'assign', 'birth', 'question', 'labour', 'minister', 'mp', 'karin', 'smyth', 'unable', 'answer', 'week', 'phillipson', 'appear', 'clarity', 'sort', 'ruling', 'clear', 'provision', 'service', 'access', 'basis', 'biological', 'sex', 'phillipson', 'say', 'add', 'equality', 'human', 'right', 'commission', 'ehrc', 'set', 'additional', 'guidance', 'statutory', 'code', 'practice', 'need', 'sure', 'ability', 'access', 'service', 'safe', 'appropriate', 'respect', 'privacy', 'dignity', 'accord', 'bbc', 'equality', 'act', 'allow', 'single', 'sex', 'space', 'service', 'consider', 'discriminatory', 'user', 'reasonably', 'object', 'space', 'open', 'member', 'opposite', 'sex', 'week', 'supreme', 'court', 'ruling', 'mean', 'trans', 'woman', 'gender', 'recognition', 'certificate', 'bar', 'woman', 'single', 'sex', 'space', 'like', 'bathroom', 'foster', 'continue', 'press', 'phillipson', 'interview', 'reply', 'clarity', 'trans', 'woman', 'public', 'need', 'use', 'toilet', 'today', 'man', 'toilet', 'use', 'phillipson', 'repeat', 'response', 'verbatim', 'continue', 'know', 'business', 'large', 'small', 'ensure', 'appropriate', 'provision', 'place', 'example', 'business', 'move', 'unisex', 'provision', 'separate', 'bathroom', 'cubicle', 'foster', 'point', 'case', 'space', 'exist', 'case', 'exist', 'include', 'small', 'business', 'phillipson', 'reply', 'local', 'café', 'local', 'family', 'café', 'chance', 'cubicle', 'self', 'contain', 'phillipson', 'public', 'position', 'bathroom', 'tran', 'woman', 'use', 'shift', 'june', 'labour', 'party', 'announce', 'plan', 'streamline', 'process', 'allow', 'trans', 'people', 'approval', 'gender', 'recognition', 'certificate', 'grcs', 'document', 'change', 'person', 'record', 'sex', 'register', 'tran', 'woman', 'legally', 'female', 'tran', 'man', 'legally', 'male', 'plan', 'burdensome', 'tran', 'people', 'meet', 'criterion', 'require', 'obtain', 'grcs', 'phillipson', 'press', 'bathroom', 'tran', 'woman', 'gender', 'recognition', 'certificate', 'use', 'june', 'time', 'radio', 'interview', 'respond', 'expect', 'go', 'formal', 'process', 'recognition', 'intent', 'purpose', 'legal', 'purpose', 'regard', 'different', 'gender', 'regardless', 'sex', 'bear', 'think', 'case', 'people', 'female', 'toilet', 'phillipson', 'government', 'minister', 'explain', 'public', 'bathroom', 'trans', 'people', 'expect', 'use', 'follow', 'supreme', 'court', 'ruling', 'karin', 'smyth', 'minister', 'state', 'department', 'health', 'social', 'care', 'ask', 'tran', 'woman', 'use', 'woman', 'service', 'facility', 'time', 'radio', 'interview', 'tell', 'outlet', 'large', 'complex', 'issue', 'vary', 'provision', 'service', 'provider', 'labour', 'party', 'leader', 'current', 'prime', 'minister', 'keir', 'starmer', 'say', 'year', 'oppose', 'gender', 'ideology', 'biological', 'woman', 'space', 'need', 'protect', 'praise', 'ruling', 'shortly', 'issue', 'week', 'tuesday', 'bbc', 'report', 'spokesperson', 'starmer', 'say', 'believe', 'transgender', 'woman', 'woman', 'change', 'starmer', 'position', 'year', 'ago', 'mp', 'leader', 'opposition', 'party', 'say', 'trans', 'woman', 'woman', 'supreme', 'court', 'judgment', 'clear', 'look', 'equality', 'act', 'woman', 'biological', 'woman', 'spokesperson', 'state', 'accord', 'legal', 'expert', 'advocacy', 'group', 'ruling', 'sweep', 'negative', 'consequence', 'tran', 'people', 'intersex', 'people', 'cis', 'woman', 'play', 'practice', 'clear', 'will', 'hurt', 'trans', 'community', 'reasoning', 'adopt', 'relentless', 'desire', 'police', 'woman', 'hurt', 'wide', 'community', 'legal', 'researcher', 'jess', 'write', 'website', 'queeraf', 'wednesday', 'time', 'work', 'solidarity', 'marginalised', 'group', 'resist', 'establishment', 'want', 'force', 'small', 'box']",
8e60fe81-0c1a-4a26-bd85-893ccc63842d,pro,u.k. supreme court rules that trans men are not men and trans women are not women,"['supreme', 'court', 'rule', 'trans', 'man', 'man', 'tran', 'woman', 'woman']",them,samantha riedel,https://www.them.us/story/uk-supreme-court-decision-equality-act-trans-gender-recognition-certificate-consequences,4/16/2025,"the u.k. supreme court ruled on wednesday that the legal definitions of “man” and “woman” are based on a person’s “biological sex” as assigned at birth. anti-transgender activists hailed the decision, though legal experts say its full ramifications are still unclear.

the court issued its ruling with a unanimous 5-0 decision in the case for women scotland v. the scottish ministers. for women scotland (fws) is an anti-trans advocacy group founded in june 2018 specifically to challenge changes to scotland’s gender recognition act, arguing to the u.k.’s highest court that scotland should not be allowed to include trans women who have gender recognition certificates (grcs) as “women” for the purposes of meeting gender equity quotas on public boards. the five justices largely sided with fws in this week’s decision, writing that including cis and trans women in the same legal sex category “would cut across the definitions of ‘man’ and ‘woman’ and thus the protected characteristic of sex in an incoherent way.”

“the meaning of the terms “sex”, “man,” and “woman’” — as used in the u.k.’s equality act 2010, which bars discrimination based on sex, sexual orientation, and “gender reassignment” — “refer to biological sex, as any other interpretation would render the ea 2010 incoherent and impracticable to operate,” the court ruled. trans people will still theoretically be able to bring “gender reassignment” discrimination claims under the ea 2010, per the ruling, whether they have a grc or not. but a grc will no longer hold weight in establishing a person’s legal “sex,” meaning that trans women will legally be classed as “male,” trans men as “female,” and nonbinary people as their birth-assigned sex.

advocates in the u.k. expressed dismay and surprise at wednesday’s ruling, but warned that the full 88-page decision is still incompletely understood, and will take time to interpret and implement. it’s not clear how far-ranging the court’s ruling will be: as the associated press reported, it will likely affect scottish trans people’s ability to serve on the boards of public bodies. other effects are still up in the air, but numerous sections of the decision are nonetheless chilling and could be far-ranging, legal researcher jess o’thomson explained on u.k. lgbtq+ news site queeraf on wednesday.

as thomson noted, some passages of the decision appear to be based in part on whether a given trans person “passes” for cis in their lived gender identity, and could exclude trans people from single-sex spaces depending on whether a cis observer has a “reasonable objection” to their presence based on appearance. (the u.k.’s ruling labour party told reuters the decision would “bring clarity” to the debate over legal rights and stated that “[s]ingle-sex spaces are protected in law and will always be protected by this government.”) other passages refer to a hypothetical trans woman as “a man who identifies as a woman,” declares that misogyny as an oppressive system is generally rooted in cis women’s “shared biology,” and strictly defines the word “lesbian” as “a [afab] female who is sexually oriented towards (or attracted to) [afab] females,” thomson observed.

“there’s no easy way to put it - this decision is terrible for trans people. i have no doubt it will be used as a rallying point for even further attacks on our rights,” thomson wrote. “we’re yet to see how all of this will play out in practice, but it seems clear that this won’t just hurt the trans community.”

fws and other anti-trans campaigners celebrated the ruling, with fws co-director susan smith telling the ap that the decision was “common sense” because a person “can’t change” their sex, and went on to accuse trans people of having “tried to deny science and to deny reality.” fws funded their legal challenge in part through a public fundraiser, to which children’s author-turned-anti-trans figurehead j.k. rowling reportedly donated £70,000 in 2024 — at the time, roughly equivalent to $88,200.

although the court allowed outside testimony from anti-trans groups such as the nonprofit sex matters — and even praised sex matters’ legal counsel ben cooper kc for providing “focus and structure to the argument that ‘sex,’ ‘man’ and ‘woman’ should be given a biological meaning” — no trans people were allowed to weigh in on the appeal. the court denied a formal request last year by the good law project to accept testimony from trans legal experts dr. victoria mccloud and prof. stephen whittle. “[w]e think it was wrong of the supreme court to decide not to hear from any trans voices, even though they’re the only ones whose rights are on the line,” representatives for the project wrote at the time.

the edinburgh-based advocacy group scottish trans wrote that its members were “shocked and disappointed” by the ruling in a press release wednesday, saying the court’s decision “undercuts the central purpose of the gender recognition act” and goes against 20 years of equality law in the u.k.

“this judgement appears to have limited the scope of gender recognition so that trans people’s gender will no longer be recognised in many circumstances,” scottish trans representatives wrote, adding that they will “continue working for a world in which trans people can get on with our lives with privacy, dignity and safety.”

holly greenberry-pullen, co-founder of the intersex rights advocacy group intersexuk, called the court’s decision “mental” in a statement to the independent, saying that the court ignored the lived realities of intersex people to reinforce simplistic sex norms.

“[w]e clearly and unequivocally prove based on our biology that biological sex and its huge wealth of variations highlight that sex is not binary,” greenberry-pullen said, calling the ruling “politically charged and factually flawed.”","['supreme', 'court', 'rule', 'wednesday', 'legal', 'definition', 'man', 'woman', 'base', 'person', 'biological', 'sex', 'assign', 'birth', 'anti',

but there is hope—and real momentum.

the tipping point: president trump’s bold action

on february 5, 2025, president trump signed a landmark executive order: “keeping men out of women’s sports.” the order bans biological males from competing in women’s sports at all public schools and universities—a massive win for fairness, science, and sanity.

following this decisive leadership, even the ncaa—a longtime enabler of trans inclusion—updated its policies to match the new federal standard. these victories are a testament to growing public pressure and a nationwide demand for common sense in athletics.

but let’s be clear: this battle is far from over.

add your name to the petition to demand fairness in women’s sports!

the fight continues—even in the face of progress

despite these victories, many athletic programs across the country continue to allow men to compete against women. worse still, international bodies like the olympic committee persist in legitimizing this unfairness. as america prepares to host the 2028 olympic games, we face a pivotal moment.

if we don’t act now, the world will watch our nation betray its own female athletes on our own soil.

this isn’t just bad policy—it’s a war on women.

real women, real losses

female athletes are already paying the price. selina soule, once a top high school sprinter in connecticut, saw her dreams crushed as biological males dominated her events—stealing not only titles but chances to advance in her sport.

taylor silverman, a professional skateboarder, has lost to biological men in multiple competitions. despite backlash for speaking out, she continues to bravely advocate for fairness—becoming a symbol of resistance against this ideological takeover.

and just last month, stephanie turner, a female fencer, refused to compete against a transgender male at a maryland tournament. for taking a knee in protest, she was disqualified. now she’s set to testify before congress on may 7, alongside usa fencing’s chairman—who has publicly supported trans inclusion.

these women are not alone. over 800,000 people have already signed the petition to save women’s sports.

will you join them?

the science is clear and the stakes are high

this isn’t complicated. men and women are biologically different, and those differences matter—especially in competitive sports. female athletes spend years training, practicing, and sacrificing to compete at the highest levels. yet all of that can be erased the moment they’re forced to line up against a biological male.

we’re watching the integrity of women’s sports disintegrate before our eyes. unless we stand up and say “enough,” future generations of girls won’t have the chance to compete on a level playing field.

prageru is leading the charge

prageru is educating millions of americans with free videos that expose the truth about biological differences and the radical agenda threatening our culture. as a leading conservative nonprofit, prageru is empowering citizens to push back—and change the conversation.

but to keep winning, we need your voice.

take action now

add your name to the petition. make your voice heard. tell our leaders, athletic organizations, and the world: men do not belong in women’s sports.","['woman', 'girl', 'america', 'attack', 'country', 'global', 'stage', 'biological', 'man', 'continue', 'invade', 'woman', 'sport', 'rob', 'female', 'athlete', 'opportunity', 'title', 'scholarship', 'dream', 'courageous', 'voice', 'speak', 'far', 'institution', 'continue', 'cave', 'radical', 'gender', 'ideology', 'defend', 'fairness', 'truth', 'hope', 'real', 'momentum', 'tipping', 'point', 'president', 'trump', 'bold', 'action', 'february', 'president', 'trump', 'sign', 'landmark', 'executive', 'order', 'keep', 'man', 'woman', 'sport', 'order', 'ban', 'biological', 'male', 'compete', 'woman', 'sport', 'public', 'school', 'university', 'massive', 'win', 'fairness', 'science', 'sanity', 'follow', 'decisive', 'leadership', 'ncaa', 'longtime', 'enabler', 'trans', 'inclusion', 'update', 'policy', 'match', 'new', 'federal', 'standard', 'victory', 'testament', 'grow', 'public', 'pressure', 'nationwide', 'demand', 'common', 'sense', 'athletic', 'let', 'clear', 'battle', 'far', 'add', 'petition', 'demand', 'fairness', 'woman', 'sport', 'fight', 'continue', 'face', 'progress', 'despite', 'victory', 'athletic', 'program', 'country', 'continue', 'allow', 'man', 'compete', 'woman', 'worse', 'international', 'body', 'like', 'olympic', 'committee', 'persist', 'legitimize', 'unfairness', 'america', 'prepare', 'host', 'olympic', 'game', 'face', 'pivotal', 'moment', 'act', 'world', 'watch', 'nation', 'betray', 'female', 'athlete', 'soil', 'bad', 'policy', 'war', 'woman', 'real', 'woman', 'real', 'loss', 'female', 'athlete', 'pay', 'price', 'selina', 'soule', 'high', 'school', 'sprinter', 'connecticut', 'see', 'dream', 'crush', 'biological', 'male', 'dominate', 'event', 'steal', 'title', 'chance', 'advance', 'sport', 'taylor', 'silverman', 'professional', 'skateboarder', 'lose', 'biological', 'man', 'multiple', 'competition', 'despite', 'backlash', 'speak', 'continue', 'bravely', 'advocate', 'fairness', 'symbol', 'resistance', 'ideological', 'takeover', 'month', 'stephanie', 'turner', 'female', 'fencer', 'refuse', 'compete', 'transgender', 'male', 'maryland', 'tournament', 'take', 'knee', 'protest', 'disqualify', 'set', 'testify', 'congress', 'alongside', 'usa', 'fencing', 'chairman', 'publicly', 'support', 'trans', 'inclusion', 'woman', 'people', 'sign', 'petition', 'save', 'woman', 'sport', 'join', 'science', 'clear', 'stake', 'high', 'complicated', 'man', 'woman', 'biologically', 'different', 'difference', 'matter', 'especially', 'competitive', 'sport', 'female', 'athlete', 'spend', 'year', 'training', 'practice', 'sacrifice', 'compete', 'high', 'level', 'erase', 'moment', 'force', 'line', 'biological', 'male', 'watch', 'integrity', 'woman', 'sport', 'disintegrate', 'eye', 'stand', 'future', 'generation', 'girl', 'will', 'chance', 'compete', 'level', 'playing', 'field', 'prageru', 'lead', 'charge', 'prageru', 'educate', 'million', 'americans', 'free', 'video', 'expose', 'truth', 'biological', 'difference', 'radical', 'agenda', 'threaten', 'culture', 'lead', 'conservative', 'nonprofit', 'prageru', 'empower', 'citizen', 'push', 'change', 'conversation', 'win', 'need', 'voice', 'action', 'add', 'petition', 'voice', 'hear', 'tell', 'leader', 'athletic', 'organization', 'world', 'man', 'belong', 'woman', 'sport']",

a report released by the nashville metropolitan police department (nmpd) shows that in december 2018, the transgender-identifying individual begin formulating a plan to attack creswell middle school. she had attended creswell during her middle school years and came away emotionally distressed.

nmpd described what she planned to do:

she drew a map from her memories of the layout of the school. in the map, she specified the locations of classrooms, common areas, and where the entrances and exits were located. she outlined how she would progress through the school, who she would target and in what sequence, and where she would commit suicide within the school once she was done. knowing access to the interior of the school was highly restricted during school hours, she detailed an elaborate plan to enter the school without being stopped or detected so she could begin her attack with the element of surprise.

during the first six months of 2019 she continued plans to target creswell: “her ocd was manifest during this time with the excruciating detail she gave to the attack, including precise timelines, detailed descriptions of the clothing she would wear, and the specific route she would progress through the school. the more she pored over the details, the more convinced she was of her own success. the ‘rage storms’ that interspersed these plans also became more heated, showing hale’s anger was reaching the boiling point.”

she brooded over her plan extensively, wanting to become a “god” as she believed the columbine killers had done. she would follow in their steps “by killing victims nobody would forget: children.”

however, by march 2020 the transgender-identifying individual’s thinking began to change, the police report detailed:

hale began to express doubts about targeting creswell middle. her doubts weren’t necessarily about the intention to kill children, but more about the racial demographics of the school. hale knew a large portion of the student body was black. though she had no qualms about killing anyone regardless of specific demographical categories, she worried she might be branded as a racist, which would remove her ability to give the motive and reasoning for the attack and [instead] allow others to choose it for her once she was dead.

she continued to plan to attack creswell until april 8, 2021, at which time she shifted her plan to the covenant christian school. she believed covenant was a better target for three reasons:  “(1) [it] was more geographically isolated than creswell middle, which she felt would give her more time to kill; (2) … being a private christian school, she would receive more notoriety; and (3) due to the student body at creswell middle being predominantly black, she was afraid she would be seen as a racist…”

the threat of the racism label made her worry that the motive for the attack and narrative of it would spin out of control once she died.","['transgender', 'identify', 'woman', 'shoot', 'kill', 'innocent', 'nashville', 'christian', 'school', 'march', 'originally', 'plan', 'shoot', 'school', 'abandon', 'plan', 'avoid', 'look', 'racist', 'report', 'release', 'nashville', 'metropolitan', 'police', 'department', 'nmpd', 'show', 'december', 'transgender', 'identify', 'individual', 'begin', 'formulate', 'plan', 'attack', 'creswell', 'middle', 'school', 'attend', 'creswell', 'middle', 'school', 'year', 'come', 'away', 'emotionally', 'distressed', 'nmpd', 'describe', 'plan', 'draw', 'map', 'memory', 'layout', 'school', 'map', 'specify', 'location', 'classroom', 'common', 'area', 'entrance', 'exit', 'locate', 'outline', 'progress', 'school', 'target', 'sequence', 'commit', 'suicide', 'school', 'know', 'access', 'interior', 'school', 'highly', 'restrict', 'school', 'hour', 'detail', 'elaborate', 'plan', 'enter', 'school', 'stop', 'detect', 'begin', 'attack', 'element', 'surprise', 'month', 'continue', 'plan', 'target', 'creswell', 'ocd', 'manifest', 'time', 'excruciating', 'detail', 'give', 'attack', 'include', 'precise', 'timeline', 'detailed', 'description', 'clothing', 'wear', 'specific', 'route', 'progress', 'school', 'pore', 'detail', 'convinced', 'success', 'rage', 'storm', 'intersperse', 'plan', 'heated', 'show', 'hale', 'anger', 'reach', 'boiling', 'point', 'brood', 'plan', 'extensively', 'want', 'god', 'believe', 'columbine', 'killers', 'follow', 'step', 'kill', 'victim', 'forget', 'child', 'march', 'transgender', 'identify', 'individual', 'thinking', 'begin', 'change', 'police', 'report', 'detailed', 'hale', 'begin', 'express', 'doubt', 'target', 'creswell', 'middle', 'doubt', 'necessarily', 'intention', 'kill', 'child', 'racial', 'demographic', 'school', 'hale', 'know', 'large', 'portion', 'student', 'body', 'black', 'qualm', 'kill', 'regardless', 'specific', 'demographical', 'category', 'worry', 'brand', 'racist', 'remove', 'ability', 'motive', 'reasoning', 'attack', 'instead', 'allow', 'choose', 'dead', 'continue', 'plan', 'attack', 'creswell', 'april', 'time', 'shift', 'plan', 'covenant', 'christian', 'school', 'believe', 'covenant', 'well', 'target', 'reason', 'geographically', 'isolate', 'creswell', 'middle', 'feel', 'time', 'kill', 'private', 'christian', 'school', 'receive', 'notoriety', 'student', 'body', 'creswell', 'middle', 'predominantly', 'black', 'afraid', 'see', 'racist', 'threat', 'racism', 'label', 'worry', 'motive', 'attack', 'narrative', 'spin', 'control', 'die']",

ellison said, “[w]e’re always open to a conversation, but we cannot compromise on people’s basic human rights. that we cannot compromise on. as long as the trump administration is willing to work something out that protects the rights of minnesota kids, yeah, we’re open to a dialogue.”

he added, “[w]e are talking about a very small number of people. i’m not sure we even have more than ten. i think we probably have about that or maybe even fewer. and then when you divide them into trans boys or trans girls, you’re even talking about a smaller number, still. so, i think that it is important to understand that our society and the trump administration is literally making a massive deal out of a very small number of children who are trying to play sports. … and we are talking about kids as young as 5 and 6 years old. we’re talking about kids 11, 12. people want to emphasize some 18, 19-year-old kid or somebody else. no, we’re talking about junior high and lower kids, often. and so, i ask kids keep — i ask people to keep that in mind too.”

later, in response to a question on public opinion on trans athletes, ellison said that he is following the law and “do we really want people’s constitutional rights to be a matter of polling, right? i guarantee you that, in 1961, if you were to do a poll on whether or not we should get rid of jim crow, that poll might not have [come] out the way we would have hoped it would in 2025. and i can tell you that, when martin luther king died, he was actually pretty unpopular.”

ellison further stated that if he could talk to president trump, “i’d try to help him understand that transgender folks have some of the highest incidents of depression, anxiety, and even suicide, are often bullied, are often beat up. and being a part of youth sports is something that helps give them some sense of belonging and a sense of confidence.”

ellison also said that he hasn’t seen any proof from the trump administration of women’s rights being violated, but “i can prove the number of transgender people who have been attacked, who’ve been even murdered and killed and people…who suffer great mental and emotional peril because of their exclusion and isolation in our society.”","['interview', 'fox', 'minneapolis', 'st', 'paul', 'tuesday', 'minnesota', 'attorney', 'general', 'keith', 'ellison', 'd', 'discuss', 'state', 'lawsuit', 'trump', 'administration', 'attempt', 'biological', 'man', 'compete', 'woman', 'sport', 'state', 'trump', 'administration', 'literally', 'make', 'massive', 'deal', 'small', 'number', 'child', 'try', 'play', 'sport', 'compromise', 'people', 'basic', 'human', 'right', 'ellison', 'state', 'talk', 'kid', 'young', 'year', 'old', 'talk', 'kid', 'people', 'want', 'emphasize', 'year', 'old', 'kid', 'somebody', 'talk', 'junior', 'high', 'low', 'kid', 'ellison', 'say', 'open', 'conversation', 'compromise', 'people', 'basic', 'human', 'right', 'compromise', 'long', 'trump', 'administration', 'willing', 'work', 'protect', 'right', 'minnesota', 'kid', 'yeah', 'open', 'dialogue', 'add', 'talk', 'small', 'number', 'people', 'sure', 'think', 'probably', 'maybe', 'few', 'divide', 'trans', 'boy', 'tran', 'girl', 'talk', 'small', 'number', 'think', 'important', 'understand', 'society', 'trump', 'administration', 'literally', 'make', 'massive', 'deal', 'small', 'number', 'child', 'try', 'play', 'sport', 'talk', 'kid', 'young', 'year', 'old', 'talk', 'kid', 'people', 'want', 'emphasize', 'year', 'old', 'kid', 'somebody', 'talk', 'junior', 'high', 'low', 'kid', 'ask', 'kid', 'ask', 'people', 'mind', 'later', 'response', 'question', 'public', 'opinion', 'trans', 'athlete', 'ellison', 'say', 'follow', 'law', 'want', 'people', 'constitutional', 'right', 'matter', 'polling', 'right', 'guarantee', 'poll', 'rid', 'jim', 'crow', 'poll', 'come', 'way', 'hope', 'tell', 'martin', 'luther', 'king', 'die', 'actually', 'pretty', 'unpopular', 'ellison', 'state', 'talk', 'president', 'trump', 'try', 'help', 'understand', 'transgender', 'folk', 'high', 'incident', 'depression', 'anxiety', 'suicide', 'bully', 'beat', 'youth', 'sport', 'help', 'sense', 'belong', 'sense', 'confidence', 'ellison', 'say', 'see', 'proof', 'trump', 'administration', 'woman', 'right', 'violate', 'prove', 'number', 'transgender', 'people', 'attack', 'murder', 'kill', 'people', 'suffer', 'great', 'mental', 'emotional', 'peril', 'exclusion', 'isolation', 'society']",

video shows the transgender activist — presumably transgender himself — taking issue with mace using the word “babe.”

“does your husband call you babe?” the individual asked in a more feminine voice.

mace told the individual that she was not married, to which the individual responded, “ok, so even better.”

“i don’t care,” mace said of the transgender activist’s critique over her use of the word “babe.”

“ok, so i would like you to apologize because it is derogatory, and second of all,” the individual continued before mace asked, “is tranny derogatory?”

“well yeah,” the same individual said, but now with an incredibly different, masculine voice after seemingly being thrown off guard by mace’s question.

“of course it f*cking is,” the individual added, again, with the deep, masculine voice that was not present earlier in the conversation.

mace stood her ground, repeating the word “tranny.” at that point, the individual picked up a plant near mace, but it remains unclear what the plan was from there. mace said on social media that her security moved in after the individual picked up the plant.

“they moved in. we had 6 armed guards tonight,” she wrote, remarking on other comments as well.

this is hardly mace’s first run-in with a transgender activist, as they have continued to target her for speaking out against biological men going in women’s spaces — such as restrooms or changing areas.

one tried to rush the stage at one of her events months ago, and another allegedly assaulted her the following month.

mace, however, has continued to stand her ground.

“i’m not going to allow biological men into women’s private spaces,” mace said. “i will stand in the brink and stand in the way of anyone on the radical left who thinks that it’s ok for a penis to be in a women’s locker room or a bathroom or a changing room. hell no, i’m not going to stand for it.”","['rep', 'nancy', 'mace', 'r', 'sc', 'stand', 'strong', 'advocate', 'woman', 'space', 'contend', 'belong', 'biological', 'woman', 'biological', 'woman', 'confrontation', 'transgender', 'activist', 'voice', 'suddenly', 'significantly', 'deep', 'irritation', 'congresswoman', 'response', 'complaint', 'video', 'show', 'transgender', 'activist', 'presumably', 'transgender', 'take', 'issue', 'mace', 'word', 'babe', 'husband', 'babe', 'individual', 'ask', 'feminine', 'voice', 'mace', 'tell', 'individual', 'marry', 'individual', 'respond', 'ok', 'well', 'care', 'mace', 'say', 'transgender', 'activist', 'critique', 'use', 'word', 'babe', 'ok', 'like', 'apologize', 'derogatory', 'second', 'individual', 'continue', 'mace', 'ask', 'tranny', 'derogatory', 'yeah', 'individual', 'say', 'incredibly', 'different', 'masculine', 'voice', 'seemingly', 'throw', 'guard', 'mace', 'question', 'course', 'individual', 'add', 'deep', 'masculine', 'voice', 'present', 'early', 'conversation', 'mace', 'stand', 'ground', 'repeat', 'word', 'tranny', 'point', 'individual', 'pick', 'plant', 'near', 'mace', 'remain', 'unclear', 'plan', 'mace', 'say', 'social', 'medium', 'security', 'move', 'individual', 'pick', 'plant', 'move', 'armed', 'guard', 'tonight', 'write', 'remark', 'comment', 'hardly', 'mace', 'run', 'transgender', 'activist', 'continue', 'target', 'speak', 'biological', 'man', 'go', 'woman', 'space', 'restroom', 'change', 'area', 'try', 'rush', 'stage', 'event', 'month', 'ago', 'allegedly', 'assault', 'follow', 'month', 'mace', 'continue', 'stand', 'ground', 'go', 'allow', 'biological', 'man', 'woman', 'private', 'space', 'mace', 'say', 'stand', 'brink', 'stand', 'way', 'radical', 'left', 'think', 'ok', 'penis', 'woman', 'locker', 'room', 'bathroom', 'change', 'room', 'hell', 'go', 'stand']",

“they’ve opened up and changed the organization for the better, which is why i feel so proud to be with this organization rather than some others that maybe aren’t so open and welcoming to all women,” st. cyr said.

notably, bill belichick’s girlfriend, jordon hudson, will also be competing for the 2025 miss maine usa title.

“happy international pageant day,” hudson wrote in an instagram post last week, adding, “i couldn’t think of a better day to share with the world that i will be competing for miss maine usa 2025; representing my hometown, hancock.”

miss maine usa, which operates under the miss universe organization, reportedly changed its rules in 2012 to allow men to complete.

contestants “must represent and warrant that you are a female” and be “recognized medically and legally as a female in the united states” in order to participate, according to miss maine usa’s website.

st. cyr told bangor daily news that he believes this means every contestant’s birth certificate must list them as female, and transgender contestants will have to work with a doctor to get their documents changed.

while the trans contestant is the first man to compete for miss maine usa, he is not the only male to participate in a national pageant.

as breitbart news reported, kataluna enriquez, a biological male who identifies as a woman, won the title of miss nevada usa in 2021.

notably, st. cyr’s entry into the pageant arrives during president donald trump’s second term in the white house.

on friday, president trump’s department of education (doe) announced that it has begun the process of cutting federal k-12 funding to maine, as the democrat-run state continues to allow males who identify as females to compete in girls’ and women’s sports.","['transgender', 'miss', 'maine', 'usa', 'contestant', 'face', 'jordon', 'hudson', 'year', 'old', 'girlfriend', 'head', 'football', 'coach', 'university', 'north', 'carolina', 'chapel', 'hill', 'new', 'england', 'patriot', 'head', 'coach', 'bill', 'belichick', 'isabelle', 'st', 'cyr', 'year', 'old', 'male', 'identify', 'female', 'set', 'compete', 'miss', 'maine', 'usa', 'pageant', 'month', 'portland', 'maine', 'make', 'contestant', 'transgender', 'individual', 'title', 'accord', 'report', 'bangor', 'daily', 'news', 'st', 'cyr', 'tell', 'newspaper', 'little', 'nervous', 'compete', 'beauty', 'pageant', 'current', 'political', 'climate', 'claim', 'enter', 'competition', 'political', 'statement', 'sign', 'year', 'ago', 'love', 'pageant', 'happen', 'trans', 'st', 'cyr', 'say', 'want', 'trans', 'woman', 'absolutely', 'pageant', 'trans', 'contestant', 'claim', 'lack', 'education', 'surround', 'pageant', 'welcoming', 'truly', 'open', 'change', 'organization', 'well', 'feel', 'proud', 'organization', 'maybe', 'open', 'welcome', 'woman', 'st', 'cyr', 'say', 'notably', 'bill', 'belichick', 'girlfriend', 'jordon', 'hudson', 'compete', 'miss', 'maine', 'usa', 'title', 'happy', 'international', 'pageant', 'day', 'hudson', 'write', 'instagram', 'post', 'week', 'add', 'think', 'well', 'day', 'share', 'world', 'compete', 'miss', 'maine', 'usa', 'represent', 'hometown', 'hancock', 'miss', 'maine', 'usa', 'operate', 'miss', 'universe', 'organization', 'reportedly', 'change', 'rule', 'allow', 'man', 'complete', 'contestant', 'represent', 'warrant', 'female', 'recognize', 'medically', 'legally', 'female', 'united', 'states', 'order', 'participate', 'accord', 'miss', 'maine', 'usa', 'website', 'st', 'cyr', 'tell', 'bangor', 'daily', 'news', 'believe', 'mean', 'contestant', 'birth', 'certificate', 'list', 'female', 'transgender', 'contestant', 'work', 'doctor', 'document', 'change', 'trans', 'contestant', 'man', 'compete', 'miss', 'maine', 'usa', 'male', 'participate', 'national', 'pageant', 'breitbart', 'news', 'report', 'kataluna', 'enriquez', 'biological', 'male', 'identify', 'woman', 'win', 'title', 'miss', 'nevada', 'usa', 'notably', 'st', 'cyr', 'entry', 'pageant', 'arrive', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'second', 'term', 'white', 'house', 'friday', 'president', 'trump', 'department', 'education', 'doe', 'announce', 'begin', 'process', 'cut', 'federal', 'fund', 'maine', 'democrat', 'run', 'state', 'continue', 'allow', 'male', 'identify', 'female', 'compete', 'girl', 'woman', 'sport']",

the redlands unified school board in southern california’s san bernardino county voted in favor of banning transgender athletes by a vote of 3-2.

“i am just so grateful that this insanity had not entered into society when i was growing up,” said board member candy olson.

“if people think there is no difference between men and women, they are denying science.”

redlands executive trisha keeling took sharp exception to the vote while saying there were no trans athletes in the district. she also accused the trans ban’s proponents of creating a problem where there is none.

“redlands should not and cannot stand for this form of discrimination,” she said.

redlands joins its fellow california school district, chino valley, in voting to ban trans athletes.

“it is not controversial, it is common sense,” said chino valley shaw school board president sonja shaw, who traveled to redlands for the vote. “we are here to make common sense common again.”

the vote comes on the heels of a recent poll of californians, which shows a strong majority of that state’s likely voters disagree with allowing transgender athletes to compete in girls’ sports.

“a new poll found that 65 percent of california likely voters think transgender-identifying athletes should be required to play on teams that match their sex rather than their claimed ‘gender identity,” breitbart’s katherine hamilton reported. “the survey, which was conducted by the nonpartisan public policy institute of california, found that nearly half of democrats in the state agree.”","['school', 'district', 'dark', 'blue', 'california', 'vote', 'ban', 'male', 'compete', 'girl', 'sport', 'redland', 'unify', 'school', 'board', 'southern', 'california', 'san', 'bernardino', 'county', 'vote', 'favor', 'ban', 'transgender', 'athlete', 'vote', 'grateful', 'insanity', 'enter', 'society', 'grow', 'say', 'board', 'member', 'candy', 'olson', 'people', 'think', 'difference', 'man', 'woman', 'deny', 'science', 'redland', 'executive', 'trisha', 'keeling', 'take', 'sharp', 'exception', 'vote', 'say', 'trans', 'athlete', 'district', 'accuse', 'trans', 'ban', 'proponent', 'create', 'problem', 'redland', 'stand', 'form', 'discrimination', 'say', 'redland', 'join', 'fellow', 'california', 'school', 'district', 'chino', 'valley', 'vote', 'ban', 'trans', 'athlete', 'controversial', 'common', 'sense', 'say', 'chino', 'valley', 'shaw', 'school', 'board', 'president', 'sonja', 'shaw', 'travel', 'redland', 'vote', 'common', 'sense', 'common', 'vote', 'come', 'heel', 'recent', 'poll', 'californian', 'show', 'strong', 'majority', 'state', 'likely', 'voter', 'disagree', 'allow', 'transgender', 'athlete', 'compete', 'girl', 'sport', 'new', 'poll', 'find', 'percent', 'california', 'likely', 'voter', 'think', 'transgender', 'identify', 'athlete', 'require', 'play', 'team', 'match', 'sex', 'claim', 'gender', 'identity', 'breitbart', 'katherine', 'hamilton', 'report', 'survey', 'conduct', 'nonpartisan', 'public', 'policy', 'institute', 'california', 'find', 'nearly', 'half', 'democrats', 'state', 'agree']",

on monday, the washington interscholastic activities association (wiaa) announced that the measure, an advisory amendment only since banning trans athletes currently runs afoul of washington state law, earned 31 votes in favor and 22 opposed. while achieving the majority of votes, the measure failed by one vote to win the 60% threshold needed to pass.

“amendment no. 7 received 31 votes in favor and 22 against passing, just one vote shy of being approved. a second amendment, no. 8, would have created a separate ‘open’ division for transgender athletes in washington state. it also would restrict both boys’ and girls’ sports to only allowing athletes who were assigned that sex at birth. amendment no. 8 was much further from passing, with just 13 votes for and 40 against,” king-tv in seattle reports.

in february, president trump reversed the changes to title ix made by the biden administration, stating that sex is the gender someone was assigned at birth, not an identity. the executive order, keeping men out of women’s sports, further empowered federal agencies to investigate and, if necessary, withhold federal funds from entities that refused to comply with the order.

“the president’s order directly contradicts state law, including the washington law against discrimination, and our laws prohibiting discrimination in our public schools. our state law prohibits discrimination on the basis of gender identity, and we will not back down from that,” said washington state superintendent chris reykdal after trump’s executive order was announced. “washington state will do everything in our power to defend the rule of law, states’ rights to establish education policy, and to protect the beautiful diversity of our 1.1 million students and educators. we believe in inclusion over discrimination, and love over hate.”","['proposal', 'block', 'male', 'compete', 'girl', 'sport', 'fail', 'pass', 'youth', 'sport', 'governing', 'body', 'washington', 'state', 'single', 'vote', 'monday', 'washington', 'interscholastic', 'activity', 'association', 'wiaa', 'announce', 'measure', 'advisory', 'amendment', 'ban', 'trans', 'athlete', 'currently', 'run', 'afoul', 'washington', 'state', 'law', 'earn', 'vote', 'favor', 'oppose', 'achieve', 'majority', 'vote', 'measure', 'fail', 'vote', 'win', 'threshold', 'need', 'pass', 'amendment', 'receive', 'vote', 'favor', 'pass', 'vote', 'shy', 'approve', 'second', 'amendment', 'create', 'separate', 'open', 'division', 'transgender', 'athlete', 'washington', 'state', 'restrict', 'boy', 'girl', 'sport', 'allow', 'athlete', 'assign', 'sex', 'birth', 'amendment', 'pass', 'vote', 'king', 'tv', 'seattle', 'report', 'february', 'president', 'trump', 'reverse', 'change', 'title', 'ix', 'biden', 'administration', 'state', 'sex', 'gender', 'assign', 'birth', 'identity', 'executive', 'order', 'keep', 'man', 'woman', 'sport', 'empower', 'federal', 'agency', 'investigate', 'necessary', 'withhold', 'federal', 'fund', 'entity', 'refuse', 'comply', 'order', 'president', 'order', 'directly', 'contradict', 'state', 'law', 'include', 'washington', 'law', 'discrimination', 'law', 'prohibit', 'discrimination', 'public', 'school', 'state', 'law', 'prohibit', 'discrimination', 'basis', 'gender', 'identity', 'say', 'washington', 'state', 'superintendent', 'chris', 'reykdal', 'trump', 'executive', 'order', 'announce', 'washington', 'state', 'power', 'defend', 'rule', 'law', 'state', 'right', 'establish', 'education', 'policy', 'protect', 'beautiful', 'diversity', 'million', 'student', 'educator', 'believe', 'inclusion', 'discrimination', 'love', 'hate']",

bondi on wednesday announced on x that she has asked the doj’s civil rights division to “examine” the case, after a federal judge on monday barred the parents from wearing pink wristbands that say “xx” in reference to female sex chromosomes. 

“i have asked my civil rights division to examine this matter. this doj stands with women and their supportive parents,” bondi said in response to a post from women’s sports advocate riley gaines about the case. 

in september, several parents wore pink wristbands with “xx” on them as a sign of protest during a girls’ high school soccer game where trans-identifying male athlete parker tirrell, now 16, was playing on the other team.

bow and dunbarton school districts superintendent marcy kelley responded to the wristbands by issuing a notice of trespass against the parents, including antony and nicole foote, kyle fellers, and eldon rash, according to local media reports. the no-trespass order has since expired. 

the parents subsequently sued the school district, alleging that their first amendment rights had been violated and asking the judge to allow them to carry signs and wear wristbands featuring “xx” at school events while the case is ongoing.

u.s. district court judge steven mcauliffe, a president george h. w. bush appointee, ultimately sided with the school district and said it acted reasonably in preventing parents from protesting.  

“while plaintiffs may very well have never intended to communicate a demeaning or harassing message directed at parker tirrell or any other transgender students, the symbols and posters they displayed were fully capable of conveying such a message,” he wrote. “and, that broader messaging is what the school authorities reasonably understood and appropriately tried to prevent.”

“the broader and more demeaning/harassing message the school district understood plaintiffs’ ‘xx’ symbols to convey was, in context, entirely reasonable,” he continued. 

a senior attorney for the institute for free speech, one of the attorneys representing the parents, said he disagrees with the court’s decision.

“this was adult speech in a limited public forum, which enjoys greater first amendment protection than student speech in the classroom,” attorney del kolde said in a statement. “bow school district officials were obviously discriminating based on viewpoint because they perceived the xx wristbands to be ‘trans-exclusionary’.”

plaintiffs filed a notice following the ruling saying they do not plan to enter more evidence before the judge issues a final decision, according to the report. 

president donald trump notably signed an executive order on “keeping men out of women’s sports” which seeks protect female student athletes from having “to compete with or against or having to appear unclothed before males.” the order also mandates each federal department “review grants to education programs and, where appropriate, rescind funding to programs that fail to comply with the policy established in this order,” which protects women “as a matter of safety, fairness, dignity, and truth.”","['attorney', 'general', 'pam', 'bondi', 'order', 'department', 'justice', 'doj', 'review', 'case', 'new', 'hampshire', 'parent', 'block', 'protest', 'transgender', 'athlete', 'bondi', 'wednesday', 'announce', 'x', 'ask', 'doj', 'civil', 'right', 'division', 'examine', 'case', 'federal', 'judge', 'monday', 'bar', 'parent', 'wear', 'pink', 'wristband', 'xx', 'reference', 'female', 'sex', 'chromosome', 'ask', 'civil', 'right', 'division', 'examine', 'matter', 'doj', 'stand', 'woman', 'supportive', 'parent', 'bondi', 'say', 'response', 'post', 'woman', 'sport', 'advocate', 'riley', 'gaine', 'case', 'september', 'parent', 'wear', 'pink', 'wristband', 'xx', 'sign', 'protest', 'girl', 'high', 'school', 'soccer', 'game', 'trans', 'identifying', 'male', 'athlete', 'parker', 'tirrell', 'play', 'team', 'bow', 'dunbarton', 'school', 'district', 'superintendent', 'marcy', 'kelley', 'respond', 'wristband', 'issue', 'notice', 'trespass', 'parent', 'include', 'antony', 'nicole', 'foote', 'kyle', 'feller', 'eldon', 'rash', 'accord', 'local', 'medium', 'report', 'trespass', 'order', 'expire', 'parent', 'subsequently', 'sue', 'school', 'district', 'allege', 'amendment', 'right', 'violate', 'ask', 'judge', 'allow', 'carry', 'sign', 'wear', 'wristband', 'feature', 'xx', 'school', 'event', 'case', 'ongoing', 'district', 'court', 'judge', 'steven', 'mcauliffe', 'president', 'george', 'bush', 'appointee', 'ultimately', 'side', 'school', 'district', 'say', 'act', 'reasonably', 'prevent', 'parent', 'protest', 'plaintiff', 'intend', 'communicate', 'demeaning', 'harass', 'message', 'direct', 'parker', 'tirrell', 'transgender', 'student', 'symbol', 'poster', 'display', 'fully', 'capable', 'convey', 'message', 'write', 'broad', 'message', 'school', 'authority', 'reasonably', 'understand', 'appropriately', 'try', 'prevent', 'broad', 'demeaning', 'harass', 'message', 'school', 'district', 'understand', 'plaintiff', 'xx', 'symbol', 'convey', 'context', 'entirely', 'reasonable', 'continue', 'senior', 'attorney', 'institute', 'free', 'speech', 'attorney', 'represent', 'parent', 'say', 'disagree', 'court', 'decision', 'adult', 'speech', 'limited', 'public', 'forum', 'enjoy', 'great', 'amendment', 'protection', 'student', 'speech', 'classroom', 'attorney', 'del', 'kolde', 'say', 'statement', 'bow', 'school', 'district', 'official', 'obviously', 'discriminate', 'base', 'viewpoint', 'perceive', 'xx', 'wristband', 'trans', 'exclusionary', 'plaintiff', 'file', 'notice', 'follow', 'ruling', 'say', 'plan', 'enter', 'evidence', 'judge', 'issue', 'final', 'decision', 'accord', 'report', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'notably', 'sign', 'executive', 'order', 'keep', 'man', 'woman', 'sport', 'seek', 'protect', 'female', 'student', 'athlete', 'have', 'compete', 'have', 'appear', 'unclothed', 'male', 'order', 'mandate', 'federal', 'department', 'review', 'grant', 'education', 'program', 'appropriate', 'rescind', 'funding', 'program', 'fail', 'comply', 'policy', 'establish', 'order', 'protect', 'woman', 'matter', 'safety', 'fairness', 'dignity', 'truth']",

maine’s democrat house majority voted on thursday to pass a bill that would codify the maine human rights act (mhra) in the state’s constitution. the proposed bill, ld 260, passed with a slim majority and will ultimately need two-thirds majority in both chambers before it can go before voters, fox news reported. 

state officials have cited the mhra in their ongoing dispute with the trump administration over its allowance of males in female sports and spaces. mhra is the state’s anti-discrimination law, and lawmakers added “gender identity” protections in 2021. 

“our position is that title ix, consistent with the maine human rights act, so both federal and state law, supports that trans girls will be able to participate in high school sports consistent with their gender identity,” maine attorney general aaron frey said in a recent cnn interview. “so my contention is maine is following title ix, maine is following the maine human rights act.”  

at the same time, maine republicans are working to strip “gender identity” from the law.

the state house voted on the legislation one day after the u.s. department of justice (doj) filed a lawsuit against maine for its refusal to comply with president trump’s executive order “keeping men out of women’s sports,” which interprets title ix to prohibit the inclusion of males in female sports.

the doj’s complaint accuses maine of “openly and defiantly flouting federal anti-discrimination law.”

“by prioritizing gender identity over biological reality, maine’s policies deprive girl athletes of fair competition, deny them equal athletic opportunities, and expose them to heightened risks of physical injury and physiological harm,” the complaint reads.

president trump’s executive order was created to protect female student athletes from having “to compete with or against or having to appear unclothed before males.” the order also mandates each federal department to “review grants to education programs and, where appropriate, rescind funding to programs that fail to comply with the policy established in this order,” which protects women “as a matter of safety, fairness, dignity, and truth.”

following trump’s order, maine officials publicly said they would not comply, siding with transgender-identifying males over women and girls and citing state law allowing students to play on teams that match their “gender identity.”

then a transgender-identifying boy claimed the victory in the maine class b championship for the greely high school girls’ track and field team in february.

president trump and gov. janet mills had a public spat on february 20, during which he said at the republican governor’s association dinner that maine is at risk of losing federal funding if the state continues to allow males to play on female sports teams.

“we are the federal law. you better do it, because you’re not gonna get any federal funding if you don’t… your population also doesn’t want men in women’s sports,” trump said. “you better comply, or you’re not getting any federal funding.”

“see you in court,” mills replied.

“good. see you in court, that should be a real easy one,” trump fired back. “enjoy your life after, governor. i don’t think you’ll be in elected office.”

both the department of education and department of health and human services subsequently launched investigations into the state and ultimately found the maine department of education and other entities in violation of title ix.

the department of education recently began the process of cutting federal k-12 funding to maine over the transgender debate. the usda also began freezing funding to the state, but a federal court ultimately blocked the move.","['maine', 'democrat', 'want', 'amend', 'state', 'constitution', 'permanently', 'allow', 'transgender', 'identify', 'male', 'compete', 'female', 'sport', 'maine', 'democrat', 'house', 'majority', 'vote', 'thursday', 'pass', 'bill', 'codify', 'maine', 'human', 'right', 'act', 'mhra', 'state', 'constitution', 'propose', 'bill', 'ld', 'pass', 'slim', 'majority', 'ultimately', 'need', 'third', 'majority', 'chamber', 'voter', 'fox', 'news', 'report', 'state', 'official', 'cite', 'mhra', 'ongoing', 'dispute', 'trump', 'administration', 'allowance', 'male', 'female', 'sport', 'space', 'mhra', 'state', 'anti', 'discrimination', 'law', 'lawmaker', 'add', 'gender', 'identity', 'protection', 'position', 'title', 'ix', 'consistent', 'maine', 'human', 'right', 'act', 'federal', 'state', 'law', 'support', 'trans', 'girl', 'able', 'participate', 'high', 'school', 'sport', 'consistent', 'gender', 'identity', 'maine', 'attorney', 'general', 'aaron', 'frey', 'say', 'recent', 'cnn', 'interview', 'contention', 'maine', 'follow', 'title', 'ix', 'maine', 'follow', 'maine', 'human', 'right', 'act', 'time', 'maine', 'republicans', 'work', 'strip', 'gender', 'identity', 'law', 'state', 'house', 'vote', 'legislation', 'day', 'department', 'justice', 'doj', 'file', 'lawsuit', 'maine', 'refusal', 'comply', 'president', 'trump', 'executive', 'order', 'keep', 'man', 'woman', 'sport', 'interpret', 'title', 'ix', 'prohibit', 'inclusion', 'male', 'female', 'sport', 'doj', 'complaint', 'accuse', 'maine', 'openly', 'defiantly', 'flout', 'federal', 'anti', 'discrimination', 'law', 'prioritize', 'gender', 'identity', 'biological', 'reality', 'maine', 'policy', 'deprive', 'girl', 'athlete', 'fair', 'competition', 'deny', 'equal', 'athletic', 'opportunity', 'expose', 'heighten', 'risk', 'physical', 'injury', 'physiological', 'harm', 'complaint', 'read', 'related', 'boy', 'win', 'high', 'school', 'girl', 'pole', 'vault', 'competition', 'maine', 'state', 'pledge', 'flout', 'trump', 'order', 'president', 'trump', 'executive', 'order', 'create', 'protect', 'female', 'student', 'athlete', 'have', 'compete', 'have', 'appear', 'unclothed', 'male', 'order', 'mandate', 'federal', 'department', 'review', 'grant', 'education', 'program', 'appropriate', 'rescind', 'funding', 'program', 'fail', 'comply', 'policy', 'establish', 'order', 'protect', 'woman', 'matter', 'safety', 'fairness', 'dignity', 'truth', 'follow', 'trump', 'order', 'maine', 'official', 'publicly', 'say', 'comply', 'side', 'transgender', 'identify', 'male', 'woman', 'girl', 'cite', 'state', 'law', 'allow', 'student', 'play', 'team', 'match', 'gender', 'identity', 'transgender', 'identify', 'boy', 'claim', 'victory', 'maine', 'class', 'b', 'championship', 'greely', 'high', 'school', 'girl', 'track', 'field', 'team', 'february', 'president', 'trump', 'gov', 'janet', 'mill', 'public', 'spat', 'february', 'say', 'republican', 'governor', 'association', 'dinner', 'maine', 'risk', 'lose', 'federal', 'funding', 'state', 'continue', 'allow', 'male', 'play', 'female', 'sport', 'team', 'federal', 'law', 'well', 'go', 'to', 'federal', 'funding', 'population', 'want', 'man', 'woman', 'sport', 'trump', 'say', 'well', 'comply', 'get', 'federal', 'funding', 'court', 'mill', 'reply', 'good', 'court', 'real', 'easy', 'trump', 'fire', 'enjoy', 'life', 'governor', 'think', 'elect', 'office', 'department', 'education', 'department', 'health', 'human', 'service', 'subsequently', 'launch', 'investigation', 'state', 'ultimately', 'find', 'maine', 'department', 'education', 'entity', 'violation', 'title', 'ix', 'department', 'education', 'recently', 'begin', 'process', 'cut', 'federal', 'fund', 'maine', 'transgender', 'debate', 'usda', 'begin', 'freeze', 'funding', 'state', 'federal', 'court', 'ultimately', 'block']",

he added, “i think, and going back to what i had been talking about earlier about how we cannot lose our humanity in these discussions, i think that every student deserves to have an equal opportunity to participate, i think that every student deserves to be uplifted. and so, i think our conversation should be making sure that we’re not looking at people as necessarily boy, girl, right? or trans girl, trans boy. i really think this conversation about what the law says and how we need to make sure we are fulfilling the promise of the law, i think that means, for trans students, under title ix and the maine human rights act, it means we should just be talking about — even that one student — making sure that they have access to participate in the sport of their identified gender.”","['portion', 'interview', 'portland', 'maine', 'abc', 'affiliate', 'channel', 'wmtw', 'release', 'thursday', 'attorney', 'general', 'aaron', 'frey', 'd', 'discuss', 'legal', 'battle', 'state', 'federal', 'government', 'allow', 'biological', 'man', 'compete', 'woman', 'sport', 'argue', 'think', 'conversation', 'make', 'sure', 'look', 'people', 'necessarily', 'boy', 'girl', 'right', 'trans', 'girl', 'tran', 'boy', 'response', 'question', 'state', 'keep', 'tab', 'transgender', 'athlete', 'woman', 'sport', 'frey', 'say', 'discriminate', 'term', 'set', 'record', 'try', 'target', 'individual', 'identifiable', 'status', 'get', 'information', 'source', 'result', 'lawsuit', 'add', 'think', 'go', 'talk', 'early', 'lose', 'humanity', 'discussion', 'think', 'student', 'deserve', 'equal', 'opportunity', 'participate', 'think', 'student', 'deserve', 'uplifted', 'think', 'conversation', 'make', 'sure', 'look', 'people', 'necessarily', 'boy', 'girl', 'right', 'trans', 'girl', 'trans', 'boy', 'think', 'conversation', 'law', 'say', 'need', 'sure', 'fulfil', 'promise', 'law', 'think', 'mean', 'trans', 'student', 'title', 'ix', 'maine', 'human', 'right', 'act', 'mean', 'talk', 'student', 'make', 'sure', 'access', 'participate', 'sport', 'identify', 'gender']",

“we must help protect the civil rights of our trans friends and family,” dunham declared at the first “transgender day of visibility” in washington, d.c. during president donald trump’s second term in office.

dunham went on to talk about the importance of standing strong “in the face of such hatred and misunderstanding,” amid what she believes to be “dangers and traumas trans people face today, and the hard truths about how trans people are valued by the current leadership of this country.”

“when my sibling came out as trans, i learned that i had never actually had a sister at all, but a wise, funny, resilient, powerful, remarkable brother,” the once upon a time in hollywood star continued.

“the experience of going through my brother’s transition has been a profound gift to our family,” dunham declared. “we have laughed, we have cried, we have learned, and re-learned.”

the scandal actress added, “i have seen my parents grow into a new understanding of their child, and i re-met my sibling as the truest version of himself — the person that he already was as a child before society sent him so many signals about what conformity meant, and he had to shut away these beautiful and essential aspects of who he is.”

dunham also railed against “the horrific abuses that the government is attempting to commit and the rights they’re attempting to take away and already in the process of doing.”

“trans liberation is our liberation. and without it, none of us are free,” dunham asserted.

dunham has stayed largely out of the limelight of late, save for a few public appearances since 2023. that year, she joined hollywood director judd apatow and transgender activists in going after the new york times over its coverage of transgender children. they honed in on an article that exposed school administrators who encourage minors to change their gender behind their parents’ backs.

dunham, of course, was a spokeswoman for the clinton campaign in 2016. she hit the stump for the democratic candidate in iowa and new hampshire, spoke in primetime at the democratic national committee, and headlined rallies for clinton just months before her loss to donald trump.","['hbo', 'girl', 'creator', 'american', 'horror', 'story', 'star', 'longtime', 'breitbart', 'fan', 'girl', 'lena', 'dunham', 'rail', 'horrific', 'government', 'abuse', 'trans', 'visibility', 'rally', 'monday', 'trans', 'liberation', 'liberation', 'actress', 'proclaim', 'help', 'protect', 'civil', 'right', 'trans', 'friend', 'family', 'dunham', 'declare', 'transgender', 'day', 'visibility', 'washington', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'second', 'term', 'office', 'dunham', 'go', 'talk', 'importance', 'stand', 'strong', 'face', 'hatred', 'misunderstanding', 'amid', 'believe', 'danger', 'trauma', 'trans', 'people', 'face', 'today', 'hard', 'truth', 'trans', 'people', 'value', 'current', 'leadership', 'country', 'sibling', 'come', 'trans', 'learn', 'actually', 'sister', 'wise', 'funny', 'resilient', 'powerful', 'remarkable', 'brother', 'time', 'hollywood', 'star', 'continue', 'experience', 'go', 'brother', 'transition', 'profound', 'gift', 'family', 'dunham', 'declare', 'laugh', 'cry', 'learn', 'learn', 'scandal', 'actress', 'add', 'see', 'parent', 'grow', 'new', 'understanding', 'child', 'meet', 'sibling', 'true', 'version', 'person', 'child', 'society', 'send', 'signal', 'conformity', 'meant', 'shut', 'away', 'beautiful', 'essential', 'aspect', 'dunham', 'rail', 'horrific', 'abuse', 'government', 'attempt', 'commit', 'right', 'attempt', 'away', 'process', 'trans', 'liberation', 'liberation', 'free', 'dunham', 'assert', 'dunham', 'stay', 'largely', 'limelight', 'late', 'save', 'public', 'appearance', 'year', 'join', 'hollywood', 'director', 'judd', 'apatow', 'transgender', 'activist', 'go', 'new', 'york', 'times', 'coverage', 'transgender', 'child', 'hone', 'article', 'expose', 'school', 'administrator', 'encourage', 'minor', 'change', 'gender', 'parent', 'back', 'dunham', 'course', 'spokeswoman', 'clinton', 'campaign', 'hit', 'stump', 'democratic', 'candidate', 'iowa', 'new', 'hampshire', 'speak', 'primetime', 'democratic', 'national', 'committee', 'headline', 'rally', 'clinton', 'month', 'loss', 'donald', 'trump']",

“just got off the phone with @realdonaldtrump,” mace said on wednesday, the day after the reported assault.

“thank you, mr. president, for checking in on me and for standing up for women,” she continued. “we cannot wait to see you back in the white house. #holdtheline.”

trump’s call to mace came after she revealed on x that she was “physically accosted at the capitol tonight by a pro-tr*ns man.”

“one new brace for my wrist and some ice for my arm and it’ll heal just fine. the capitol police arrested the guy. your tr*ns violence and threats on my life will only make me double down. fafo,” she said, using her frequently used mantra, “hold the line.”

u.s. capitol police confirmed the incident.

“tonight, the united states capitol police (uscp) arrested a person who is accused of assaulting a u.s. representative,” a capitol police spokesperson said.

“just before 6:00 p.m., the member of congress’ office reported an incident in the rayburn house office building. house division officers, and agents with the threat assessment section, tracked down the suspect,” the spokesperson continued, confirming that the suspect — identified as 33-year-old james mcintyre of illinois — has been arrested.

“mcintyre is facing a charge for assaulting a government official,” the spokesperson added.

mace has continued to face a wave of hate from the radical left over her insistence that biological men should not use single-sex spaces designated for women, pushing a measure to ensure that only women are using women’s facilities in the u.s. capitol. that comes as transgender delaware rep.-elect sarah mcbride (d) — a man who believes he is a woman — is joining the house of representatives in january.

“i’m not going to allow biological men into women’s private spaces,” mace said, defending her position.”i will stand in the brink and stand in the way of anyone on the radical left who thinks that it’s ok for a penis to be in a women’s locker room or a bathroom or a changing room. hell no, i’m not going to stand for it.”

during that interview, which occurred prior to tuesday’s incident, mace said she had received death threats over her common sense position.

“why is it that these crazy people, the insanity, the radical left are willing to kill women over a man’s right to be in a women’s restroom?” she asked.

“forcing women to share private spaces with men is not dignity and not respect,” she continued. “i’m absolutely going to stand in the way of anyone who thinks it’s ok for a man to be in our locker room and our changing rooms, in our dressing rooms and women’s bathrooms.”

she later doubled down with the stop the invasion of women’s spaces act, which would block biological men from using single-sex spaces for women — restrooms, locker rooms, and changing rooms — at all federally-funded facilities.

“never want to hear the left call themselves the party of love and tolerance ever again,” mace said on x on wednesday following the incident.
“the left is the party of violence against women,” she continued, casting doubt that she would hear a condemnation of the violence from those who oppose her position, such as rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez (d-ny), who bizarrely asserted that preventing biological men from using women’s facilities endangers women.","['president', 'elect', 'donald', 'trump', 'check', 'rep', 'nancy', 'mace', 'r', 'sc', 'transgender', 'activist', 'allegedly', 'assault', 'congresswoman', 'leave', 'wrist', 'brace', 'get', 'phone', 'mace', 'say', 'wednesday', 'day', 'report', 'assault', 'thank', 'mr', 'president', 'check', 'stand', 'woman', 'continue', 'wait', 'white', 'house', 'holdtheline', 'trump', 'mace', 'come', 'reveal', 'x', 'physically', 'accost', 'capitol', 'tonight', 'pro', 'man', 'new', 'brace', 'wrist', 'ice', 'arm', 'heal', 'fine', 'capitol', 'police', 'arrest', 'guy', 'violence', 'threat', 'life', 'double', 'fafo', 'say', 'frequently', 'mantra', 'hold', 'line', 'capitol', 'police', 'confirm', 'incident', 'tonight', 'united', 'states', 'capitol', 'police', 'uscp', 'arrest', 'person', 'accuse', 'assault', 'representative', 'capitol', 'police', 'spokesperson', 'say', 'member', 'congress', 'office', 'report', 'incident', 'rayburn', 'house', 'office', 'building', 'house', 'division', 'officer', 'agent', 'threat', 'assessment', 'section', 'track', 'suspect', 'spokesperson', 'continue', 'confirm', 'suspect', 'identify', 'year', 'old', 'james', 'mcintyre', 'illinois', 'arrest', 'mcintyre', 'face', 'charge', 'assault', 'government', 'official', 'spokesperson', 'add', 'mace', 'continue', 'face', 'wave', 'hate', 'radical', 'left', 'insistence', 'biological', 'man', 'use', 'single', 'sex', 'space', 'designate', 'woman', 'push', 'measure', 'ensure', 'woman', 'woman', 'facility', 'capitol', 'come', 'transgender', 'delaware', 'sarah', 'mcbride', 'd', 'man', 'believe', 'woman', 'join', 'house', 'representative', 'january', 'go', 'allow', 'biological', 'man', 'woman', 'private', 'space', 'mace', 'say', 'defend', 'position', 'stand', 'brink', 'stand', 'way', 'radical', 'left', 'think', 'ok', 'penis', 'woman', 'locker', 'room', 'bathroom', 'change', 'room', 'hell', 'go', 'stand', 'interview', 'occur', 'prior', 'tuesday', 'incident', 'mace', 'say', 'receive', 'death', 'threat', 'common', 'sense', 'position', 'crazy', 'people', 'insanity', 'radical', 'left', 'willing', 'kill', 'woman', 'man', 'right', 'woman', 'restroom', 'ask', 'force', 'woman', 'share', 'private', 'space', 'man', 'dignity', 'respect', 'continue', 'absolutely', 'go', 'stand', 'way', 'think', 'ok', 'man', 'locker', 'room', 'change', 'room', 'dress', 'room', 'woman', 'bathroom', 'later', 'double', 'stop', 'invasion', 'woman', 'spaces', 'act', 'block', 'biological', 'man', 'single', 'sex', 'space', 'woman', 'restroom', 'locker', 'room', 'change', 'room', 'federally', 'fund', 'facility', 'want', 'hear', 'left', 'party', 'love', 'tolerance', 'mace', 'say', 'x', 'wednesday', 'follow', 'incident', 'left', 'party', 'violence', 'woman', 'continue', 'cast', 'doubt', 'hear', 'condemnation', 'violence', 'oppose', 'position', 'rep', 'alexandria', 'ocasio', 'cortez', 'd', 'ny', 'bizarrely', 'assert', 'prevent', 'biological', 'man', 'woman', 'facility', 'endanger', 'woman']",

“my staff has arrived to another wonderful morning in washington, dc,” mace said in part on monday morning, sharing an image of a sticker left behind on her plaque. it reads, “a trans person peed here. you survived”:

mace has continued to receive hate from the left for proposing a measure that would prevent biological men from using women’s restrooms at the u.s. capitol. that moves comes as delaware rep.-elect sarah mcbride (d) — a man who believes he is a woman — is set to join the house of representatives in january. the simple bill states that a “member, delegate, resident commissioner, officer, or employee of the house may not use a single-sex facility (including a restroom, changing room, or locker room) in the capitol or house office buildings, other than those corresponding to the biological sex of such individual”:

she has continued to defend her position from the likes of rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez (d-ny), who bizarrely asserted that preventing biological men from using spaces designated for women endangers women.

“what nancy mace and what speaker johnson are doing are endangering all women and girls,” she began. “because if you ask them, ‘what is your plan on how to enforce this?’ they won’t come up with an answer.”

the democrat then outlined an incredibly weird scenario, which would have men checking women’s private parts to ensure they are truly women before entering.

“and what it inevitably results in are women and girls who are primed for assault because they want — because people are going to want to check their private parts in suspecting who is trans and who is this, and who’s doing what,” she asserted.

“people have a right to express themselves, to dress how they want and to be who they are, and if a woman doesn’t look woman enough to a republican, they want to be able to inspect her genitals to use a bathroom,” ocasio-cortez claimed. “it’s disgusting.”

that kind of logic has been embraced by other activists, too, as one of them told a member of mace’s staff that sex-based bathrooms are bad because people who have cancer lose hair:

“i’m not going to allow biological men into women’s private spaces,” mace said to the critics. i will stand in the brink and stand in the way of anyone on the radical left who thinks that it’s ok for a penis to be in a women’s locker room or a bathroom or a changing room. hell no, i’m not going to stand for it.”

“forcing women to share private spaces with men is not dignity and not respect,” mace later added. “i’m absolutely going to stand in the way of anyone who thinks it’s ok for a man to be in our locker room and our changing rooms, in our dressing rooms and women’s bathrooms.”

mace has since taken her position a step further and proposed the stop the invasion of women’s spaces act, which would block biological men from using women’s spaces — such as restrooms, locker rooms, and changing rooms — at all federally funded facilities:","['transgender', 'activist', 'obsess', 'attack', 'rep', 'nancy', 'mace', 'r', 'sc', 'effort', 'biological', 'man', 'woman', 'restroom', 'staff', 'arrive', 'wonderful', 'morning', 'washington', 'dc', 'mace', 'say', 'monday', 'morning', 'share', 'image', 'sticker', 'leave', 'plaque', 'read', 'trans', 'person', 'pee', 'survive', 'mace', 'continue', 'receive', 'hate', 'left', 'propose', 'measure', 'prevent', 'biological', 'man', 'woman', 'restroom', 'capitol', 'move', 'come', 'delaware', 'sarah', 'mcbride', 'd', 'man', 'believe', 'woman', 'set', 'join', 'house', 'representative', 'january', 'simple', 'bill', 'state', 'member', 'delegate', 'resident', 'commissioner', 'officer', 'employee', 'house', 'use', 'single', 'sex', 'facility', 'include', 'restroom', 'change', 'room', 'locker', 'room', 'capitol', 'house', 'office', 'building', 'correspond', 'biological', 'sex', 'individual', 'continue', 'defend', 'position', 'like', 'rep', 'alexandria', 'ocasio', 'cortez', 'd', 'ny', 'bizarrely', 'assert', 'prevent', 'biological', 'man', 'space', 'designate', 'woman', 'endanger', 'woman', 'nancy', 'mace', 'speaker', 'johnson', 'endanger', 'woman', 'girl', 'begin', 'ask', 'plan', 'enforce', 'will', 'come', 'answer', 'democrat', 'outline', 'incredibly', 'weird', 'scenario', 'man', 'check', 'woman', 'private', 'part', 'ensure', 'truly', 'woman', 'enter', 'inevitably', 'result', 'woman', 'girl', 'prime', 'assault', 'want', 'people', 'go', 'want', 'check', 'private', 'part', 'suspecting', 'trans', 'assert', 'people', 'right', 'express', 'dress', 'want', 'woman', 'look', 'woman', 'republican', 'want', 'able', 'inspect', 'genital', 'use', 'bathroom', 'ocasio', 'cortez', 'claim', 'disgust', 'kind', 'logic', 'embrace', 'activist', 'tell', 'member', 'mace', 'staff', 'sex', 'base', 'bathroom', 'bad', 'people', 'cancer', 'lose', 'hair', 'go', 'allow', 'biological', 'man', 'woman', 'private', 'space', 'mace', 'say', 'critic', 'stand', 'brink', 'stand', 'way', 'radical', 'left', 'think', 'ok', 'penis', 'woman', 'locker', 'room', 'bathroom', 'change', 'room', 'hell', 'go', 'stand', 'force', 'woman', 'share', 'private', 'space', 'man', 'dignity', 'respect', 'mace', 'later', 'add', 'absolutely', 'go', 'stand', 'way', 'think', 'ok', 'man', 'locker', 'room', 'change', 'room', 'dress', 'room', 'woman', 'bathroom', 'mace', 'take', 'position', 'step', 'propose', 'stop', 'invasion', 'woman', 'spaces', 'act', 'block', 'biological', 'man', 'woman', 'space', 'restroom', 'locker', 'room', 'change', 'room', 'federally', 'fund', 'facility']",

president-elect trump has vowed to reverse course on the biden administration’s embrace of gender ideology and has promised to protect women’s sports and spaces, and to protect children from mutilating sex-change drugs and procedures. many of his cabinet selections have a history of supporting the biological reality of two sexes, and with control of the house and senate, republicans have expressed plans to do the same.

zoei montgomery, 25, a man who believes he is a woman, told the outlet he has been stockpiling transgender drugs since september and also has an emergency plan to leave his home in washington state for canada if somehow, he is unable to get ahold of his drugs. his “exit plan…includes a kayak.” it should be noted that most laws regarding sex change drugs and procedures are aimed at protecting children, and do not outright ban procedures for adults. republicans have typically been supportive of blocking taxpayer funding for sex changes. 

“i would hate to leave home,” said montgomery, who works as a school custodian. “but it makes me less anxious to have an exit plan in place.”

other people who identify as lgbtq+ plan to move from conservative states to blue states, and many have already done so under the biden administration, according to the report.

a small nonprofit called the trans continental pipeline told the publication that they have been helping people move to transgender-friendly colorado since last year. while the group said it typically works with around 15 people a month, the group was reportedly contacted by 350 people in the week after the election. 

“they don’t want to leave,” said keira richards, the group’s executive director. “but they just feel like they don’t have a choice.”

jake nichols, a gay 18-year-old from missouri, told the publication he plans to move to california when he graduates high school. he reportedly withdrew his acceptance from a university in missouri since trump won the election.

the trevor project, which actively promotes sex changes for minors, told the publication it saw a nearly 700 percent increase in calls, texts, and chat messages to its crisis center the day after the election, compared to weeks prior.

besides those interviewed by the post, many left-leaning celebrities have left the united states in response to trump’s win, including comedian ellen degeneres and actress eva longoria.

other liberals, distressed by trump’s election victory, have been stockpiling abortion pills, getting sterilized, and even swearing off sex altogether.","['people', 'tell', 'left', 'lean', 'washington', 'post', 'stockpile', 'transgend', 'drug', 'make', 'plan', 'donald', 'trump', 'win', 'presidential', 'election', 'president', 'elect', 'trump', 'vow', 'reverse', 'course', 'biden', 'administration', 'embrace', 'gender', 'ideology', 'promise', 'protect', 'woman', 'sport', 'space', 'protect', 'child', 'mutilate', 'sex', 'change', 'drug', 'procedure', 'cabinet', 'selection', 'history', 'support', 'biological', 'reality', 'sex', 'control', 'house', 'senate', 'republicans', 'express', 'plan', 'zoei', 'montgomery', 'man', 'believe', 'woman', 'tell', 'outlet', 'stockpile', 'transgender', 'drug', 'september', 'emergency', 'plan', 'leave', 'home', 'washington', 'state', 'canada', 'unable', 'ahold', 'drug', 'exit', 'plan', 'include', 'kayak', 'note', 'law', 'sex', 'change', 'drug', 'procedure', 'aim', 'protect', 'child', 'outright', 'ban', 'procedure', 'adult', 'republicans', 'typically', 'supportive', 'block', 'taxpayer', 'funding', 'sex', 'change', 'hate', 'leave', 'home', 'say', 'montgomery', 'work', 'school', 'custodian', 'make', 'anxious', 'exit', 'plan', 'place', 'people', 'identify', 'plan', 'conservative', 'state', 'blue', 'state', 'biden', 'administration', 'accord', 'report', 'small', 'nonprofit', 'call', 'trans', 'continental', 'pipeline', 'tell', 'publication', 'help', 'people', 'transgender', 'friendly', 'colorado', 'year', 'group', 'say', 'typically', 'work', 'people', 'month', 'group', 'reportedly', 'contact', 'people', 'week', 'election', 'want', 'leave', 'say', 'keira', 'richards', 'group', 'executive', 'director', 'feel', 'like', 'choice', 'jake', 'nichols', 'gay', 'year', 'old', 'missouri', 'tell', 'publication', 'plan', 'california', 'graduate', 'high', 'school', 'reportedly', 'withdraw', 'acceptance', 'university', 'missouri', 'trump', 'win', 'election', 'trevor', 'project', 'actively', 'promote', 'sex', 'change', 'minor', 'tell', 'publication', 'see', 'nearly', 'percent', 'increase', 'call', 'text', 'chat', 'message', 'crisis', 'center', 'day', 'election', 'compare', 'week', 'prior', 'interview', 'post', 'left', 'lean', 'celebrity', 'leave', 'united', 'states', 'response', 'trump', 'win', 'include', 'comedian', 'ellen', 'degenere', 'actress', 'eva', 'longoria', 'liberal', 'distress', 'trump', 'election', 'victory', 'stockpile', 'abortion', 'pill', 'getting', 'sterilize', 'swear', 'sex', 'altogether']",

camden schreiner, 21, who uses the name “sadie,” came in first place in the women’s 40o-meter dash open at the usa track and field open masters championships with a time of 56:74, according to the blaze. schreiner won the race after his opponents, anna vidolova, 17, and amaris hiatt, 16, did not compete.

according to the race results, vidolova and hiatt were listed as “did not start,” abbreviated to “dns. ”

schreiner also participated in the women’s 200-meter dash open and won first place against his competitors who were 14, 15, 16, and 18.

according to the blaze, under usatf’s policy, men are allowed “to compete in the women’s category using the justification that they are in compliance with internation olympic committee rules.” transgender athletes are also required to meet “certain medical benchmarks.”

as breitbart news’s warner todd huston reported in december 2023, schreiner, who began using the name “sadie” claimed that they were transgender, and while studying at rochester institute of technology (rit) began “breaking women’s records.”

in february 2025, rit revealed that sadie would not be competing for the school after the national collegiate athletic association (ncaa) banned biological males from competing in women’s sports in response to president donald trump’s executive order, “keeping men out of women’s sports.”

trump’s executive order says that “it is the policy of the united states to rescind all funds from educational programs that deprive women and girls of fair athletic opportunities, which results in the endangerment, humiliation, and silencing of women and girls and deprives them of privacy.”

“it shall also be the policy of the united states to oppose male competitive participation in women’s sports more broadly, as a matter of safety, fairness, dignity, and truth,” the executive order says.","['transgender', 'identify', 'male', 'athlete', 'win', 'meter', 'woman', 'race', 'staten', 'island', 'new', 'york', 'saturday', 'teenage', 'girl', 'opt', 'compete', 'camden', 'schreiner', 'use', 'sadie', 'come', 'place', 'woman', 'meter', 'dash', 'open', 'usa', 'track', 'field', 'open', 'master', 'championship', 'time', 'accord', 'blaze', 'schreiner', 'win', 'race', 'opponent', 'anna', 'vidolova', 'amaris', 'hiatt', 'compete', 'accord', 'race', 'result', 'vidolova', 'hiatt', 'list', 'start', 'abbreviate', 'dns', 'schreiner', 'participate', 'woman', 'meter', 'dash', 'open', 'win', 'place', 'competitor', 'accord', 'blaze', 'usatf', 'policy', 'man', 'allow', 'compete', 'woman', 'category', 'justification', 'compliance', 'internation', 'olympic', 'committee', 'rule', 'transgender', 'athlete', 'require', 'meet', 'certain', 'medical', 'benchmark', 'breitbart', 'news', 'warner', 'todd', 'huston', 'report', 'december', 'schreiner', 'begin', 'sadie', 'claim', 'transgender', 'study', 'rochester', 'institute', 'technology', 'rit', 'begin', 'break', 'woman', 'record', 'february', 'rit', 'reveal', 'sadie', 'compete', 'school', 'national', 'collegiate', 'athletic', 'association', 'ncaa', 'ban', 'biological', 'male', 'compete', 'woman', 'sport', 'response', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'executive', 'order', 'keep', 'man', 'woman', 'sport', 'trump', 'executive', 'order', 'say', 'policy', 'united', 'states', 'rescind', 'fund', 'educational', 'program', 'deprive', 'woman', 'girl', 'fair', 'athletic', 'opportunity', 'result', 'endangerment', 'humiliation', 'silence', 'woman', 'girl', 'deprive', 'privacy', 'shall', 'policy', 'united', 'states', 'oppose', 'male', 'competitive', 'participation', 'woman', 'sport', 'broadly', 'matter', 'safety', 'fairness', 'dignity', 'truth', 'executive', 'order', 'say']",
94275481-d401-4a5b-be29-61eefa044a1e,anti,indiana parents ask scotus to weigh in on state taking custody of sex-confused teen,"['indiana', 'parent', 'ask', 'scotus', 'weigh', 'state', 'take', 'custody', 'sex', 'confuse', 'teen']",breitbart,katherine hamilton,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2024/02/19/indiana-parents-ask-scotus-weigh-state-taking-custody-sex-confused-teen/,2/19/2024,"the state of indiana took a teenage boy from his catholic parents after he started identifying as a girl.

now his parents, jeremy and mary cox, have asked the supreme court to weigh in on their child custody case, arguing that the indiana department of child services violated their parental rights and religious liberty when the agency investigated them for refusing to use their son’s “preferred pronouns” and ultimately kept him from their home while he struggled with an eating disorder.

“if this can happen in indiana, it can happen anywhere. tearing a child away from loving parents because of their religious beliefs, which are shared by millions of americans, is an outrage to the law, parental rights, and basic human decency,” said lori windham, vice president and senior counsel for the becket fund for religious liberty. “if the supreme court doesn’t take this case, how many times will this happen to other families?” 

the cox’s son told them of his female identity in 2019, but because of their religious belief that god created human beings with immutable sex, they would not use his “preferred pronouns,” their attorneys said in a press release. the parents also believe he needed help with underlying mental health concerns, including an eating disorder.

“to address both issues, they provided therapeutic care for their child’s gender dysphoria and scheduled appointments with a specialist to help him with the eating disorder,” attorneys said.

however, the state began investigating the parents in 2021 after a report that they were refusing to use their son’s preferred pronouns or acknowledge him as a girl. the state then removed him from the parents’ home and placed him in a home that affirmed his transgender identity. 

“at the initial trial court hearing, indiana officials argued the child ‘should be in a home where she is [ac]cepted for who she is.’ the court restricted the coxes’ visitation time to a few hours once a week and barred them from speaking to their child about their religious views on human sexuality and gender identity,” according to the becket fund. 

ultimately, the state ended up abandoning its accusations of abuse but ended up arguing that the parent’s unwillingness to accept his female identity was contributing to his eating disorder. the trial court ended up allowing the state to keep custody of the teen and kept the gag order in place. 

“in short, even though the court agreed that the coxes were fit parents, it upheld the removal of their child. an appeals court upheld the removal,” attorneys said. 

attorneys for the coxes told the supreme court in its reply brief that the case is of “nationwide importance,” and that the state’s “tack — blame a comorbidity and dodge adjudication of parental fitness — provides a playbook that any state can use to eviscerate bedrock constitutional protections while guaranteeing they remain insulated from review.”

“with increasing frequency, governments run roughshod over parents’ religious beliefs on gender identity, including removing children from parents, favoring certain beliefs in divorce custody disputes, and preventing adoptions,” the brief reads. “these cases are sure to proliferate. some state legislatures are now authorizing the state to take custody where parents refuse full-steam-ahead gender transitions.  and by one estimate, ten million students nationwide attend schools that will actively conceal a child’s gender identity from his parents.”

“this case presents a legal question of nationwide importance: when can the state muzzle parental speech and remove a child from the home of admittedly fit parents? the [lower court decision] squarely conflicts with this court’s precedents on parental rights, free speech, and religious exercise,” the brief continues. 

attorneys for the coxes first filed a petition for writ of certiorari to the supreme court in september of 2023. republican attorney general todd rokita, representing the state’s department of child services, filed a brief in opposition in january. 

the state is arguing that the case is moot because the cox’s son is an adult now.

“but if indiana is right, all child welfare cases will become unreviewable when the child turns 18. that is textbook capable-of-repetition-yet-evading-review,” the parents’ attorneys wrote.

the attorney general’s office is also arguing that teen was removed because of his eating disorder. 

“rather, petitioners’ child was removed because the child had a severe eating disorder that petitioners had not been able to effectively address for two years, that jeopardized the child’s brain and bone health,” the attorney general’s office stated. 

the brief additionally argues that the teen’s eating disorder was caused in part by “self-isolation” from his parents that was “likely to reoccur” if he was returned home. 

“this is what every parent is afraid of. we love our son and wanted to care for him, but the state of indiana robbed us of that opportunity by taking him from our home and banning us from speaking to him about gender,” said mary and jeremy cox. “we are hopeful that the justices will take our case and protect other parents from having to endure the nightmare we did.”

the since abandoned marketing campaign, featured the slogan “too many balls.” the slogan was met by intense blowback from the transgender community, including a trans player for the seattle reign named quinn, who responded to the campaign by writing, “feels transphobic. yikes,” on instagram.

in response to the backlash, the team shut down the campaign in october and issued an apology to the trans community.

“we fully acknowledge that the content of the campaign did not reflect the safe and welcoming environment we strive to create for all, and we apologize to the lgbtq+ community and to the trans community in particular for the hurt we caused,” the statement said.

not only did the team drop its marketing campaign, it also decided to move on from its proposed franchise name, bos nation fc.

“the club extends our heartfelt thanks to our supporters, whose passionate voices we deeply value- not just for their unwavering support but also for their honest and critical feedback,” majority owner jennifer epstein said in a statement.

“we could not have completed this process without your input. we aim to build a lasting legacy that makes all our fans feel welcome, connected, and proud to wear our colors and cheer our name for generations to come.”

opposition to trans inclusion in women’s sports has grown steadily to the point that a recent new york times/ipsos poll found that 79% of americans are opposed to allowing males to compete against women. not only that, the poll found that 67% of democrats oppose allowing trans athletes in women’s sports.","['boston', 'base', 'national', 'woman', 'soccer', 'league', 'nwsl', 'team', 'change', 'transgender', 'community', 'react', 'negatively', 'team', 'marketing', 'campaign', 'abandon', 'marketing', 'campaign', 'feature', 'slogan', 'ball', 'slogan', 'meet', 'intense', 'blowback', 'transgender', 'community', 'include', 'trans', 'player', 'seattle', 'reign', 'name', 'quinn', 'respond', 'campaign', 'write', 'feel', 'transphobic', 'yike', 'instagram', 'response', 'backlash', 'team', 'shut', 'campaign', 'october', 'issue', 'apology', 'trans', 'community', 'fully', 'acknowledge', 'content', 'campaign', 'reflect', 'safe', 'welcoming', 'environment', 'strive', 'create', 'apologize', 'community', 'trans', 'community', 'particular', 'hurt', 'cause', 'statement', 'say', 'team', 'drop', 'marketing', 'campaign', 'decide', 'propose', 'franchise', 'bos', 'nation', 'fc', 'club', 'extend', 'heartfelt', 'thank', 'supporter', 'passionate', 'voice', 'deeply', 'unwavering', 'support', 'honest', 'critical', 'feedback', 'majority', 'owner', 'jennifer', 'epstein', 'say', 'statement', 'complete', 'process', 'input', 'aim', 'build', 'lasting', 'legacy', 'make', 'fan', 'feel', 'welcome', 'connect', 'proud', 'wear', 'color', 'cheer', 'generation', 'come', 'opposition', 'trans', 'inclusion', 'woman', 'sport', 'grow', 'steadily', 'point', 'recent', 'new', 'york', 'times', 'ipsos', 'poll', 'find', 'americans', 'oppose', 'allow', 'male', 'compete', 'woman', 'poll', 'find', 'democrats', 'oppose', 'allow', 'trans', 'athlete', 'woman', 'sport']",
e4ad5f94-ceea-48a6-b503-ac40c918e05c,anti,georgia officials accused of using ‘politically motivated’ pro-transgender questioning to decide crucial medicaid contracts,"['georgia', 'official', 'accuse', 'politically', 'motivated', 'pro', 'transgender', 'questioning', 'decide', 'crucial', 'medicaid', 'contract']",breitbart,katherine hamilton,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/01/17/georgia-officials-accused-of-using-politically-motivated-pro-transgender-questioning-to-decide-crucial-medicaid-contracts/,1/17/2025,"georgia officials are facing backlash for including a pro-transgender line of questioning in the procurement process to award a multi-billion dollar medicaid contract — and spurned insurers warn over one million vulnerable georgians could be left in the lurch.

in what the atlanta journal-constitution described in december 2024 as “potentially the biggest shake-up of georgia’s medicaid system since 2006,” georgia’s department of community health granted new contracts to four insurers last year, while shutting out amerigroup and peach state health plan, companies which had both long managed medicaid care for the state.

during procurement, overseen by georgia’s department of administrative services, ten companies bidding for the contract in december 2023 had to answer 65 hypothetical questions, one of which was about how the company would handle the case of “[a] 14-year-old, transgender white female (assigned male sex at birth but identifies as a female) member living in a rural area [who] has been diagnosed with major depressive disorder.”

“[republican georgia gov.] brian kemp, call your office. georgia just decided that 1.7m people will be forced to change their health insurance because ga bureaucrats decided to mix their liberal agenda with a state procurement,” conservative journalist and political commentator jack posobiec said in a post to x, bringing attention to the transgender facet of the story, which was not reported on by local media. “this is actual text of the use of a transgender question to spend tax dollars.” 

the question (linked in ajc’s reporting), obtained from a sentara health care (one of the insurers who was not awarded a contact) complaint protesting the state’s decision and asking the department of administrative services to start the process over reads:

a fourteen (14) year-old, transgender white female (assigned male sex at birth but identifies as a female) member living in a rural area has been diagnosed with major depressive disorder. she has been seeing a therapist in another town but has missed recent outpatient sessions. in addition, she has anorexia nervosa and will additionally require cognitive behavioral therapy (cbt), group therapy, physical exams, labs and other care. she has two younger siblings, and she shares a bedroom with her younger brother. her family lives 40 minutes from her provider and 2 hours from the nearest hospital, in rural southern georgia. describe the supplier’s approach to engaging the member in a course of treatment. include in the supplier’s response how the supplier may coordinate both the use of telehealth and in-person appointments to deliver care and ensure care continuity.

“soooo ga bureaucrats decided to base potential life saving healthcare decisions for 1.7 million people on one dysphoric person? did i get that right, brian kemp?” former ncaa swimming champion and women’s sports activist riley gaines reacted. 

“the woke mind virus is alive and well…in georgia,” chair of students for trump ryan fournier responded. “what’s with this absurd transgender test the state of georgia is using to spend tax dollars? the brian kemp team is asleep at the wheel.”

breitbart news reached out to gov. kemp’s office for comment about the transgender-related question in procurement. kemp spokesperson garrison douglas said “the governor does not play a role in the state’s medicaid procurement process.”

“that said, after signing numerous pieces of legislation effectively banning boys from playing in girls’ sports, outlawing medical procedures that permanently mutilate the bodies of our children, and prohibiting indoctrination in our classrooms, the facts and governor kemp’s record on this issue is clear and unwavering,” douglas added. 

it should be noted that in 2022, the aclu settled a lawsuit with the georgia department of community health over its exclusion of so-called “gender-affirming surgery” in the state’s medicaid program. according to the aclu of georgia, part of the settlement included the department of community health removing its exclusion for transgender surgeries from georgia medicaid and including benefits and clinical guidelines for gender dysphoria treatment.

another rejected insurer, peach state, who has held a portion of the state’s medicaid contract since 2006 under the parent company centene, said in its 48-page complaint (also linked in ajc’s coverage) that while questions around hypothetical scenarios are not uncommon in the process, “at least one evaluation question appears politically motivated and designed to draw responses to ‘test’ the supplier’s progressive leanings.” the insurer was specifically referring to the transgender-related question.

“it is not uncommon for evaluation questions in a medicaid managed care procurement to include hypothetical scenarios to which the proposer is asked to respond. but the number of extreme scenarios presented in this procurement is atypical from national norms and suggests an underlying agenda that has no place in a competitive procurement for taxpayer-funded healthcare services,” the complaint reads. 

breitbart news reached out to the georgia department of community health and the georgia department of administrative services for an explanation but did not receive a response by time of publication. at least two state evaluators allegedly involved in the process and listed in rejected insurers complaints appear to have donated to actblue, per federal election commission (fec) filings.

in its legal filing, peach state said it currently covers more than 700,000 georgians and alleged that its ousting would “upend the way vulnerable georgians receive their healthcare.”

 “georgia has never experienced a disruption of this magnitude,” the complaint alleges, further warning that a change would force 1.17 million georgia medicaid recipients to change health care providers and leave others with gaps in coverage. 

“the georgians who rely on these important programs for their healthcare, and the taxpayers who pay for these programs, deserve better,” the filing reads. 

in contrast, the successful bidders — caresource, humana employers health plan of georgia, molina health care and united health care of georgia — say they will implement a streamlined system to provide health coverage to poor children and adults, including disabled people, and elderly people in nursing homes, ajc reported.

currently, georgia pays three insurance firms more than $4 billion a year to run the federal-state health programs, according to ajc.

“peach state health plan manages care for roughly 45 percent of georgia’s medicaid patients; amerigroup covers 30 percent; and caresource oversees about 25 percent,” the report states. “amerigroup also handles the smaller contract for georgia families 360, which covers health care for about 33,000 foster care children and young adults.”

the bidding war began in september of 2023, when the state’s health agency sought proposals to manage georgia families, a program “which covers georgia medicaid and peachcare recipients, and georgia families 360, which covers children, teens and young adults in foster care,” according to the report. the state also said it plans to move approximately 200,000 elderly, blind, and disabled people into managed care agreements under the new contracts.

“much is on the line. georgia expects to spend about $4.5 billion on medicaid and peachcare, the program for uninsured kids, in the next year. the medicaid program is administered jointly by federal and state governments, so the feds chip in billions of dollars more,” according to the report.

renu gupta, an office manager for one of south georgia’s largest psychiatric practices, told the outlet she is one of several health care providers who opposes the overhaul.

“it’s not easy to deal with insurance companies, and i’m worried it’s going to be a terrible transition,” gupta said. “it’s not fair for the doctors or their practices. and, i’m telling you, these patients are going to suffer for it.”","['georgia', 'official', 'face', 'backlash', 'include', 'pro', 'transgender', 'line', 'question', 'procurement', 'process', 'award', 'multi', 'billion',

“the #usarmy will no longer allow transgender individuals to join the military and will stop performing or facilitating procedures associated with gender transition for service members,” the u.s. army wrote in a post on x.

the announcement from the u.s. army comes after president donald trump previously signed an executive order stating that people who “express a false ‘gender identity’ divergent from an individual’s sex cannot satisfy the rigorous standards necessary for military service.”

consistent with the military mission and longstanding dod policy, expressing a false “gender identity” divergent from an individual’s sex cannot satisfy the rigorous standards necessary for military service. beyond the hormonal and surgical medical interventions involved, adoption of a gender identity inconsistent with an individual’s sex conflicts with a soldier’s commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one’s personal life. a man’s assertion that he is a woman, and his requirement that others honor this falsehood, is not consistent with the humility and selflessness required of a service member.

the executive order also states that the policy of the u.s. government is to “establish high standards for troop readiness, lethality, cohesion, honesty, humility, uniformity, and integrity,” adding that the policy is “inconsistent with the medical, surgical, and mental health constraints on individuals with gender dysphoria.”

breitbart news’s hannah knudsen previously reported that the pentagon under the trump administration had announced that it was pausing “all new accessions for individuals with a history of gender dysphoria,” and that medical procedures that facilitate and affirm a gender transition were also paused.

a rasmussen reports survey conducted between january 29-30 and february 2, of 1,325 likely voters found that 54 percent of likely voters in the u.s. approve of trump’s executive order to “discharge military service members who identify as transgender.” the survey also found that 41 percent of likely voters in the u.s. “disapprove of discharging transgender service members.”","['united', 'states', 'army', 'announce', 'long', 'allow', 'transgender', 'identify', 'individual', 'join', 'military', 'long', 'perform', 'medical', 'procedure', 'associate', 'gender', 'transition', 'usarmy', 'long', 'allow', 'transgender', 'individual', 'join', 'military', 'stop', 'perform', 'facilitate', 'procedure', 'associate', 'gender', 'transition', 'service', 'member', 'army', 'write', 'post', 'announcement', 'army', 'come', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'previously', 'sign', 'executive', 'order', 'state', 'people', 'express', 'false', 'gender', 'identity', 'divergent', 'individual', 'sex', 'satisfy', 'rigorous', 'standard', 'necessary', 'military', 'service', 'consistent', 'military', 'mission', 'longstanding', 'dod', 'policy', 'express', 'false', 'gender', 'identity', 'divergent', 'individual', 'sex', 'satisfy', 'rigorous', 'standard', 'necessary', 'military', 'service', 'hormonal', 'surgical', 'medical', 'intervention', 'involve', 'adoption', 'gender', 'identity', 'inconsistent', 'individual', 'sex', 'conflict', 'soldier', 'commitment', 'honorable', 'truthful', 'discipline', 'lifestyle', 'personal', 'life', 'man', 'assertion', 'woman', 'requirement', 'honor', 'falsehood', 'consistent', 'humility', 'selflessness', 'require', 'service', 'member', 'executive', 'order', 'state', 'policy', 'government', 'establish', 'high', 'standard', 'troop', 'readiness', 'lethality', 'cohesion', 'honesty', 'humility', 'uniformity', 'integrity', 'add', 'policy', 'inconsistent', 'medical', 'surgical', 'mental', 'health', 'constraint', 'individual', 'gender', 'dysphoria', 'breitbart', 'news', 'hannah', 'knudsen', 'previously', 'report', 'pentagon', 'trump', 'administration', 'announce', 'pause', 'new', 'accession', 'individual', 'history', 'gender', 'dysphoria', 'medical', 'procedure', 'facilitate', 'affirm', 'gender', 'transition', 'pause', 'rasmussen', 'report', 'survey', 'conduct', 'january', 'february', 'likely', 'voter', 'find', 'percent', 'likely', 'voter', 'approve', 'trump', 'executive', 'order', 'discharge', 'military', 'service', 'member', 'identify', 'transgender', 'survey', 'find', 'percent', 'likely', 'voter', 'disapprove', 'discharge', 'transgender', 'service', 'member']",

“i had a bit of a harsh reality check today,” schafer began in a video posted to social media, before noting that president trump had signed an executive order “to declare only two genders recognized by the state, male and female, assigned at birth.”

the term “assigned at birth” is a phrase that left-wing and transgender activists use in place of simply stating “sex” or “biological sex,” as in to imply that the wrong sex was somehow “assigned” to them when they were born.

“as a result of this,” schafer continued. “the bureau of consular affairs has frozen passport applications requesting a gender marker change or renewals or new applications which a gender marker deferring from an applicant’s gender assigned at birth.”

“so my initial reaction to this — because our president is a lot of talk — was like, ‘i’ll believe it when i see it.’ and today, i saw it on my new passport. male,” the actor said, holding his passport up for the camera.

elsewhere in the video, schafer explained, “i went to the federal passport agency today in l.a. — i’ve had to do this one time before, no part of the process was different.”

“i filled everything out, just like i normally would,” the hunger games star added. “i put female, and when it was picked up today — they had changed the marker to male.”

the actor then went on to talk about how “privileged” he is for being “famous,” “white,” and “conventionally” beautiful.

“i want to acknowledge my privilege, like, not only as a, like, famous, like, celebrity trans woman who is white, and thin, and can adhere to, like, contemporary beauty standards, and i can participate in all of that, and i pass — and it still happened,” schafer said.

“i don’t give a fuck that they put an ‘m’ on my passport. it doesn’t change, really, anything about me or my transness,” the cuckoo star continued.

schafer went on to claim that his passport listing him as male makes “life a little harder.”

“it does make life a little harder,” the actor said. “i’ll find out next week when i have to travel abroad for the first time with my new passport.”

“but i’m pretty sure it’s going to come along with having to out myself to, like, border patrol agents and that whole gig much more often than i would like to,” schafer — who is perhaps best known for playing a high school boy posing as a girl in hbo’s euphoria — claimed.

schafer also asserted that “trans people are beautiful. we are never going to stop existing. i’m never going to stop being trans.”

“a letter on a passport can’t change that,” the actor declared, adding, “fuck this administration.”","['hbo', 'euphoria', 'star', 'hunter', 'schafer', 'reveal', 'passport', 'change', 'female', 'male', 'actual', 'biological', 'sex', 'executive', 'order', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'fuck', 'administration', 'trans', 'declare', 'bit', 'harsh', 'reality', 'check', 'today', 'schafer', 'begin', 'video', 'post', 'social', 'medium', 'note', 'president', 'trump', 'sign', 'executive', 'order', 'declare', 'gender', 'recognize', 'state', 'male', 'female', 'assign', 'birth', 'term', 'assign', 'birth', 'phrase', 'left', 'wing', 'transgender', 'activist', 'use', 'place', 'simply', 'state', 'sex', 'biological', 'sex', 'imply', 'wrong', 'sex', 'assign', 'bear', 'result', 'schafer', 'continue', 'bureau', 'consular', 'affair', 'freeze', 'passport', 'application', 'request', 'gender', 'marker', 'change', 'renewal', 'new', 'application', 'gender', 'marker', 'deferring', 'applicant', 'gender', 'assign', 'birth', 'initial', 'reaction', 'president', 'lot', 'talk', 'like', 'believe', 'today', 'see', 'new', 'passport', 'male', 'actor', 'say', 'hold', 'passport', 'camera', 'video', 'schafer', 'explain', 'go', 'federal', 'passport', 'agency', 'today', 'time', 'process', 'different', 'fill', 'like', 'normally', 'hunger', 'games', 'star', 'add', 'female', 'pick', 'today', 'change', 'marker', 'male', 'actor', 'go', 'talk', 'privileged', 'famous', 'white', 'conventionally', 'beautiful', 'want', 'acknowledge', 'privilege', 'like', 'like', 'famous', 'like', 'celebrity', 'trans', 'woman', 'white', 'thin', 'adhere', 'like', 'contemporary', 'beauty', 'standard', 'participate', 'pass', 'happen', 'schafer', 'say', 'fuck', 'm', 'passport', 'change', 'transness', 'cuckoo', 'star', 'continue', 'schafer', 'go', 'claim', 'passport', 'list', 'male', 'make', 'life', 'little', 'hard', 'life', 'little', 'hard', 'actor', 'say', 'find', 'week', 'travel', 'abroad', 'time', 'new', 'passport', 'pretty', 'sure', 'go', 'come', 'have', 'like', 'border', 'patrol', 'agent', 'gig', 'like', 'schafer', 'well', 'know', 'play', 'high', 'school', 'boy', 'pose', 'girl', 'hbo', 'euphoria', 'claim', 'schafer', 'assert', 'trans', 'people', 'beautiful', 'go', 'stop', 'exist', 'go', 'stop', 'tran', 'letter', 'passport', 'change', 'actor', 'declare', 'add', 'fuck', 'administration']",
3a90daeb-9d8c-49c4-a47f-976918c8db30,anti,exclusive: thousands of coloradans urge lawmakers to reject radical transgender bill defining wrong pronouns as child abuse,"['exclusive', 'thousand', 'coloradan', 'urge', 'lawmaker', 'reject', 'radical', 'transgender', 'bill', 'define', 'wrong', 'pronoun', 'child', 'abuse']",breitbart,katherine hamilton,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/04/16/exclusive-thousands-of-coloradans-urge-lawmakers-to-reject-radical-deadnaming-transgender-bill/,4/16/2025,"thousands of coloradans are reaching out to state lawmakers urging them to vote against a radical transgender bill that would classify “misgendering” and “deadnaming” as forms of child abuse that would be considered in child custody disputes.

by tuesday, 6,161 coloradans sent 215,475 emails to colorado state senators through heritage action for america’s colorado action center, breitbart news exclusively learned. heritage action started the colorado action center on april 8 in response to hb25-1312, which passed the state house on april 6 and is currently waiting to be assigned to a senate committee. 

“heritage action and our army of grassroots conservatives in colorado strongly oppose this legislation, which seeks to impose radical gender ideology on families,” heritage action vice president janae stracke told breitbart news in a statement. “this tidal wave of opposition against this legislation in colorado highlights how disconnected radical democrats are from their constituents. this bill is an open assault on parents’ rights and free speech. we urge all colorado lawmakers to reject this legislation.”

the bill subscribes to the false idea that one can identify as or become a different sex than they were born as, often called “gender identity.” the bill defines “deadname” as: “to purposefully, and with the intent to disregard the individual’s gender identity or gender expression, refer to an individual by their birth name rather than their chosen name.” the bill defines “misgender” as: “to purposefully, and with the intent to disregard the individual’s gender identity or gender expression, refer to an individual using an honorific or pronoun that conflicts with the individual’s gender identity or gender expression.”

according to the bill’s summary, the legislation would direct courts making child custody decisions and determining the best interests of a child “for purposes of parenting time” to consider “deadnaming,” “misgendering,” or threatening to publish material related to an individual’s sex change services as types of “coercive control.”

the bill would additionally define “deadnaming” and “misgendering” as discriminatory acts in the “colorado anti-discrimination act,” which would essentially prohibit calling sex-confused individuals by their real names or biological sex in places of public accommodation.

the bill would further prohibit colorado courts from complying with orders or laws from other states mandating that a child be taken from parents or caregivers who allow them access to mutilating sex change drugs and surgeries — which transgender activists euphemistically call “gender-affirming care.”

the legislation would direct schools that establish policies related to “chosen names” to include all reasons why a student may choose to go by a name other than their legal name. schools would also be barred from including rules based on “gender” in dress code policies.

the bill also directs public entities that require individuals to disclose their names to have options for both legal and chosen names. the public entity would be required to use a chosen name on all subsequent forms if it differs from the individual’s legal name.

the bill is officially called the “the kelly loving act,” named after a transgender-identifying man who was killed during the 2022 club q shooting in colorado springs, according to colorado newsline.

democrats hold a trifecta in colorado: they dominate the state house 43-22, the state senate 23-12, and they hold the governorship with gov. jared polis (d).

democrats in the house denied all proposed republican amendments to the bill and were able to use procedural rules to stymie and ultimately halt debate on the bill before passing it on a sunday.

democrats behind the bill have criticized parental rights groups concerned about the transgender bills, with one even comparing them to the ku klux klan. democrat state rep. yara zokaie said, “a well-stakeholded bill does not need to be discussed with hate groups, and we don’t ask someone passing civil rights legislation to go ask the kkk their opinion.”

according to heritage action, “radical gender ideology activists have been working to weaponize child protective services (cps) against us parents by accusing them of ‘abuse’ if they do not affirm and recognize their child’s ‘gender identity.”‘

“multiple states have already passed legislation to criminalize parents through this perverse redefinition of abuse, allowing for the removal of children from the loving homes of ‘non-affirming parents,'” the organization noted.

heritage action says the bill would deny parental rights, violate free speech, harm vulnerable children, and “mandate schools prioritize indoctrination over education.”

“the only time a state should ever remove a child is for actual abuse, not to impose a destructive ideology. the truth is simple. it is never abuse to raise a girl as a girl or a boy as a boy,” the organization says on its colorado action center page.

“it is imperative that all colorado senators hear from their constituents on how this radical bill will tear apart families and harm children across colorado,” the organization added.","['thousand', 'coloradan', 'reach', 'state', 'lawmaker', 'urge', 'vote', 'radical', 'transgender', 'bill', 'classify', 'misgendering', 'deadname', 'form', 'child', 'abuse', 'consider', 'child', 'custody', 'dispute', 'tuesday', 'coloradan', 'send', 'email', 'colorado', 'state', 'senator', 'heritage', 'action', 'america', 'colorado', 'action', 'center', 'breitbart', 'news', 'exclusively', 'learn', 'heritage', 'action', 'start', 'colorado', 'action', 'center', 'april', 'response', 'pass', 'state', 'house', 'april', 'currently', 'wait', 'assign', 'senate', 'committee', 'heritage', 'action', 'army', 'grassroots', 'conservative', 'colorado', 'strongly', 'oppose', 'legislation', 'seek', 'impose', 'radical', 'gender', 'ideology', 'family', 'heritage', 'action', 'vice', 'president', 'janae', 'stracke', 'tell', 'breitbart', 'news', 'statement', 'tidal', 'wave', 'opposition', 'legislation', 'colorado', 'highlight', 'disconnected', 'radical', 'democrat', 'constituent', 'bill', 'open', 'assault', 'parent', 'right', 'free', 'speech', 'urge', 'colorado', 'lawmaker', 'reject', 'legislation', 'bill', 'subscribe', 'false', 'idea', 'identify', 'different', 'sex', 'bear', 'call', 'gender', 'identity', 'bill', 'define', 'deadname', 'purposefully', 'intent', 'disregard', 'individual', 'gender', 'identity', 'gender', 'expression', 'refer', 'individual', 'birth', 'choose', 'bill', 'define', 'misgender', 'purposefully', 'intent', 'disregard', 'individual', 'gender', 'identity', 'gender', 'expression', 'refer', 'individual', 'honorific', 'pronoun', 'conflict', 'individual', 'gender', 'identity', 'gender', 'expression', 'accord', 'bill', 'summary', 'legislation', 'direct', 'court', 'make', 'child', 'custody', 'decision', 'determine', 'good', 'interest', 'child', 'purpose', 'parenting', 'time', 'consider', 'deadname', 'misgendering', 'threaten', 'publish', 'material', 'relate', 'individual', 'sex', 'change', 'service', 'type', 'coercive', 'control', 'bill', 'additionally', 'define', 'deadname', 'misgendering', 'discriminatory', 'act', 'colorado', 'anti', 'discrimination', 'act', 'essentially', 'prohibit', 'call', 'sex', 'confuse', 'individual', 'real', 'name', 'biological', 'sex', 'place', 'public', 'accommodation', 'bill', 'prohibit', 'colorado', 'court', 'comply', 'order', 'law', 'state', 'mandate', 'child', 'take', 'parent', 'caregiver', 'allow', 'access', 'mutilate', 'sex', 'change', 'drug', 'surgery', 'transgender', 'activist', 'euphemistically', 'gender', 'affirm', 'care', 'legislation', 'direct', 'school', 'establish', 'policy', 'relate', 'choose', 'name', 'include', 'reason', 'student', 'choose', 'legal', 'school', 'bar', 'include', 'rule', 'base', 'gender', 'dress', 'code', 'policy', 'bill', 'direct', 'public', 'entity', 'require', 'individual', 'disclose', 'name', 'option', 'legal', 'choose', 'name', 'public', 'entity', 'require', 'use', 'choose', 'subsequent', 'form', 'differ', 'individual', 'legal', 'bill', 'officially', 'call', 'kelly', 'love', 'act', 'name', 'transgender', 'identify', 'man', 'kill', 'club', 'q', 'shooting', 'colorado', 'spring', 'accord', 'colorado', 'newsline', 'democrat', 'hold', 'trifecta', 'colorado', 'dominate', 'state', 'house', 'state', 'senate', 'hold', 'governorship', 'gov', 'jared', 'poli', 'd', 'democrat', 'house', 'deny', 'propose', 'republican', 'amendment', 'bill', 'able', 'use', 'procedural', 'rule', 'stymie', 'ultimately', 'halt', 'debate', 'bill', 'pass', 'sunday', 'democrat', 'bill', 'criticize', 'parental', 'right', 'group', 'concerned', 'transgender', 'bill', 'compare', 'ku', 'klux', 'klan', 'democrat', 'state', 'rep', 'yara', 'zokaie', 'say', 'stakeholde', 'bill', 'need', 'discuss', 'hate', 'group', 'ask', 'pass', 'civil', 'right', 'legislation', 'ask', 'kkk', 'opinion', 'accord', 'heritage', 'action', 'radical', 'gender', 'ideology', 'activist', 'work', 'weaponize', 'child', 'protective', 'service', 'cp', 'parent', 'accuse', 'abuse', 'affirm', 'recognize', 'child', 'gender', 'identity', 'multiple', 'state', 'pass', 'legislation', 'criminalize', 'parent', 'perverse', 'redefinition', 'abuse', 'allow', 'removal', 'child', 'love', 'home', 'non', 'affirming', 'parent', 'organization', 'note', 'heritage', 'action', 'say', 'bill', 'deny', 'parental', 'right', 'violate', 'free', 'speech', 'harm', 'vulnerable', 'child', 'mandate', 'school', 'prioritize', 'indoctrination', 'education', 'time', 'state', 'remove', 'child', 'actual', 'abuse', 'impose', 'destructive', 'ideology', 'truth', 'simple', 'abuse', 'raise', 'girl', 'girl', 'boy', 'boy', 'organization', 'say', 'colorado', 'action', 'center', 'page', 'imperative', 'colorado', 'senator', 'hear', 'constituent', 'radical', 'bill', 'tear', 'apart', 'family', 'harm', 'child', 'colorado', 'organization', 'add']",

california’s gavin newsom opposes trans athletes in women’s sports, splitting with progressivesby bill barrowassociated pressthe associated press

california gov. gavin newsom, a potential 2028 democratic presidential candidate, used the inaugural episode of his new podcast to break from progressives by speaking out against allowing transgender women and girls to compete in female sports.

newsom made his declaration in an extended conversation with conservative activist charlie kirk, the 31-year-old who built the influential turning point usa organization that helped president donald trump increase his support last fall among the youngest generation of voters. kirk, like trump, has been a vocal opponent of allowing transgender women and girls to participate.

“i think it’s an issue of fairness, i completely agree with you on that. it is an issue of fairness — it’s deeply unfair,” newsom told kirk on “this is gavin newsom.”

“i am not wrestling with the fairness issue,” continued newsom, who played varsity baseball as a college student. “i totally agree with you. … i revere sports. so, the issue of fairness is completely legit.”

the governor’s comments are the latest in democrats’ efforts to reconcile a 2024 election that returned trump to the white house and gave republicans control of both chambers of congress. among the disagreements since november is how much cultural issues – as opposed to economic policy and other matters – explain the party’s losses.

overall, polling suggests that allowing transgender female athletes to play on women’s teams isn’t broadly popular. even most democrats — around 7 in 10 — oppose allowing transgender female athletes to participate in women’s sports, according to a january new york times/ipsos poll. a 2023 gallup poll also found that democrats were divided on whether transgender people should be able to play on sports teams that match their current gender identity.

newsom, who has long positioned himself as a social progressive, drew sharp rebukes from lgbtq advocates.

“sometimes gavin newsom goes for the profile in courage, sometimes not,” said california assemblyman chris ward and state sen. carolina menjivar, who lead the state’s lgbtq legislative caucus. “we woke up profoundly sickened and frustrated by these remarks.”

tony hoang, executive director of equality california, said he was “disappointed and angered” by newsom’s statements and that they “added to the heartbreak and fear” the transgender community feels under the trump administration.

“right now, transgender youth, their families, their doctors, and their teachers are facing unprecedented attacks from extremist politicians who want to eviscerate their civil rights and erase them from public life,” hoang said. “they need leaders who will unequivocally fight for them.”

california law, enacted before newsom became governor, requires schools in the state to allow transgender athletes to play on school sports teams consistent with their gender identity.

beyond questions about athletics, there is less public support for broader restrictions on transgender rights and issues like medical care for transgender people, particularly among democrats.

according to ap votecast, 55% of voters in the 2024 election said support for transgender rights in government and society has gone too far, while about 2 in 10 said it’s been about right and a similar share said it hasn’t gone far enough. voters were also slightly more likely to oppose than favor laws that ban gender-affirming medical treatment, such as puberty blockers and hormone therapy, for minors who identify as transgender.

but republicans have nonetheless sought to capitalize on the cultural touchstone that sports represent in america.

trump regularly hammered democratic nominee vice president kamala harris, newsom’s fellow californian, for supporting lgbtq+ rights. trump promised at his rallies to get “transgender insanity the hell out of our schools” and “keep men out of women’s sports.” his campaign also spent tens of millions of dollars on television and digital ads with the searing summation: “kamala is for they/them. president trump is for you.”

“boy, did i see how you guys were able to weaponize it,” newsom told kirk, before yielding to kirk’s protest and saying instead that the ads were an effective “highlight” during the campaign.

since taking office, trump has threatened to withhold federal money from schools that allow transgender athletes to compete in women’s’ or girls’ events. he declared victory on the issue recently when the ncaa, which governs collegiate athletics in the u.s., changed its policy to restrict women’s sporting events to those athletes who were assigned the female gender at birth. previously, the ncaa had a sport-by-sport policy determined by the respective sports’ national or international governing bodies.

ward and menjivar, the california lawmakers, said playing on a team consistent with one’s gender hasn’t been a problem “until donald trump began obsessing about it.”

kirk, not newsom, brought up the overall issue during their hour-plus conversation, which focused in part on how democrats can rebuild a broader coalition of voters. kirk pressed newsom on whether he would speak out in opposition to transgender women athletes in competition.

the governor attempted to mitigate his comments, saying the discussion is about more than competitive advantage.

“there’s also a humility and a grace that these poor people are more likely to commit suicide, have anxiety and depression, and the way that people talk down to vulnerable communities is an issue that i have a hard time with, as well,” newsom said. “so, both things i can hold in my hand. how can we address this issue with the kind of decency that i think is inherent in you but not always expressed on the issue and at the same time deal with the unfairness.”

still, newsom’s approach marks a different political tack than he took on same-sex marriage more than two decades ago. as san francisco mayor in 2004, newsom drew national attention for the first time by directing the city clerk to begin issuing same-sex marriage licenses.

the move prompted legal action that led to a 2008 ruling from the california supreme court legalizing same-sex marriage in the nation’s largest state. that decision came seven years before the u.s. supreme court established same-sex marriage as a national right. —

“an upcoming high school girls’ basketball playoff game will feature an openly transgender athlete playing for san francisco waldorf against cornerstone christian on saturday,” reported fox news. “the same trans athlete played for waldorf’s girls’ volleyball team this past fall, prompting stone ridge christian to forfeit a playoff match.”

though president trump signed an executive order banning biological males from competing in women’s sports, california has said it will defy the order in accordance with the state’s law.

“the cif provides students with the opportunity to belong, connect, and compete in education-based experiences in compliance with california law [education code section 221.5. (f)] which permits students to participate in school programs and activities, including athletic teams and competitions, consistent with the student’s gender identity, irrespective of the gender listed on the student’s records,” the california interscholastic federation (cif) said in a statement.

barring a supreme court decision or federal legislation, young girls in high school and middle school may still be subject to state law regarding transgender athletes in women’s sports. the trump administration’s department of education (doe) and the office of civil rights (ocr) have been investigating the cif since it decided to defy the order.

cornerstone christian said it will play the upcoming game against san francisco waldorf as scheduled.

“as long as the parents are on board with playing the game, we will support the girls’ hard work this season and play the game,” cornerstone christian athletic director madison alexander told fox news.

candice jackson, deputy general counsel for the doe, told fox news that the department will monitor the girls’ basketball playoffs during its investigation.

“cif sets the parameters under which schools compete in these playoffs, and they have responsibility as recipients of federal funds to comply with title ix. ocr’s investigation into cif is continuing as it appears that cif’s disregard for title ix is continuing,” jackson said.","['christian', 'girl', 'basketball', 'team', 'california', 'force', 'compete', 'team', 'transgender', 'player', 'state', 'continue', 'defy', 'president', 'trump', 'recent', 'executive', 'order', 'ban', 'male', 'woman', 'sport', 'upcoming', 'high', 'school', 'girl', 'basketball', 'playoff', 'game', 'feature', 'openly', 'transgender', 'athlete', 'playing', 'san', 'francisco', 'waldorf', 'cornerstone', 'christian', 'saturday', 'report', 'fox', 'news', 'trans', 'athlete', 'play', 'waldorf', 'girl', 'volleyball', 'team', 'past', 'fall', 'prompt', 'stone', 'ridge', 'christian', 'forfeit', 'playoff', 'match', 'president', 'trump', 'sign', 'executive', 'order', 'ban', 'biological', 'male', 'compete', 'woman', 'sport', 'california', 'say', 'defy', 'order', 'accordance', 'state', 'law', 'cif', 'provide', 'student', 'opportunity', 'belong', 'connect', 'compete', 'education', 'base', 'experience', 'compliance', 'california', 'law', 'education', 'code', 'section', 'f', 'permit', 'student', 'participate', 'school', 'program', 'activity', 'include', 'athletic', 'team', 'competition', 'consistent', 'student', 'gender', 'identity', 'irrespective', 'gender', 'list', 'student', 'record', 'california', 'interscholastic', 'federation', 'cif', 'say', 'statement', 'bar', 'supreme', 'court', 'decision', 'federal', 'legislation', 'young', 'girl', 'high', 'school', 'middle', 'school', 'subject', 'state', 'law', 'transgender', 'athlete', 'woman', 'sport', 'trump', 'administration', 'department', 'education', 'doe', 'office', 'civil', 'right', 'ocr', 'investigate', 'cif', 'decide', 'defy', 'order', 'cornerstone', 'christian', 'say', 'play', 'upcoming', 'game', 'san', 'francisco', 'waldorf', 'schedule', 'long', 'parent', 'board', 'play', 'game', 'support', 'girl', 'hard', 'work', 'season', 'play', 'game', 'cornerstone', 'christian', 'athletic', 'director', 'madison', 'alexander', 'tell', 'fox', 'news', 'candice', 'jackson', 'deputy', 'general', 'counsel', 'doe', 'tell', 'fox', 'news', 'department', 'monitor', 'girl', 'basketball', 'playoff', 'investigation', 'cif', 'set', 'parameter', 'school', 'compete', 'playoff', 'responsibility', 'recipient', 'federal', 'fund', 'comply', 'title', 'ix', 'ocr', 'investigation', 'cif', 'continue', 'appear', 'cif', 'disregard', 'title', 'ix', 'continue', 'jackson', 'say']",
f98624c0-c4af-480f-b9f7-e239f96dfa6e,anti,survivors of the trans panic: detransitioner reveals horrors of gender ‘cyber-sect’,"['survivor', 'trans', 'panic', 'detransitioner', 'reveal', 'horror', 'gender', 'cyber', 'sect']",breitbart,emma-jo morris,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2023/04/10/survivors-trans-panic-de-transitioner-reveals-horrors-gender-cyber-sect/,4/10/2023,"transgenderism is being portrayed as a progressive form of self-expression by the political, media, and business complex, but it is also damaging and marring — in many cases irreparably — the girls who come into contact with it. this series is exploring some of the cruelty experienced by people who have interacted with the “cyber-sect” of radical gender ideology, through testimony in their own words.

about 20 percent of generation z is likely to identify on the “lgbtqqip2saa” spectrum, and “lgbtqia+” identification overall has become much more common in the united states in the past decade, according to 2022 polling by gallup. over five percent of americans from 18 to 30-years-old identify as “transgender” or “nonbinary,” according a pew research center survey published in june.

the number of diagnoses of “gender dysphoria” of children between the ages of 6–17 in the united states has surged over recent years, from 15,172 in 2017 to 24,847 in 2020, to 42,167 in 2021, according to data published by reuters. in 2017, there were 1,905 children in the same age range, 6–17, undergoing hormone therapy, spiking to 4,231 in 2021.

despite dubious data surrounding the practice of “gender-affirming care,” especially for adolescents, the united states is the “most permissive country” for child sex change operations and gender “transition” drug treatments compared with any european country, according to a study by do no harm. doctors who recently spoke to breitbart news, requesting their identities be concealed for fear of backlash, said there is a “perverse” monetary incentive structure built around pushing “transgender” drugs and surgeries on kids. the united states sex-reassignment surgery market was valued at almost two billion dollars in 2021 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 11.23 percent until 2030, according to a market report by grand view research.

“looking for an escape”
“oftentimes, people are looking for an escape. there’s a lot of escapism in my generation, and this is especially true with the trans ideology,” estella suarez-hamilton, a young woman who “transitioned” as a teenager and presented herself as a man, told breitbart news. “it was a distraction that i needed, to not look at the parts of my life and the relationships in my life that i was not succeeding in, and were falling apart.”

“i was looking for escape — and the political, kind of spiritual, aspects of trans ideology, when they’re combined with the online [community], that offers a type of escapism,” she continued. “a lot of times people will say that it’s a ‘cult,’ and in a way, that could be applied, but i think a more accurate term is a ‘cyber sect’.”

estella called herself “phillip” and took testosterone injections over a period of over seven years before realizing her emotional ills could not be healed by changing her hormonal composition and physical appearance. estella was recommended for hormone therapy at the age of 18 by a counselor who identifies as “transgender.” her mother was deployed with the u.s. air force at the time.

she is now in early menopause at the age of 27, despite having stopped taking testosterone a year ago.

estella views the transgender movement as a pseudo-spiritual belief system she describes as “modern gnosticism,” which includes initiation, rituals, and rules.

“if you are thinking about how to describe the sect, it is very much connected to, like, the modern gnostic principles. this is a syncretic cyber sect of modern gnosticism,” estella said, “and i love how complicated it sounds, because the trans community loves language, and they love to complicate language to the nth degree. so, i think that this term is just very — from my experience — very accurate to explain what i went through, that’s what i think happened, and that’s how i can articulate it.”

“the trans community has this stupid line, ‘when you become trans you become your authentic self.’ it’s actually the complete opposite,” pamela garfield-jaeger, licensed clinical social worker (lcsw), told breitbart news. “you’re actually becoming somebody else, you’re actually, in a way, killing off, or getting out of touch with your authentic self, and you’re now becoming this almost fake identity.”

garfield-jaeger — a licensed social worker in the bay area who practiced for 20 years after being educated at new york university and a “lifelong democrat” — spoke to breitbart news after becoming wise to what she calls a movement of “destruction of humankind,” as trans ideology relies on “dissociating people from their body, destroying their ability to procreate, and destroying the nuclear family.” she is not currently practicing, instead focusing her efforts on speaking out about the harmful effects of transgenderism and writing a curriculum for parents to find “non-indoctrinating mental health care.”

“the reason i think it has such parallels to a cult is because it finds the vulnerable people, divides them from the people who care about them, then provides this kind of faux-community. that feels really good, and feels really loving, and feels like you’re part of something, but it’s not. it’s superficial and ends up being not genuine,” garfield-jaeger told breitbart news.

“then they’re sort of policing each other’s language. they can’t really be themselves — they call it ‘authentic self,’ but they’re really being this kind of other version, this new version of themselves. you can’t break the rules. as soon as you break the rules, even just a little bit, you’re out,” she continued, describing how former members of the “community” get death threats and in some cases require security after they publicly speak out about negative experiences in their “transition.”

“it’s like they don’t want the people who are out there speaking the truth to, like, crack this spell,” she said. “really what it feels like is people are under this sort of spell. a lot of them will say that that they were under a spell. i always ask them, ‘what could someone have said or done?’ and they usually say they don’t have a good answer for it.”

“language is part of their rituals, part of the initiation is understanding the terms,” estella told breitbart news. “it’s so alien, it’s another type of language. … that’s a lot of where they get their power from — in the gnostic principles. it’s like you have this otherworldly knowledge … you have this deep understanding of the world, and yourself, and your soul, that no one can fully understand unless they also, you know, have the gnosis.”

“on the surface level, it’s pro-self-actualization, pro-sex, pro-feminine, antiestablishment, but when you investigate deeper … it’s a patriarchal spiritual movement, and the female aspects, and the pro-sex aspects, are like accessories used to justify their claims of equality,” she continued.

estella was ejected from the “community” when she expressed trepidation about having a double mastectomy and questioned why a “trans-man” cannot have breasts. at that point, after being on testosterone for a number of years, she was blocked from online trans forums and prevented from posting and engaging.

“i was not given coherent informed consent”
after being absorbed into the “cyber-sect,” the “transition” process of taking cross-sex hormones involves a litany of side effects. a woman taking testosterone will experience changes in the form of her body, shrinking hips and thighs, muscle growth, facial and body hair, cracking voice, increased sex drive. but then there are other, less predictable side effects, which, according to estella, are mostly glazed over in the process of “informed consent.”

she told breitbart news, “i was not given coherent informed consent,” explaining that side effects were told in terms of effects on men taking testosterone, not women, and that other side effects she experienced were not mentioned at all. she speculates this is because they are just not investigated. estella said that when she expressed having negative side effects, she was dismissed, saying, “if i say, ‘i have experienced this, this is something that it caused me,’ they’ll be like, ‘well, it just didn’t work out for you, that was your body.'”

according to abigail shrier’s book on the transgender movement’s effect on teenage girls, irreversible damage, testosterone will be administered based on “desired physical appearance — rather than the alleviation of physical illness — it is guided by aesthetic principles, not medical ones.”

shrier writes:

testosterone is typically justified as a treatment for ‘gender dysphoria,’ but the endocrinologists who administer it rarely seem even to be evaluating its progress with the patient’s dysphoria. what they examine instead are blood levels to ensure that testosterone stays within normal range for a man. this seems to place endocrinologists (and just as often, nurse practitioners) in the position of hair stylists, who aim to satisfy, rather than medical professionals who seek to cure.

although alleviation of gender dysphoria was supposed to be its justification, doctors administering [testosterone] very often seem less interested in treating ‘gender dysphoria’ than in giving trans-identified patients the look they want.

this reporting reflects estella’s experience with hormone treatment.

“there are expected changes, you know, your voice, and your clitoris grows, and there is a sex drive increase, muscles, you know, all the lovely… they give you all these beautiful changes that will happen, and then they kind of like whisper the shitty stuff that happens,” estella told breitbart news.

“what i went through incrementally was weakened bladder, disruption of my ph, which was recurring infections, insomnia — they say insomnia, but they don’t explain where the insomnia comes from, and it’s from excruciating heat flashes that were like itching pins and needles on my skin, and that was every single night — and that creates mental health problems, the highs and lows of hormones, and that causes strains on relationships — that’s all not addressed,” she continued. “you don’t cry when you’re on testosterone — that’s a weird side effect that is not investigated — it’s very hard to feel those … feminine emotions.”

“i was always allowed to do whatever i wanted with my hormones, like, my doctors gave me a suggested amount, but they never were like, ‘don’t do this.’ if i was like, ‘i want to go on a higher dose,’ they were like, ‘okay.’ ‘i want to go to lower dose,’ ‘okay, we’ll just take your blood and look at it’,” estella explained.

“there’s no standard,” she continued. “their job is to make your hormones match the testosterone levels of a boy the same height and weight as you, which is, to me, that’s the most pseudo-scientific thing. i don’t have testicles or semen, why would i need that much testosterone, that’s the amount of testosterone needed to maintain semen and testicles, all those things, and i don’t have that system, so why would i be given that amount, to match those levels?”

“the standardization of this prescription, prescribed transition, i think that if the doctors were going to go by ‘do no harm,’ if they were going to go by that and work by that, there would be no justification to prescribing hormones and surgery to this idea of gender dysphoria, which is very much … a consciousness issue. it’s a spiritual issue, your soul is in the wrong body,” estella said.

“rescue fantasy”
garfield-jaeger explained that health professionals and educators engage in an “emotionally abusive relationship” with vulnerable young people by engaging in an experimental treatment of promoting and “affirming” transgenderism as a solution to any number of maladaptive feelings and behaviors.

she said the “transition” process has an initial, temporary period of “euphoria,” creating positive reinforcement, despite professionals acting out “a rescue fantasy” of administering treatment that has not been demonstrated to be helpful or effective.

“i don’t understand it, in terms of from the professional side, how they can believe in this,” garfield-jaeger told breitbart. “i understand how a person can be tricked to believe in it if they’re told, ‘all of your pain and suffering will go away if you take this, almost, magic pill,’ which is become transgender, and then you get all this positive reinforcement.”

“there is a sort of honeymoon phase where you do end up having this… they call it euphoria, what they feel is euphoria. sometimes it’s even physical, because the hormones actually will, especially with testosterone, will give you a high, so it’s almost like taking a drug that gives you a high at the beginning for quite a while for them,” she explained.

“and then you also get, like, love-bombed by this community,” garfield-jaeger went on. “if you’re on a social media, you often get a whole bunch of new likes and followers and a whole bunch of, like, social status from becoming transgender. so now if you’re someone who felt very invisible in your life, you maybe were autistic, or were struggling socially in some way, or feeling alone, or feeling emotionally neglected, maybe your family was going through something, maybe your parents are going through a divorce, or for whatever reason, people weren’t there for you, even if they were there for you, you didn’t feel they were there for you, and now you’ve got these people who are saying that you’re the greatest thing on earth because you’re transgender, you almost get worshipped.”

she said that “naive” mental health providers, though, are acting out of codependence, as they do not “affirm” any number of other maladaptive behaviors, such as drug addiction or eating disorders.

“what i don’t understand … is how professionals are able to believe that this is the right thing to do,” she said. “i understand there are people who are silenced. i understand there are people who are fearful, and there are people that are maybe avoiding the topic so that they can continue to have some kind of livelihood, but i’m still having trouble understanding the people who truly are believers in this, who aren’t evil; i believe that [there] are just naive people who think they’re doing the right thing because this is about acceptance and love, and i think they’re riding out some kind of rescue fantasy … i think it’s giving helpers this feeling that they’re helping and they have this desire to help, and there’s almost a codependence happening.”

“it’s almost like an emotionally abusive relationship, like ‘mommy dearest’,” she said. “if you look at other disorders — of course now they don’t want to call it a disorder, they compare it more to an immutable characteristic, but we know that’s not the case because people are choosing to do it — if you look at other mental health issues, like an eating disorder, or drug addiction, you don’t have institutions being, like, ‘well you need to affirm their addiction,’ ‘we need to affirm their eating disorder.'”

“this is very much like, i would say, negligence. just people who maybe are well meaning and doing things that are irresponsible, just because they thought, ‘oh, well, this is the expected thing, the cool thing,” estella told breitbart news of those who treated her in her “transition.”

“i can look at myself objectively and see that i was … an 18-year-old … a young adult, who was already going through way too much, like, had too much on her shoulders. so i’ll forgive myself for making big girl decisions when i did not, you know, have the capacity to deal with the big girl consequences,” estella said, reflecting on her experience.

“i have so much love for the people who are still in this sect, because i can see them, i do see them, and i see the pain, and i remember.”","['transgenderism', 'portray', 'progressive', 'form',

6ae12ad9-d272-447b-bb2a-34a7c2c53d2e,anti,nurse says she was investigated after being attacked by trans-identifying male for saying ‘mr.’,"['nurse', 'say', 'investigate', 'attack', 'trans', 'identifying', 'male', 'say', 'mr']",daily wire,ashe schow,https://www.dailywire.com/news/nurse-says-she-was-investigated-after-being-attacked-by-trans-identifying-male-for-saying-mr?author=Ashe+Schow&category=News&elementPosition=undefined&row=0&rowType=Vertical+List&title=Nurse+Says+She+Was+Investigated+After+Being+Attacked+By+Trans-Identifying+Male+For+Saying+%E2%80%98Mr.%E2%80%99,3/24/2025,"a female nurse in england is suing after she says she was investigated and disciplined by her hospital for accidentally addressing a trans-identifying male pedophile as “mister.”

jennifer melle, 40, was treating the criminal, referred to as patient x by media outlets, after he was sent to the st. helier hospital in carshalton, surrey, from a men’s prison to receive treatment for a urinary problem, the telegraph reported. melle addressed the inmate as “mister” and “he” without knowing he identified as female.

melle said she called the patient a male when discussing with another medical professional about the need for a male catheter to be removed.

“this was a real-life medical scenario that required accurate terminology to avoid any doubt between medical professionals,” she said.

the patient overheard this conversation, and that’s when he became enraged.

when she did so, patient x took issue, and melle told him that she could not refer to him with female pronouns because “it’s against my faith and christian values but i can call you by your name.” the patient then allegedly began an angry and aggressive tirade against melle, calling her the “n-word” three times.

“imagine if i called you n*****? how about i call you n*****? yes, black n*****,” the patient yelled, according to the outlet’s review of melle’s lawsuit.

the patient also lunged at melle despite being restrained and threatened to file a complaint against her, melle alleged in her lawsuit.

“it was terrifying. i’d never been called that word before. and i thought i was going to be attacked,” she told the outlet.

despite the patient’s outburst and alleged attack, it was melle who suffered the consequences. she was investigated and disciplined by her hospital in october 2024, and received a final warning and a referral to the nursing and midwifery council, the telegraph reported. last month, she received a letter from that council, saying it was assessing her ability to continue practicing as a nurse.

the council’s code of conduct tells nurses they cannot “express your personal beliefs (including political, religious or moral beliefs) in an inappropriate way.” the council told melle that, although she “felt unable to identify patient x using the preferred pronouns due to her religion… it could be perceived that [ms melle’s] actions could… be seen as a potential breach of the code.”

melle said in her lawsuit that she did not believe she violated the council’s code and noted that a white colleague also called the patient a male but was not investigated or disciplined. she believes her christian beliefs could be to blame.

“ever since i have expressed my christian beliefs under extreme pressure, i have been a marked woman,” she said, according to the telegraph.","['female', 'nurse', 'england', 'sue', 'say', 'investigate', 'discipline', 'hospital', 'accidentally', 'address', 'trans', 'identifying', 'male', 'pedophile', 'mister', 'jennifer', 'melle', 'treat', 'criminal', 'refer', 'patient', 'x', 'medium', 'outlet', 'send', 'st', 'helier', 'hospital', 'carshalton', 'surrey', 'man', 'prison', 'receive', 'treatment', 'urinary', 'problem', 'telegraph', 'report', 'melle', 'address', 'inmate', 'mister', 'know', 'identify', 'female', 'melle', 'say', 'call', 'patient', 'male', 'discuss', 'medical', 'professional', 'need', 'male', 'catheter', 'remove', 'real', 'life', 'medical', 'scenario', 'require', 'accurate', 'terminology', 'avoid', 'doubt', 'medical', 'professional', 'say', 'patient', 'overhear', 'conversation', 'enraged', 'patient', 'x', 'take', 'issue', 'melle', 'tell', 'refer', 'female', 'pronoun', 'faith', 'christian', 'value', 'patient', 'allegedly', 'begin', 'angry', 'aggressive', 'tirade', 'melle', 'call', 'n', 'word', 'time', 'imagine', 'call', 'n', 'n', 'yes', 'black', 'n', 'patient', 'yell', 'accord', 'outlet', 'review', 'melle', 'lawsuit', 'patient', 'lunge', 'melle', 'despite', 'restrain', 'threaten', 'file', 'complaint', 'melle', 'allege', 'lawsuit', 'terrifying', 'call', 'word', 'think', 'go', 'attack', 'tell', 'outlet', 'despite', 'patient', 'outburst', 'allege', 'attack', 'melle', 'suffer', 'consequence', 'investigate', 'discipline', 'hospital', 'october', 'receive', 'final', 'warning', 'referral', 'nursing', 'midwifery', 'council', 'telegraph', 'report', 'month', 'receive', 'letter', 'council', 'say', 'assess', 'ability', 'continue', 'practice', 'nurse', 'council', 'code', 'conduct', 'tell', 'nurse', 'express', 'personal', 'belief', 'include', 'political', 'religious', 'moral', 'belief', 'inappropriate', 'way', 'council', 'tell', 'melle', 'feel', 'unable', 'identify', 'patient', 'x', 'prefer', 'pronoun', 'religion', 'perceive', 'ms', 'melle', 'action', 'see', 'potential', 'breach', 'code', 'melle', 'say', 'lawsuit', 'believe', 'violate', 'council', 'code', 'note', 'white', 'colleague', 'call', 'patient', 'male', 'investigate', 'discipline', 'believe', 'christian', 'belief', 'blame', 'express', 'christian', 'belief', 'extreme', 'pressure', 'marked', 'woman', 'say', 'accord', 'telegraph']",

when abigail wilson stepped up to compete at the disc golf pro tour’s music city open on friday morning, she cocked her arm back to throw, but then suddenly lowered her disc, turned around, and walked away from the tee area.

“females must be protected in our division,” wilson said as she walked away. “this is unfair. i refuse to play.”

she told the daily wire after the competition that she had raised concerns a day earlier, and was reprimanded for misgendering her competition. the trans-identifying male disc golfer, natalie ryan, was set to play at the same tee time as wilson in the women’s division. ryan has sparked controversy since at least 2022 when he defeated the world’s number one ranked female competitor, kristin tattar.

wilson said this made her anxious because she had heard protests were planned against the trans-identifying player, and last year, a terrorism threat against the same player caused the music city open to be temporarily suspended. wilson played in last year’s event as well.

“they did a terrible job of keeping us safe during the event when this threat was called in,” wilson told the daily wire. “i said, ‘well, it is a very unpleasant thing that all of us women have to play with him.’ after i said the word ‘him,’ this disc golf staff member told me that if i misgender him again, i will be penalized and removed from the tour, and he’s going to pretend he didn’t hear me say that.”

wilson said staff also assured her that the event would have police, security, and bag checks, but she saw none of that when she arrived, and she was allowed in without showing her credentials.

“there were zero security precautions,” she said.

jeff spring, ceo and director of the disc golf pro tour said they did have security on site, including an on-duty police officer, plain clothes security staff, and armed security guards, and they did conduct bag checks for spectators. wilson was “cleared through our spectator entrance and recognized as an approved player upon arrival,” he said.

spring also said that the disc golf pro tour “supports abigail’s right to protest and have her voice heard.”

“there is no consequence for abigail’s protest today, as she violated no rules or policies,” he said. “we encourage all players to do what they think is right. abigail is welcome to compete on the same playing field as all other players and we wish her the best in her young career.”

wilson previously said she assumes she will no longer be welcomed to play in disc golf pro tour competitions, the highest level of disc golf, but she does not regret her decision to walk away on friday.

“i couldn’t keep putting my head down,” she told the daily wire. “i like to say that i throw plastic at metal chains for a living, and it’s not worth any of this. we shouldn’t have to deal with this as women, as professionals.”

“today i most likely ended my career and that is okay because this is bigger than me,” wilson said on social media after walking off the competition.

“i have worked so hard to get to this point to play on the dgpt, but the sacrifice of my career and my hard work is worth it if it means i can make a difference for other women, daughters, nieces, and the future of our sport,” she said. “if you feel how wrong it is to have biological males be competing in female protected divisions in sports, now is the time to speak up and stand your ground.”

spring, the disc golf pro tour director said any changes to the sport’s transgender participation policy will likely be derived from changes to international olympic committee policy and state and federal law.","['professional', 'disc', 'golf', 'athlete', 'walk', 'course', 'nashville', 'competition', 'friday', 'concern', 'trans', 'identify', 'male', 'player', 'tell', 'daily', 'wire', 'warn', 'speak', 'abigail', 'wilson', 'step', 'compete', 'disc', 'golf', 'pro', 'tour', 'music', 'city', 'open', 'friday', 'morning', 'cock', 'arm', 'throw', 'suddenly', 'lower', 'disc', 'turn', 'walk', 'away', 'tee', 'area', 'female', 'protect', 'division', 'wilson', 'say', 'walk', 'away', 'unfair', 'refuse', 'play', 'tell', 'daily', 'wire', 'competition', 'raise', 'concern', 'day', 'early', 'reprimand', 'misgendere', 'competition', 'trans', 'identifying', 'male', 'disc', 'golfer', 'natalie', 'ryan', 'set', 'play', 'tee', 'time', 'wilson', 'woman', 'division', 'ryan', 'spark', 'controversy', 'defeat', 'world', 'number', 'rank', 'female', 'competitor', 'kristin', 'tattar', 'wilson', 'say', 'anxious', 'hear', 'protest', 'plan', 'trans', 'identifying', 'player', 'year', 'terrorism', 'threat', 'player', 'cause', 'music', 'city', 'open', 'temporarily', 'suspend', 'wilson', 'play', 'year', 'event', 'terrible', 'job', 'keep', 'safe', 'event', 'threat', 'call', 'wilson', 'tell', 'daily', 'wire', 'say', 'unpleasant', 'thing', 'woman', 'play', 'say', 'word', 'disc', 'golf', 'staff', 'member', 'tell', 'misgender', 'penalize', 'remove', 'tour', 'go', 'pretend', 'hear', 'wilson', 'say', 'staff', 'assure', 'event', 'police', 'security', 'bag', 'check', 'see', 'arrive', 'allow', 'show', 'credential', 'zero', 'security', 'precaution', 'say', 'jeff', 'spring', 'ceo', 'director', 'disc', 'golf', 'pro', 'tour', 'say', 'security', 'site', 'include', 'duty', 'police', 'officer', 'plain', 'clothe', 'security', 'staff', 'armed', 'security', 'guard', 'conduct', 'bag', 'check', 'spectator', 'wilson', 'clear', 'spectator', 'entrance', 'recognize', 'approved', 'player', 'arrival', 'say', 'spring', 'say', 'disc', 'golf', 'pro', 'tour', 'support', 'abigail', 'right', 'protest', 'voice', 'hear', 'consequence', 'abigail', 'protest', 'today', 'violate', 'rule', 'policy', 'say', 'encourage', 'player', 'think', 'right', 'abigail', 'welcome', 'compete', 'playing', 'field', 'player', 'wish', 'good', 'young', 'career', 'wilson', 'previously', 'say', 'assume', 'long', 'welcome', 'play', 'disc', 'golf', 'pro', 'tour', 'competition', 'high', 'level', 'disc', 'golf', 'regret', 'decision', 'walk', 'away', 'friday', 'put', 'head', 'tell', 'daily', 'wire', 'like', 'throw', 'plastic', 'metal', 'chain', 'living', 'worth', 'deal', 'woman', 'professional', 'today', 'likely', 'end', 'career', 'okay', 'big', 'wilson', 'say', 'social', 'medium', 'walk', 'competition', 'work', 'hard', 'point', 'play', 'dgpt', 'sacrifice', 'career', 'hard', 'work', 'worth', 'mean', 'difference', 'woman', 'daughter', 'niece', 'future', 'sport', 'say', 'feel', 'wrong', 'biological', 'male', 'compete', 'female', 'protect', 'division', 'sport', 'time', 'speak', 'stand', 'ground', 'spring', 'disc', 'golf', 'pro', 'tour', 'director', 'say', 'change', 'sport', 'transgender', 'participation', 'policy', 'likely', 'derive', 'change', 'international', 'olympic', 'committee', 'policy', 'state', 'federal', 'law']",

a significant majority, 66% of americans, say federal tax dollars should not go toward “gender transition” procedures such as surgeries, cross-sex hormones, or puberty blockers, according to a new cygnal poll from the american principles project provided exclusively to the daily wire.

the poll found that if an american voter knows a democrat candidate supports using tax dollars to pay for “gender transition” procedures, 52% of those voters will vote republican over that democrat candidate.

democrats initially held a one-point lead in the poll on a 2026 congressional midterm ballot, but when the poll-takers were informed the democrat supports using tax dollars to pay for “gender transition” procedures, the electorate moved a net 14 points toward the republican candidate.

even 42% of democrats and 43% of kamala harris voters said tax dollars should not be spent on “gender transitions,” the poll found. about two thirds, 66% of swing voters, said so as well.

even 60% of women, who consistently lean democrat, agreed they do not want tax dollars going toward medical “gender transitions.”

majorities of black and hispanic americans, parents as well as unmarried men and women, and urban and suburban voters agreed as well, the poll showed.

“this poll is proof of what we’ve known for a long time – the majority of americans do not want their tax dollars being spent on gender transitions,” terry schilling, president of the american principles project, said in a statement to the daily wire.

“i am glad that president trump has already begun to take action on this popular, commonsense policy, but now it’s time for congress to make the ban on federal funding for gender transitions permanent,” schilling said.

gender ideology in schools, transgender drugs and surgeries on minors, trans-identifying males in women’s sports and prisons all became hot button issues during the election cycle.

president donald trump’s most effective campaign ad in the past election cycle highlighted harris’ support for taxpayer-funded transgender medical services for prisoners.

“kamala is for they/them. president trump is for you,” the ad said.

the ad aired across the nation, including during football games. trump advisors said the message reached suburban women, who were also being hammered with democrats’ aggressive abortion ads.

democrats are struggling to find a cohesive messaging strategy after they were walloped in the november election, losing every swing state to trump.

however, some democrats are already reading the room. california governor gavin newsom backed away from his previous embrace of transgender issues on his podcast last month, calling men in women’s sports “deeply unfair.”","['americans', 'want', 'federal', 'tax', 'dollar', 'pay', 'transgender', 'medical', 'procedure', 'new', 'polling', 'show', 'significant', 'majority', 'americans', 'federal', 'tax', 'dollar', 'gender', 'transition', 'procedure', 'surgery', 'cross', 'sex', 'hormone', 'puberty', 'blocker', 'accord', 'new', 'cygnal', 'poll', 'american', 'principle', 'project', 'provide', 'exclusively', 'daily', 'wire', 'poll', 'find', 'american', 'voter', 'know', 'democrat', 'candidate', 'support', 'tax', 'dollar', 'pay', 'gender', 'transition', 'procedure', 'voter', 'vote', 'republican', 'democrat', 'candidate', 'democrats', 'initially', 'hold', 'point', 'lead', 'poll', 'congressional', 'midterm', 'ballot', 'poll', 'taker', 'inform', 'democrat', 'support', 'tax', 'dollar', 'pay', 'gender', 'transition', 'procedure', 'electorate', 'move', 'net', 'point', 'republican', 'candidate', 'democrats', 'kamala', 'harris', 'voters', 'say', 'tax', 'dollar', 'spend', 'gender', 'transition', 'poll', 'find', 'third', 'swing', 'voter', 'say', 'woman', 'consistently', 'lean', 'democrat', 'agree', 'want', 'tax', 'dollar', 'go', 'medical', 'gender', 'transition', 'majority', 'black', 'hispanic', 'americans', 'parent', 'unmarried', 'man', 'woman', 'urban', 'suburban', 'voter', 'agree', 'poll', 'show', 'poll', 'proof', 'know', 'long', 'time', 'majority', 'americans', 'want', 'tax', 'dollar', 'spend', 'gender', 'transition', 'terry', 'schilling', 'president', 'american', 'principle', 'project', 'say', 'statement', 'daily', 'wire', 'glad', 'president', 'trump', 'begin', 'action', 'popular', 'commonsense', 'policy', 'time', 'congress', 'ban', 'federal', 'funding', 'gender', 'transition', 'permanent', 'schille', 'say', 'gender', 'ideology', 'school', 'transgender', 'drug', 'surgery', 'minor', 'trans', 'identify', 'male', 'woman', 'sport', 'prison', 'hot', 'button', 'issue', 'election', 'cycle', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'effective', 'campaign', 'ad', 'past', 'election', 'cycle', 'highlight', 'harris', 'support', 'taxpayer', 'fund', 'transgender', 'medical', 'service', 'prisoner', 'kamala', 'president', 'trump', 'ad', 'say', 'ad', 'air', 'nation', 'include', 'football', 'game', 'trump', 'advisor', 'say', 'message', 'reach', 'suburban', 'woman', 'hammer', 'democrat', 'aggressive', 'abortion', 'ad', 'democrats', 'struggle', 'find', 'cohesive', 'message', 'strategy', 'wallop', 'november', 'election', 'lose', 'swing', 'state', 'trump', 'democrats', 'read', 'room', 'california', 'governor', 'gavin', 'newsom', 'back', 'away', 'previous', 'embrace', 'transgender', 'issue', 'podcast', 'month', 'call', 'man', 'woman', 'sport', 'deeply', 'unfair']",

“i understand and i’ve seen the effects of what these blockers do, what these hormones do, and what these surgeries do,” haim told lawmakers on the house judiciary committee’s subcommittee on the constitution and limited government.

haim said he sees serious complications with transgender genital surgeries “all the time.

“we’re talking about urethral stenosis, where you can’t go out to a coffee shop and go to the bathroom because the urethra is narrowed so that fluid builds up in the bladder,” he said.

in males who have had genital surgery to create a “neovagina,” fistulas can happen, “where stool from the rectum can pour into the wound that they call the neovagina,” haim said.

“a lot of them don’t see these problems in the first couple of months or even the first couple of years, but this is what happens.”

“we would take children to the operating room, and we would make them better,” he said. “but in the same operating room they were taking them there and making them sick.”

“they are destroying the lives of these children,” he said. “they’re putting them down a road where they become a chronic medical patient that they can never come back from.”

“could i call myself a doctor if i didn’t speak against it?” he said.

haim also told lawmakers about the biden administration’s failed criminal prosecution against him.

back in 2023, haim went to the media anonymously and exposed the houston children’s hospital for secretly continuing to perform transgender medical procedures on children despite the hospital’s public statements saying they had paused them.

in response, the biden justice department sent federal agents to his house and charged haim with four felonies related to hipaa.

the trump administration dismissed the charges against haim shortly after president donald trump’s inauguration.

vanessa sivadge, the former nurse at texas children’s hospital who also became a whistleblower, testified on wednesday as well.

“i witnessed how doctors emotionally blackmailed by telling them that if they did not affirm their child’s delusion, their child would harm themselves,” sivadge told lawmakers.

“in particular, i was saddened to see young girls suffering from profound mental health struggles like depression or anxiety, many of whom had also suffered sexual abuse or trauma persuaded by doctors at tch that hormones would resolve their gender confusion. history books will one day record this emotional blackmail as the greatest lie ever sold by the medical industrial complex to vulnerable parents and confused children,” she said.

also during wednesday’s congressional hearing, rep. jamie raskin (d-md) said he believed not vaccinating children in texas against measles was “child abuse,” but he did not say the same about transgender drugs and procedures.

raskin also went back and forth with haim’s attorney, mark lytle, who corrected several of raskin’s statements about the alleged hipaa violations.

meanwhile, rep. mary scanlon (d-pa) brought up a range of unrelated topics including elon musk, child hunger, budget cuts, unemployed federal workers, and even gun violence.","['dr', 'eithan', 'haim', 'surgeon', 'blow', 'whistle', 'texas', 'child', 'hospital', 'provide', 'transgender', 'procedure', 'drug', 'minor', 'testify', 'congress', 'wednesday', 'horror', 'medical', 'intervention', 'understand', 'see', 'effect', 'blocker', 'hormone', 'surgery', 'haim', 'tell', 'lawmaker', 'house', 'judiciary', 'committee', 'subcommittee', 'constitution', 'limited', 'government', 'haim', 'say', 'see', 'complication', 'transgender', 'genital', 'surgery', 'time', 'talk', 'urethral', 'stenosis', 'coffee', 'shop', 'bathroom', 'urethra', 'narrow', 'fluid', 'build', 'bladder', 'say', 'male', 'genital', 'surgery', 'create', 'neovagina', 'fistula', 'happen', 'stool', 'rectum', 'pour', 'wound', 'neovagina', 'haim', 'say', 'lot', 'problem', 'couple', 'month', 'couple', 'year', 'happen', 'child', 'operating', 'room', 'well', 'say', 'operating', 'room', 'take', 'make', 'sick', 'destroy', 'life', 'child', 'say', 'put', 'road', 'chronic', 'medical', 'patient', 'come', 'doctor', 'speak', 'say', 'haim', 'tell', 'lawmaker', 'biden', 'administration', 'fail', 'criminal', 'prosecution', 'haim', 'go', 'medium', 'anonymously', 'expose', 'houston', 'children', 'hospital', 'secretly', 'continue', 'perform', 'transgend', 'medical', 'procedure', 'child', 'despite', 'hospital', 'public', 'statement', 'say', 'pause', 'response', 'biden', 'justice', 'department', 'send', 'federal', 'agent', 'house', 'charge', 'haim', 'felony', 'relate', 'hipaa', 'trump', 'administration', 'dismiss', 'charge', 'haim', 'shortly', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'inauguration', 'vanessa', 'sivadge', 'nurse', 'texas', 'children', 'hospital', 'whistleblower', 'testify', 'wednesday', 'witness', 'doctor', 'emotionally', 'blackmail', 'tell', 'affirm', 'child', 'delusion', 'child', 'harm', 'sivadge', 'tell', 'lawmaker', 'particular', 'sadden', 'young', 'girl', 'suffer', 'profound', 'mental', 'health', 'struggle', 'like', 'depression', 'anxiety', 'suffer', 'sexual', 'abuse', 'trauma', 'persuade', 'doctor', 'tch', 'hormone', 'resolve', 'gender', 'confusion', 'history', 'book', 'day', 'record', 'emotional', 'blackmail', 'great', 'lie', 'sell', 'medical', 'industrial', 'complex', 'vulnerable', 'parent', 'confused', 'child', 'say', 'wednesday', 'congressional', 'hearing', 'rep', 'jamie', 'raskin', 'd', 'md', 'say', 'believe', 'vaccinate', 'child', 'texas', 'measle', 'child', 'abuse', 'transgender', 'drug', 'procedure', 'raskin', 'go', 'forth', 'haim', 'attorney', 'mark', 'lytle', 'correct', 'raskin', 'statement', 'alleged', 'hipaa', 'violation', 'rep', 'mary', 'scanlon', 'd', 'pa', 'bring', 'range', 'unrelated', 'topic', 'include', 'elon', 'musk', 'child', 'hunger', 'budget', 'cut', 'unemployed', 'federal', 'worker', 'gun', 'violence']",

the rutherford county library board voted 5-3 in favor of a resolution to take books encouraging children to adopt radical gender ideology off their shelves. the vote came after a tense 2-hour meeting attended by over 100 community members who showed up at the historic rutherford county courthouse in murfreesboro, about 34 miles from nashville, to hear debate on the resolution.

the resolution directed the library to “remove material that promotes, encourages, advocates for or normalizes transgenderism or ‘gender confusion’ in minors.”

after the vote was taken, a group of supporters of the resolution, who showed up wearing white shirts, erupted with cheers and clapping. opponents, who heckled the board throughout the meeting, shouted things like “nazis!” at the library board. during debate on the resolution, audience members would break out in cheers after a board member spoke in favor of their position.

cody york, who introduced the measure, said that he did so because the board had an obligation to protect children.

“the library board is expending money to keep books on the shelf. by just keeping a book we are making a decision to expend funds, taxpayer dollars, to keep those books there,” york said. “books that promote transgender ideology are harmful to children.”

york referenced detransitioners across the country who have sued their doctors for performing transgender medical procedures on them.

“the state and federal government have determined that these are harmful practices,” york said, pointing to president donald trump’s executive order that the federal government would not promote transgender procedures on kids. “the fact that some children in our community struggle with gender confusion means that we should be equipping them to successfully deal with the dangers of, and root cause of, that danger.”

before the votes, 10 community members were given 3 minutes each to speak.

“if we cause children to go down this road, they can make decisions they will regret for the rest of their lives. when we expose them to things that they don’t have a level to understand, it’s really sexualizing them,” a woman named michelle said, urging the board to take away books promoting transgender ideology. “children, they don’t have a capacity for this. if we say we love them, if we say that ‘you are loved,’ ‘we loved you,’ we should want to tell that person the truth. love is truth.”

under the new policy, staff at libraries across the county would have to flag books promoting transgender ideology to kids and turn them over to the board for evaluation.

board members who voted in favor included york, marzee woodard, dina piazza, and susan quesenberry. those who voted against included benjamin groce, kory wells, and rollie holden.

previously, in the meeting the board voted to remove a book called “me & my dysphoria monster,” a children’s illustrated book that tells the story of a boy who believes that he is a girl who meets a “trans man” who teaches him about gender dysphoria.

that vote was 5-2 along almost the same lines as the other vote, except with an abstention from holden.

tennessee state lawmakers have already moved to get sexually explicit books out of school libraries, and this new rutherford county resolution would enact a similar policy at the county level for transgender ideology.","['murfreesboro', 'tenn', 'tennessee', 'library', 'board', 'vote', 'monday', 'evening', 'remove', 'book', 'promote', 'transgenderism', 'child', 'system', 'face', 'protester', 'call', 'nazi', 'take', 'stand', 'rutherford', 'county', 'library', 'board', 'vote', 'favor', 'resolution', 'book', 'encourage', 'child', 'adopt', 'radical', 'gender', 'ideology', 'shelf', 'vote', 'come', 'tense', 'hour', 'meeting', 'attend', 'community', 'member', 'show', 'historic', 'rutherford', 'county', 'courthouse', 'murfreesboro', 'mile', 'nashville', 'hear', 'debate', 'resolution', 'resolution', 'direct', 'library', 'remove', 'material', 'promote', 'encourage', 'advocate', 'normalize', 'transgenderism', 'gender', 'confusion', 'minor', 'vote', 'take', 'group', 'supporter', 'resolution', 'show', 'wear', 'white', 'shirt', 'erupt', 'cheer', 'clapping', 'opponent', 'heckle', 'board', 'meeting', 'shout', 'thing', 'like', 'nazi', 'library', 'board', 'debate', 'resolution', 'audience', 'member', 'break', 'cheer', 'board', 'member', 'speak', 'favor', 'position', 'cody', 'york', 'introduce', 'measure', 'say', 'board', 'obligation', 'protect', 'child', 'library', 'board', 'expend', 'money', 'book', 'shelf', 'keep', 'book', 'make', 'decision', 'expend', 'fund', 'taxpayer', 'dollar', 'book', 'york', 'say', 'book', 'promote', 'transgender', 'ideology', 'harmful', 'child', 'york', 'reference', 'detransitioner', 'country', 'sue', 'doctor', 'perform', 'transgend', 'medical', 'procedure', 'state', 'federal', 'government', 'determine', 'harmful', 'practice', 'york', 'say', 'point', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'executive', 'order', 'federal', 'government', 'promote', 'transgender', 'procedure', 'kid', 'fact', 'child', 'community', 'struggle', 'gender', 'confusion', 'mean', 'equip', 'successfully', 'deal', 'danger', 'root', 'cause', 'danger', 'vote', 'community', 'member', 'give', 'minute', 'speak', 'cause', 'child', 'road', 'decision', 'regret', 'rest', 'life', 'expose', 'thing', 'level', 'understand', 'sexualize', 'woman', 'name', 'michelle', 'say', 'urge', 'board', 'away', 'book', 'promote', 'transgend', 'ideology', 'child', 'capacity', 'love', 'love', 'love', 'want', 'tell', 'person', 'truth', 'love', 'truth', 'new', 'policy', 'staff', 'library', 'county', 'flag', 'book', 'promote', 'transgender', 'ideology', 'kid', 'turn', 'board', 'evaluation', 'board', 'member', 'vote', 'favor', 'include', 'york', 'marzee', 'woodard', 'dina', 'piazza', 'susan', 'quesenberry', 'vote', 'include', 'benjamin', 'groce', 'kory', 'wells', 'rollie', 'holden', 'previously', 'meeting', 'board', 'vote', 'remove', 'book', 'call', 'dysphoria', 'monster', 'child', 'illustrate', 'book', 'tell', 'story', 'boy', 'believe', 'girl', 'meet', 'trans', 'man', 'teach', 'gender', 'dysphoria', 'vote', 'line', 'vote', 'abstention', 'holden', 'tennessee', 'state', 'lawmaker', 'move', 'sexually', 'explicit', 'book', 'school', 'library', 'new', 'rutherford', 'county', 'resolution', 'enact', 'similar', 'policy', 'county', 'level', 'transgender', 'ideology']",

nicole georgas told the story of what she said happened to her 13-year-old daughter and other girls at shepard middle school while speaking at a deerfield school district 109 school board meeting on thursday, national review reported. deerfield is a suburb of chicago. georgas said her daughter came home upset on february 5, saying a boy was using the girl’s bathroom.

according to georgas, the girl was then told by school administrators that the boy was allowed to use the girl’s locker room and bathroom because he identified as a girl, and the school’s “inclusive” bathroom policy allowed him to use whichever locker room he wanted. georgas said she spoke to school administrators and told them they were violating president donald trump’s executive order that prohibited males from using female locker rooms and participating in girls’ sports. the school stood its ground, citing the district’s legal counsel.

after this exchange, georgas said thursday, “the situation went from bad to worse.”

“a few days later, the male student was present in the girl’s locker room. feeling violated, the girls made the choice not to change into their pe clothes with the biological male student present,” georgas said.

the mother said that school administrators then supervised the girls’ locker room to make sure that the girls changed their clothes in front of the transgender-identifying boy without protest. she identified the district’s assistant superintendent for student services, the school’s assistant principal, and the director for student services as the administrators who forced the girls to change in front of the boy, according to the lake county gazette.

“the girls just want their privacy and they want their locker room back,” she said. “there are gender neutral options. this is my daughter’s story, and the story of many other young girls who have been forced at the difficult age to do something they know and most adults know is wrong.”

georgas’ story received boos from transgender activists in attendance at the school board meeting, including one transgender-identifying person who also happens to have a child identifying as transgender.

“the discomfort or privacy concerns of other students, teachers, or parents are not valid reasons to deny or limit the full and equal use of those facilities based on a student’s gender-related identity,” said the activist, who serves as the director of operations for trans up front, an activist organization. “instead, any student, teacher or other individuals seeking more privacy should be accommodated by providing that individual with a more private option.”

georgas said she filed a civil rights complaint with the justice department.","['mother', 'girl', 'attend', 'illinois', 'middle', 'school', 'say', 'daughter', 'refuse', 'change', 'clothe', 'biological', 'boy', 'identify', 'transgender', 'girl', 'school', 'official', 'step', 'force', 'nicole', 'georgas', 'tell', 'story', 'say', 'happen', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'girl', 'shepard', 'middle', 'school', 'speak', 'deerfield', 'school', 'district', 'school', 'board', 'meeting', 'thursday', 'national', 'review', 'report', 'deerfield', 'suburb', 'chicago', 'georgas', 'say', 'daughter', 'come', 'home', 'upset', 'february', 'say', 'boy', 'girl', 'bathroom', 'accord', 'georgas', 'girl', 'tell', 'school', 'administrator', 'boy', 'allow', 'use', 'girl', 'locker', 'room', 'bathroom', 'identify', 'girl', 'school', 'inclusive', 'bathroom', 'policy', 'allow', 'use', 'whichever', 'locker', 'room', 'want', 'georgas', 'say', 'speak', 'school', 'administrator', 'tell', 'violate', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'executive', 'order', 'prohibit', 'male', 'female', 'locker', 'room', 'participate', 'girl', 'sport', 'school', 'stand', 'ground', 'cite', 'district', 'legal', 'counsel', 'exchange', 'georgas', 'say', 'thursday', 'situation', 'go', 'bad', 'bad', 'day', 'later', 'male', 'student', 'present', 'girl', 'locker', 'room', 'feeling', 'violate', 'girl', 'choice', 'change', 'pe', 'clothe', 'biological', 'male', 'student', 'present', 'georgas', 'say', 'mother', 'say', 'school', 'administrator', 'supervise', 'girl', 'locker', 'room', 'sure', 'girl', 'change', 'clothe', 'transgender', 'identify', 'boy', 'protest', 'identify', 'district', 'assistant', 'superintendent', 'student', 'service', 'school', 'assistant', 'principal', 'director', 'student', 'service', 'administrator', 'force', 'girl', 'change', 'boy', 'accord', 'lake', 'county', 'gazette', 'girl', 'want', 'privacy', 'want', 'locker', 'room', 'say', 'gender', 'neutral', 'option', 'daughter', 'story', 'story', 'young', 'girl', 'force', 'difficult', 'age', 'know', 'adult', 'know', 'wrong', 'georgas', 'story', 'receive', 'boo', 'transgender', 'activist', 'attendance', 'school', 'board', 'meeting', 'include', 'transgender', 'identify', 'person', 'happen', 'child', 'identify', 'transgender', 'discomfort', 'privacy', 'concern', 'student', 'teacher', 'parent', 'valid', 'reason', 'deny', 'limit', 'equal', 'use', 'facility', 'base', 'student', 'gender', 'relate', 'identity', 'say', 'activist', 'serve', 'director', 'operation', 'tran', 'activist', 'organization', 'instead', 'student', 'teacher', 'individual', 'seek', 'privacy', 'accommodate', 'provide', 'individual', 'private', 'option', 'georgas', 'say', 'file', 'civil', 'right', 'complaint', 'justice', 'department']",

“effective immediately, all new accessions for individuals with a history of gender dysphoria are paused, and all unscheduled, scheduled, or planned medical procedures associated with affirming or facilitating a gender transition for service members are paused,” the statement said.

maher made the remarks on the leftist podcast “pod save america” with former obama speechwriter jon lovett.

“the democratic position in [california] has been that the school has the right to hide it from the parents,” maher said. “that is not something that’s going to go well with the average voter.”

he said that in far-left parts of america, schools “constantly had this idea in the minds of children that maybe you’re not in the right body.”

“i mean, the new england journal of medicine advocated for taking sex off of a birth certificate,” he said. “it was like, ‘your assigned sex at birth.’ well i was assigned it by my dick, okay, when i was born. and again, to tell kids, it doesn’t always have to be and isn’t always the default setting, but that’s a different mentality than they put in the minds of kids, and that’s why this debate goes on.”

he said that people were fed up with being told that they were bigots if they wanted to even debate the topic.

“and the fact that you think, or a lot of people on the left think, that even if you just have this debate, it makes you a bigot, you just have to roll over … that was their position,” he said. “if you even question this, you’re some sort of a bigot. and this is new science. and it has to do with children. and it’s not going to look good in the future, that position.”","['bill', 'maher', 'host', 'hbo', 'real', 'time', 'say', 'interview', 'late', 'week', 'democrats', 'need', 'drop', 'support', 'transgender', 'movement', 'want', 'start', 'win', 'maher', 'remark', 'leftist', 'podcast', 'pod', 'save', 'america', 'obama', 'speechwriter', 'jon', 'lovett', 'democratic', 'position', 'california', 'school', 'right', 'hide', 'parent', 'maher', 'say', 'go', 'average', 'voter', 'say', 'far', 'leave', 'part', 'america', 'school', 'constantly', 'idea', 'mind', 'child', 'maybe', 'right', 'body', 'mean', 'new', 'england', 'journal', 'medicine', 'advocate', 'take', 'sex', 'birth', 'certificate', 'say', 'like', 'assign', 'sex', 'birth', 'assign', 'dick', 'okay', 'bear', 'tell', 'kid', 'default', 'setting', 'different', 'mentality', 'mind', 'kid', 'debate', 'go', 'say', 'people', 'feed', 'tell', 'bigot', 'want', 'debate', 'topic', 'fact', 'think', 'lot', 'people', 'left', 'think', 'debate', 'make', 'bigot', 'roll', 'position', 'say', 'question', 'sort', 'bigot', 'new', 'science', 'child', 'go', 'look', 'good', 'future', 'position']",

in a letter to the clerk of the supreme court, deputy solicitor general curtis gannon said that the doj no longer took the position that tennessee’s sb 1, which banned transgender medical procedures on minors, violated the fourteenth amendment. the court heard a challenge to the law in december from both the biden administration and the aclu. 

“following the change in administration, the department of justice has reconsidered the united states’ position in this case,” gannon wrote. “the purpose of this letter is to notify the court that the government’s previously stated views no longer represent the united states’ position.”

tennessee’s law bans procedures like giving minors puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones and performing surgeries like removing the breasts of girls who identify as boys. 

the law was temporarily blocked by a federal judge after it was passed in 2023 before the sixth circuit court of appeals allowed the law to take effect. 

“the department has now determined that sb1 does not deny equal protection on account of sex or any other characteristic. accordingly, the new administration would not have intervened to challenge sb1 — let alone sought this court’s review of the court of appeals’ decision reversing the preliminary injunction against sb1,” gannon wrote. 

while the doj’s challenge to the law may now be moot, the aclu’s suit against it still stands. additionally, the doj said that it is not seeking to dismiss the case, saying that a “prompt resolution of the question presented will bear on many cases pending in the lower courts.”

after oral arguments on the case in december, the supreme court appears poised to rule in tennessee’s favor. justices clarence thomas, samuel alito, brett kavanaugh, john roberts, and amy coney barrett all seemed skeptical of the claims made by the aclu and the previous biden administration. 

tennessee attorney general jonathan skrmetti praised the doj for dropping its opposition and noted that the state also welcomed a decision from the court. 

“we commend president trump for abandoning the previous administration’s effort to enshrine gender ideology into the constitution and prevent the people’s elected officials from resolving these important and contentious issues,” skrmetti said. “we look forward to receiving much-needed clarity when the court issues its decision.”","['justice', 'department', 'tell', 'supreme', 'court', 'friday', 'drop', 'challenge', 'tennessee', 'law', 'shielding', 'child', 'transgender', 'medical', 'procedure', 'letter', 'clerk', 'supreme', 'court', 'deputy', 'solicitor', 'general', 'curtis', 'gannon', 'say', 'doj', 'long', 'take', 'position', 'tennessee', 'sb', 'ban', 'transgend', 'medical', 'procedure', 'minor', 'violate', 'fourteenth', 'amendment', 'court', 'hear', 'challenge', 'law', 'december', 'biden', 'administration', 'aclu', 'follow', 'change', 'administration', 'department', 'justice', 'reconsider', 'united', 'states', 'position', 'case', 'gannon', 'write', 'purpose', 'letter', 'notify', 'court', 'government', 'previously', 'state', 'view', 'long', 'represent', 'united', 'states', 'position', 'tennessee', 'law', 'ban', 'procedure', 'like', 'give', 'minor', 'puberty', 'blocker', 'cross', 'sex', 'hormone', 'perform', 'surgery', 'like', 'remove', 'breast', 'girl', 'identify', 'boy', 'law', 'temporarily', 'block', 'federal', 'judge', 'pass', 'sixth', 'circuit', 'court', 'appeal', 'allow', 'law', 'effect', 'department', 'determine', 'deny', 'equal', 'protection', 'account', 'sex', 'characteristic', 'accordingly', 'new', 'administration', 'intervene', 'challenge', 'let', 'seek', 'court', 'review', 'court', 'appeal', 'decision', 'reverse', 'preliminary', 'injunction', 'gannon', 'write', 'doj', 'challenge', 'law', 'moot', 'aclu', 'suit', 'stand', 'additionally', 'doj', 'say', 'seek', 'dismiss', 'case', 'say', 'prompt', 'resolution', 'question', 'present', 'bear', 'case', 'pende', 'low', 'court', 'oral', 'argument', 'case', 'december', 'supreme', 'court', 'appear', 'poise', 'rule', 'tennessee', 'favor', 'justice', 'clarence', 'thomas', 'samuel', 'alito', 'brett', 'kavanaugh', 'john', 'roberts', 'amy', 'coney', 'barrett', 'skeptical', 'claim', 'aclu', 'previous', 'biden', 'administration', 'tennessee', 'attorney', 'general', 'jonathan', 'skrmetti', 'praise', 'doj', 'drop', 'opposition', 'note', 'state', 'welcome', 'decision', 'court', 'commend', 'president', 'trump', 'abandon', 'previous', 'administration', 'effort', 'enshrine', 'gender', 'ideology', 'constitution', 'prevent', 'people', 'elect', 'official', 'resolve', 'important', 'contentious', 'issue', 'skrmetti', 'say', 'look', 'forward', 'receive', 'need', 'clarity', 'court', 'issue', 'decision']",

the president will sign the executive action at 3:00 p.m. on wednesday, surrounded by advocates who have fought against gender ideology and for the preservation of women’s spaces. it is not immediately clear whether that order will focus on k-12 sports, collegiate sports, or a broad ban on men competing as trans-identifying females in women’s sports.


trump has long promised to ban men who identify as women from participating in female sports, citing high-profile stories such as that of riley gaines, an athlete forced to compete against a man who identified as a female swimmer named lia thomas. gaines, who did not respond to a request for comment, will address the republican study committee on gender issues wednesday, the daily wire reported.

during the 2024 election cycle, trump and his team embraced this issue, voicing the concerns of american parents across the country — that their daughters’ private spaces were being invaded by men, that their opportunities were being taken away, and that all of this was being done in the name of gender ideology.

leading up to election day, trump advisors told the daily wire that the messaging was reaching women, specifically suburban women, the very same population that democrats were targeting with aggressive abortion messaging. the wall street journal predicted that trans-identifying males in women’s sports would be the 2024 sleeper issue.

throughout his campaign, trump repeatedly stated that kamala harris and democrats were pushing a dangerous ideology that americans didn’t want. he argued repeatedly that the far-left policies the democratic party embraced were “crazy.” his assertions were based on polling, both internal and external, as the daily wire reported, showing that americans don’t want these radical transgender policies.

“the sickos who are pushing sexual content in kindergartens, or providing puberty blockers to young children who have no idea what a puberty blocker is,” he said in 2022, drawing laughs from the crowd. “neither do i, by the way. neither do most of the people in the audience, as you smile.”

trump specifically promised to “keep men out of women’s sports.” that messaging, and the messaging of republican candidates across the country, caused at least three major democrats to reverse their stances on men in women’s sports in the days ahead of the election, in texas, alaska, and pennsylvania.

wednesday is the 39th annual national girls & women in sports day.","['president', 'donald', 'trump', 'sign', 'executive', 'order', 'wednesday', 'man', 'woman', 'sport', 'people', 'knowledge', 'signing', 'share', 'daily', 'wire', 'president', 'sign', 'executive', 'action', 'wednesday', 'surround', 'advocate', 'fight', 'gender', 'ideology', 'preservation', 'woman', 'space', 'immediately', 'clear', 'order', 'focus', 'sport', 'collegiate', 'sport', 'broad', 'ban', 'man', 'compete', 'trans', 'identify', 'female', 'woman', 'sport', 'trump', 'long', 'promise', 'ban', 'man', 'identify', 'woman', 'participate', 'female', 'sport', 'cite', 'high', 'profile', 'story', 'riley', 'gaine', 'athlete', 'force', 'compete', 'man', 'identify', 'female', 'swimmer', 'name', 'lia', 'thomas', 'gaine', 'respond', 'request', 'comment', 'address', 'republican', 'study', 'committee', 'gender', 'issue', 'wednesday', 'daily', 'wire', 'report', 'election', 'cycle', 'trump', 'team', 'embrace', 'issue', 'voice', 'concern', 'american', 'parent', 'country', 'daughter', 'private', 'space', 'invade', 'man', 'opportunity', 'take', 'away', 'gender', 'ideology', 'lead', 'election', 'day', 'trump', 'advisor', 'tell', 'daily', 'wire', 'messaging', 'reach', 'woman', 'specifically', 'suburban', 'woman', 'population', 'democrats', 'target', 'aggressive', 'abortion', 'messaging', 'wall', 'street', 'journal', 'predict', 'trans', 'identify', 'male', 'woman', 'sport', 'sleeper', 'issue', 'lia', 'thomas', 'riley', 'gaine', 'photo', 'rich', 'von', 'biberstein', 'icon', 'sportswire', 'getty', 'image', 'campaign', 'trump', 'repeatedly', 'state', 'kamala', 'harris', 'democrats', 'push', 'dangerous', 'ideology', 'americans', 'want', 'argue', 'repeatedly', 'far', 'leave', 'policy', 'democratic', 'party', 'embrace', 'crazy', 'assertion', 'base', 'polling', 'internal', 'external', 'daily', 'wire', 'report', 'show', 'americans', 'want', 'radical', 'transgender', 'policy', 'sickos', 'push', 'sexual', 'content', 'kindergarten', 'provide', 'puberty', 'blocker', 'young', 'child', 'idea', 'puberty', 'blocker', 'say', 'draw', 'laugh', 'crowd', 'way', 'people', 'audience', 'smile', 'trump', 'specifically', 'promise', 'man', 'woman', 'sport', 'message', 'messaging', 'republican', 'candidate', 'country', 'cause', 'major', 'democrat', 'reverse', 'stance', 'man', 'woman', 'sport', 'day', 'ahead', 'election', 'texas', 'alaska', 'pennsylvania', 'wednesday', 'annual', 'national', 'girl', 'woman', 'sport', 'day']",

“it’s already having its intended effect — preventing children from being maimed and sterilized by adults perpetuating a radical, false claim that they can somehow change a child’s sex,” the white house said in a monday release. “hospitals around the country are taking action to downsize or eliminate their so-called ‘gender-affirming care’ programs.”

“president trump will always protect american children,” the white house added. “promises made, promises kept – again.”

in new york, nyu langone health began canceling transgender appointments for children, including two 12-year-olds who were supposed to start puberty blockers — medication that can have irreversible impacts on a child’s development.

in colorado, a spokesperson for denver health told nbc that it had stopped performing transgender surgeries on children and young people under the age of 19.

in virginia, both vcu health and the children’s hospital of richmond confirmed to nbc that they have halted their transgender medication and surgeries on children and people under 19. uva health in charlottesville has suspended all so-called “gender-affirming care” while it reviews the guidance.

“like many health systems across the country, the university of virginia and uva health are working to analyze and interpret the federal order and related state guidance, as well as monitoring other potential policy changes and impacts to ensure we are always delivering care in accordance with the law,” the hospital wrote.

in the nation’s capital, washington, d.c., children’s national hospital “paused prescriptions of puberty blockers and hormone therapy to comply with the directives while we assess the situation further,” according to nbc. the hospital has previously said it doesn’t perform transgender surgeries on children.

in illinois, lurie children’s hospital of chicago said it is reviewing trump’s order and “assessing any potential impact to the clinical services we offer to our patient families,” according to the local outlet fox59. the hospital statement added: “our team will continue to advocate for access to medically necessary care, grounded in science and compassion for the patient-families we are so privileged to serve.”

in pennsylvania, children’s hospital of philadelphia also said it is “closely reviewing recent government actions, including the executive order on jan. 28, to understand how they might impact care for the children who rely on [it].”

trump signed an executive order during his second week in office protecting children from irreversible gender transition procedures, calling them a “stain on our nation’s history.”

the order describes the transgender procedures that doctors and activists have pushed upon children in recent years, and states that the united states will not fund, sponsor, promote, assist, or support the attempted gender transition of a child, promising that it will “rigorously enforce all laws that prohibit or limit these destructive and life-altering procedures.”

“across the country today, medical professionals are maiming and sterilizing a growing number of impressionable children under the radical and false claim that adults can change a child’s sex through a series of irreversible medical interventions,” the order states. “this dangerous trend will be a stain on our nation’s history, and it must end.”

“countless children soon regret that they have been mutilated and begin to grasp the horrifying tragedy that they will never be able to conceive children of their own or nurture their children through breastfeeding,” the order continues. “moreover, these vulnerable youths’ medical bills may rise throughout their lifetimes, as they are often trapped with lifelong medical complications, a losing war with their own bodies, and, tragically, sterilization.”

on friday, white house press secretary karoline leavitt told the daily wire that trump would “certainly” support congressional efforts to protect children from transgender procedures.

“the president has already taken a very strong stance on this issue this week with the signing of his executive order, a few executive orders in this space,” she told the daily wire during friday’s press briefing.

“first, he made it the official policy of the federal government that there are only two sexes, male and female, and we have directed all federal agencies to comply with that policy,” leavitt explained. “as for congressional legislation to support the president’s agenda in this space, and certainly ending the mutilation of young children, the chemical castration of young children, which is a barbaric practice that the vast majority of americans do not support, for young, minor children, certainly, the president would support congress’ efforts, as he has already made that very clear this week.”","['follow', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'executive', 'order', 'protect', 'child', 'irreversible', 'gender', 'procedure', 'hospital', 'country', 'start', 'cancel', 'appointment', 'cease',

significantly, it also describes the “blatant harm” done to children by the flawed guidance from the world professional association for transgender health (wpath), an organization that “lacks scientific integrity,” and tells parents that their children will kill themselves if they do not obtain so-called “gender-affirming care.”

the order refers to wpath as “junk science.”

within 90 days of the executive order’s signing, it states, the secretary of health and human services will publish a review of the existing literature on best practices for promoting the health of kids with gender dysphoria or other identity-based confusion. trump’s order also directs the heads of his agencies to ” immediately take appropriate steps to ensure that institutions receiving federal research or education grants end the chemical and surgical mutilation of children.”

elon musk, the billionaire owner of tesla and spacex, told dr. jordan b. peterson that he was “tricked into” allowing one of his sons to undergo gender procedures, saying his child was “killed” by the “woke mind virus.”

musk sat down with peterson for an interview that covered a range of topics and was streamed live on dailywire+ and x. during one segment, peterson and musk discussed children being targeted by doctors with gender procedures, with both men agreeing that the practice is “evil.” musk called “gender-affirming care,” the left’s description of the procedures, “a terrible euphemism.”

“it’s really child mutilation and sterilization,” musk said. “it’s evil. you’re taking kids who are far below the age of consent.”

“it’s very possible for adults to manipulate children who are having an actual identity crisis into believing that they are the wrong gender,” he added.

“why are you willing to make this an issue?” peterson asked musk, which led to the billionaire entrepreneur opening up about his son, xavier, who struggled with gender dysphoria and now identifies as a girl.

“well, it happened to one of my older boys,” the tesla and spacex owner replied. “i was essentially tricked into signing documents for one of my older boys, xavier. this was really before i had any understanding of what was going on, and we had covid going on, so there was a lot of confusion. and i was told xavier might commit suicide.”



“that was a lie right from the outset,” peterson said. “no reliable clinician ever believed that. there was never any evidence for that, and also, if there is a higher suicide rate, the reason is the underlying depression and anxiety and not because of the gender dysphoria. and every god-d*** clinician knows that, too, and they’re too cowardly to come out and say it.”

“it’s incredibly evil,” musk said. “and i agree with you that the people that are promoting this should go to prison.”

“i was tricked into doing this. it wasn’t explained to me that puberty blockers are actually just sterilization drugs,” he added. “i lost my son, essentially. they call it ‘deadnaming’ for a reason. the reason they call it ‘deadnaming’ is because your son is dead, so my son, xavier, is dead, killed by the woke mind virus.”

“i’m sorry to hear that. i can’t imagine what that would be like,” peterson told the billionaire entrepreneur.

“so i vowed to destroy the woke mind virus after that,” said musk. “and we’re making some progress.”

several religious students challenged the school’s policies prohibiting the “deadnaming” or “misgendering” of transgender students, as well as policies allowing transgender-identifying students to use the bathroom of those of the opposite sex.

america first legal (afl), which argued the case for those students, said in a statement that the judge’s decision amounted to a “ruling that [fairfax county public schools] fcps’ pronoun policy punishing ‘misgendering’ and bathroom policy based on ‘gender identity’ violate students’ constitutional rights.”

in court filings, it said fcps, one of the nation’s largest districts, had made its animus toward christians clear, including that “rather than take the oath of office by swearing on a bible, torah, koran, or other religious text (as is traditional), the current chair of the school board took his oath on gender queer.” (the school board chair, karl frisch, followed hardcore gay pornography on twitter using the same account he used for school board campaigning, and once claimed that “fairfax has a history of being an epicenter for right-wing religious fanaticism.”)

in court, fcps focused on technicalities, saying that because the plaintiffs had not actually been disciplined for misgendering, they had no basis to sue. the plaintiffs’ attorney, ian prior, argued in court that they had engaged in “self-censorship” by avoiding using pronouns at all, and that a “credible threat of enforcement” was enough to infringe upon their rights.

fcps’s attorney, noah sullivan of the firm gentry locke, replied that self-censorship solved the issue. “their religion does not require them to use pronouns or to talk to people at all,” he said.

he said the same applied to bathrooms: normal girls who didn’t want to encounter a transgender person in a bathroom could simply use single-stall bathrooms. “using a common bathroom is not a tenet of their religion. they can just use a private bathroom,” he said.

prior argued in court, “their purpose is to make christians check their constitutional rights at the door and submit to state-sponsored ideology. … gender expansive’ students may use any bathroom. therefore we’re treating gender nonconforming students more favorably than religious ones,” he said.

in a written filing, sullivan wrote, “petitioners have no right, at school, to refer directly to other students by pronouns those students do not accept. it is inherently disruptive and not protected speech within the school setting.”

the plaintiffs “were pressured to take a test that required them to answer true or false to the following assertion: ‘a student has a right to be called by their chosen name and pronoun.’ ‘true’ was the ‘correct’ answer,” court papers said.

judge brett a kassabian rejected fairfax county public schools’ bid to throw out the portion of the case dealing with pronouns, writing that “the court overrules the demurrer to counts i, ii, ii, and iv.”

in an interview outside of court, prior told the daily wire that the ruling shows that the judge has accepted his theory of the case, and if he proves facts consistent with it at trial, he is likely to prevail.

fcps argued that the original girl who brought the case, who said she was followed into the bathroom by a “gender expansive” male, had since graduated, making the case moot. younger students then joined the case, but fcps argued that they shouldn’t be able to sue on the bathroom issue unless they could show that they had actually shared a bathroom with a transgender person. (the plaintiffs said they have sought out single-stall bathrooms, which has avoided that scenario.)

kassabian said he did not think “generalized anxiety” about using a bathroom knowing that a biological member of the opposite sex could enter was sufficient to show damages, but that the plaintiffs could amend their complaint to address that, and that the girl who graduated could still be owed damages.

prior said, in written arguments, that fcps’s bathroom rule “creates a new class of students—‘transgender and gender-expansive students’—and provides them the right to live their daily life in accordance with their secular views of gender fluidity by giving them unrestricted access to the common restrooms [and] elevates this right over the rights of the petitioners and all other students to live their daily lives in accordance with their faith by denying those students the right to use a common, sex-segregated restroom.”

prior said that fcps replaced “biological gender” with “sex assigned at birth” in its curriculum, and when a member of a curriculum committee objected, it removed her from the committee. “the respondent cannot seriously claim that most mainstream religions do not believe that sex is determined at birth by god. thus, its actions to delegitimize that belief through policy would inevitably have consequences for many, if not most, students at fcps,” he wrote.

the school board cited department of education regulations equating “gender identity” with sex, and said federal law supersedes state law. “all nine [supreme court] justices said those portions that define sex as gender are likely unconstitutional,” prior said, with sullivan countering that “there is no formal judgement, courts can change their minds.”

prior said the same federal regulations that fcps said are the law of the land are likely to soon change. “the reality is that there’s a new administration coming in that interprets title ix in a very different way,” he said.","['fairfax', 'virginia', 'state', 'judge', 'friday', 'reject', 'virginia', 'school', 'system', 'bid', 'stop', 'lawsuit', 'allege', 'transgender', 'policy', 'discriminate',

tennessee gov. bill lee (r.) signed the much-discussed senate bill 1 into law on march 22, 2023, which went into effect on july 1, 2023. the bill bans doctors or health care providers from performing so-called “gender-affirming” surgeries or hormonal procedures on minors, including surgery, puberty blockers, and hormones.

the bill followed a september 2022 investigation into vanderbilt university medical center (vumc) by the the daily wire’s matt walsh, who exposed vumc’s gender transition procedures for children and shocking attitudes towards gender transitions in general. walsh and the daily wire found that the hospital regarded transgender procedures as a “big money maker” and pressured employees to ignore their “religious beliefs” on transgender issues or face “consequences.”

the biden administration joined the aclu and several teenage plaintiffs suing to stop the law, and a tennessee district court initially blocked it in april 2023. but in september 2023, a sixth circuit court upheld tennessee’s protections for children. the supreme court took up the case in june 2024, combining the justice department and aclu cases into united states v. skrmetti, marking the first time that the high court took up a case of this kind.

“the people of tennessee, through their elected representatives, took measured action with senate bill 1 to protect kids from irreversible, unproven medical procedures,” tennessee attorney general jonathan skrmetti said in an october statement. “lawmakers recognized that there is little to no credible evidence to justify the serious risks these procedures present to youth and joined a growing number of european countries in restricting their use on minors with gender-identity issues.”

the aclu led a variety of left-wing legal groups in suing tennessee in april 2023 to block the law from going into effect, calling these transgender procedures “medically necessary gender-affirming care for tennessee’s transgender youth.” that claim is based on activist assertions that young people suffering from gender dysphoria may commit suicide if they do not have access to transgender hormones or surgeries.

recent research has shown that, contrary to such claims, these procedures actually increase the likelihood that minors will attempt suicide. according to an april study, “gender-affirming surgery is significantly associated with elevated suicide-attempt risks, underlining the necessity for comprehensive post-procedure psychiatric support.”

yet the aclu and their allies are suing tennessee on behalf of a nashville, tennessee couple and their 15-year-old son, who identifies as a girl, as well as a doctor from memphis, tennessee, dr. susan lacy.

“it was incredibly painful watching my child struggle before we were able to get her the life-saving healthcare she needed. we have a confident, happy daughter now, who is free to be herself and she is thriving,” the aclu’s client, samantha williams, said earlier this year of her trans-identifying son.

“i am so afraid of what this law will mean for her,” she said. “we don’t want to leave tennessee, but this legislation would force us to either routinely leave our state to get our daughter the medical care she desperately needs or to uproot our entire lives and leave tennessee altogether. no family should have to make this kind of choice.”

skrmetti’s office argues that states have governed the practice of medicine within their borders since the united states was founded, pointing out that it is states who license doctors and regulate medical practices, which includes restricting the administration of drugs. the tennessee lawmakers who passed senate bill 1 used that power to stop the use of hormonal and surgical procedures for minor gender transition procedures, skrmetti’s office said.

more than 20 other states have passed similar laws protecting children, they pointed out.

“the federal government, in its arguments to the supreme court, puts its faith in a false and manufactured consensus that ignores the many doctors, states, and countries who have looked at the evidence and determined these treatments are too risky for kids,” skrmetti added. “the constitution does not prevent the states from regulating the practice of medicine where hot-button social issues are concerned. people who disagree with restrictions on irreversible pediatric procedures for gender transition are free to advocate for change through state elections.”

the aclu’s case will be argued by chase strangio, a woman who identifies as a transgender man. the aclu has advertised that strangio will be the first openly trans-identifying individual to argue a case before the supreme court, describing strangio as “our nation’s leading legal expert on the rights of transgender people, bar none.”","['supreme', 'court', 'december', 'hear', 'oral', 'argument',

the story in question, titled “how a women’s college volleyball team became the center of the transgender athlete debate,” explored the explosion of protests and forfeitures surrounding san jose state university and the school’s star player — a trans-identifying male.

when addressing the issue of eligibility for trans-identifying players under the ncaa’s rules, the nyt published the following:

on its website, the n.c.a.a. says trans volleyball players are eligible to play if their testosterone level is less than 10 nanomoles per liter — that’s at least four times more than what many experts say is the top of the range for non-transgender women, and in the typical range for adult men.

as the article itself notes, the normal testosterone level for an adult male — which would then decrease with age — is 10-35 nanomoles per liter. and that alone could be cause for argument that a trans-identifying player still has a biological advantage over female players.

but after being referred to as “cis” women, “birthing persons,” and “menstruators,” it was the nyt’s phrasing that got the attention of their critics.

“hey @nytimes. don’t call us ‘non-transgender women.’ just stop it. stop all the offensive terms for us: birthing parent; uterus haver; menstruator; vaginal presenting (from the olympus spa hearing). we are women!” women are real posted via x.

2b490240-1fef-48ca-b71f-42c51e791f12,anti,trump's transgender military ban dealt legal blow after appeals court ruling,"['trump', 'transgender', 'military', 'ban', 'deal', 'legal', 'blow', 'appeal', 'court', 'ruling']",fox,breanne deppisch,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trumps-transgender-military-ban-dealt-legal-blow-after-appeals-court-ruling,4/1/2025,"a u.s. appeals court on monday rejected the trump administration’s request to pause a lower court ruling that temporarily blocked its ban on transgender military service members – a near-term blow as the administration signals it may take the case to the supreme court.

the three-judge panel on the 9th circuit court of appeals denied the administration’s request for an administrative stay, which would have allowed it to enforce the ban while a lower court weighs the case.

instead, the appellate court decision leaves in place, for now, a preliminary injunction handed down late last month by u.s. district judge benjamin settle. that decision blocked the trump administration from identifying and removing transgender service members for the near-term while the case proceeds in lower court.

""the department of justice has vigorously defended president trump’s executive actions, including the prioritizing military excellence and readiness executive order, and will continue to do so,"" a spokesperson for the justice department told fox news digital. 

the trump administration has attempted to ban transgender people from serving in the u.s. armed forces, although the move is currently held up in court. (getty images)

the trump administration filed its appeal to the 9th circuit last week, seeking to overturn judge settle's preliminary injunction. 

in court filings, the government argued that the transgender military policy ""furthers the government’s important interests in military readiness, unit cohesion, good order and discipline, and avoiding disproportionate costs.""

however, the policy has already faced a wave of early legal challenges.

settle, who is based in tacoma, washington, is not the only federal judge to block the trump administration’s transgender military ban this year. last month, u.s. district judge ana reyes also temporarily blocked trump's ban, citing what she described as a lack of evidence to support the administration’s stated rationale for the policy.

reyes vehemently contested the government's assertion that being transgender is ""not consistent with the humility and selflessness required of a service member."" 

u.s. district judge ana reyes testifies before the senate judiciary committee on capitol hill, prior to her confirmation to the u.s. district court. (sarah silbiger/reuters)

reyes noted in a scathing, 79-page ruling that transgender service members have provided a combined total of ""over 130 years of military service,"" have been deployed around the globe, including currently in an active combat zone, and together have earned more than 80 commendations and medals for their service. 

the three-judge panel for the u.s. court of appeals for the d.c. circuit broke with reyes's order, however – agreeing to grant the trump administration an administrative stay.

still, the judges stressed that the stay ""should not be construed in any way as a ruling on the merits"" of the case. the panel also said they reserve the right to reconsider the administrative stay if the military is found to have taken adverse action against passenger service members. 

president donald trump ordered the ban in question shortly after taking office in a january executive order. the order states that the ""adoption of a gender identity inconsistent with an individual's sex conflicts with a soldier's commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one's personal life"" – which plaintiffs have vigorously contested.

according to court documents, u.s. judge david nye said in his temporary restraining order that ""preserving the status quo pending a more complete review is the most fitting approach at the current juncture.""

""this is not a full adjudication of any argument on the merits. the court is simply holding s.b. 1100 in abeyance and preserving the situation as it existed prior to the parties’ disagreement,"" nye noted.

""school districts may choose how to organize their bathrooms, changing facilities, and overnight accommodations — whether that is sex-separate or transgender-inclusive; whether it is consistent with what it did last year or not. but the state of idaho will not be mandating that decision at this time.""

the restraining order prevents idaho public schools, which are scheduled to reopen for the school year aug. 16, from enforcing gender-separation rules in its bathrooms.

in july, the idaho state legislature enacted senate bill 1100, which forbids individuals from using public school restrooms and changing facilities that do not align with their sex as recorded at birth. additionally, students have the right to sue their peers for up to $5,000 if they witness them using restrooms that do not correspond to their birth-assigned sex.

the injunction comes as a seventh-grade student, who identifies as transgender, joined by the school group boise high school’s sexuality and gender alliance, sued the state last month arguing sb 1100 violates the student's privacy and discriminates against gender.

""the purpose of house bill 1837 is to protect our girls and young women from being forced to compete against biological males,"" delegate karen greenhalgh (r-virginia beach) said. ""similarly gifted and trained males will always have the physical advantage over females, which is the reason we have women’s sports.""

a virginia house of delegates subcommittee voted along party lines to move house bill 1387 to the full education committee. the controversial bill, patroned by greenhalgh, would ban transgender women and girls from competing on any ""interscholastic, intercollegiate, intramural, or club athletic team"" at any school or college in the state.

""even the strongest, fastest girls in virginia must step up to the starting line and know, ‘i can’t win,'"" said greenhalgh. ""their goals are gone, their chance at winning and recognition and scholarship, it’s just not fair for women to lose these opportunities.""

house bill 1387, sponsored by virginia beach delegate karen greenhalgh would specifically focus on varsity-sanctioned athletics, intramural & club sports grades kindergarten through 12th grade, and public colleges and universities. (fox 5)

the legislation would require transgender athletes in the commonwealth to compete in sports aligned with their biological sex. if passed, the law would apply to all athletes from kindergarten through 12th grade, at public colleges and universities, as well as intercollegiate, interscholastic and club sports.

under current virginia high school league (vhsl) regulations, transgender athletes wishing to have their identity recognized for competition must provide documentation of their transition, including lists of medication taken. the decision is then left to a vhsl district committee to be made on a case-by-case basis.

since these rules were enacted in 2014, 28 transgender students have applied and 25 have been granted the right to play on teams aligning with their gender identities. 

republicans currently control the virginia house of delegates by a 51-47 margin; however, democrats have a 22-18 majority in the state senate, making the bill's fate beyond the virginia house uncertain.

transgender individuals face ""heightened psychological distress,"" including depression, anxiety and suicidal ideation, ""partly due to stigma and lack of gender affirmation,"" as stated in the study, which was published in the journal of sexual medicine.

researchers from the university of texas set out to determine the mental health impacts from transgender people who underwent ""gender-affirming surgery.""

the study focused on 107,583 patients 18 and over with gender dysphoria, some who underwent surgery and others who did not.

    depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation and substance-use disorders were ""significantly higher"" among those who underwent surgery.

the same differences were seen among females, as those with surgery had 22.9% depression rates compared to 14.6% in the non-surgical group.

females who underwent surgery also had anxiety rates of 10.5% compared to 7.1% without surgery.

the study focused on 107,583 patients 18 and over with gender dysphoria, some who underwent surgery and others who did not. (istock)

surgeries that aimed to ""feminize individuals"" showed ""particularly high"" rates of depression and substance abuse two years after the procedures, the study found.

""findings suggest the necessity for gender-sensitive mental health support following gender-affirming surgery to address post-surgical psychological risks,"" the researchers wrote.
‘not a cure-all’

jonathan alpert, a manhattan-based psychotherapist and author, said the study findings highlight the ""often overlooked"" psychological risks that accompany gender-affirming surgery.

""while these surgeries can be critical in helping individuals align their physical appearance with their gender identity, they are not a cure-all for the mental health challenges many transgender individuals face,"" alpert, who was not involved in the study, told fox news digital.

""these findings suggest that surgery alone doesn’t eliminate the complex psychological burdens that stem from societal stigma and personal struggles with identity,"" he went on.

""in fact, taking a scalpel to treat a psychological disorder can sometimes lead to more issues, as the study results are elucidating.""

""this isn’t about politics and ideology — it’s about health, longevity, and making sure people don’t undergo drastic, life-altering procedures only to regret them."" (istock)

florida neurosurgeon dr. brett osborn, who also was not part of the study, agreed that ""surgery is no guarantee of happiness.""

""we’re often told that gender-affirming surgery is essential for alleviating gender dysphoria — but what happens when the euphoria fades?"" he said in an interview with fox news digital.

""the key question remains: is the surgery itself causing distress, or are preexisting mental health issues driving people toward it? correlation or causation? no one knows.""
potential causes of gender dysphoria

a 2022 study showed that around 1.4 million american adults identify as transgender and about 0.6% of all american adults experience gender dysphoria.

""the dramatic upward trend of gender dysphoria among young people in recent years should raise serious questions about the role of cultural and social influences,"" alpert said.

""while increased awareness has made it easier for some children to express their struggles, we cannot ignore the possibility that social contagion, along with peer influence and social media, may be contributing to this surge.""

one doctor also cautioned against sexual hormone therapy — ""we’re talking about irreversible changes that demand lifelong management."" (adobe stock )

both experts caution against rushing into surgery or other irreversible decisions.

teens who are being treated for gender dysphoria should be ""properly supported and treated with compassion"" without being pressured into making ""life-altering"" medical decisions, alpert advised.

    ""you don’t amputate a limb because of temporary pain, and you certainly don’t permanently alter your body without exhausting every other option first.""

osborn also stressed the need for comprehensive psychological evaluations, especially for those with preexisting mental health challenges. mental health support, lifestyle modifications and counseling should all take precedence before surgery, not after, he said.

""you don’t amputate a limb because of temporary pain, and you certainly don’t permanently alter your body without exhausting every other option first,"" he said.

""that said, to a great degree, the burden is on us physicians who took an oath to first do no harm.""

mark trammell, executive director of the center for american liberty, which provides legal representation to people who are de-transitioning after trans surgeries, provided the below statement to fox news digital.

    ""surgery alone doesn’t eliminate the complex psychological burdens that stem from societal stigma and personal struggles with identity.""

""the findings of this study should serve as a wake-up call. but for the young detransitioners we represent in lawsuits against gender clinics, these statistics are their lived reality,"" he said.

""their so-called 'gender-affirming care' did not alleviate their distress — it created new mental health struggles and, for many, introduced suicidal thoughts for the first time. this is why we are fighting to hold those responsible accountable.""

b36c40dd-d8d8-4378-bd66-c586c3c8f664,anti,maine girl involved in trans athlete battle reveals how state's policies hurt her childhood and sports career,"['maine', 'girl', 'involve', 'trans', 'athlete', 'battle', 'reveal', 'state', 'policy', 'hurt', 'childhood', 'sport', 'career']",fox,jackson thompson,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/maine-girl-fighting-trans-athlete-battle-reveals-how-policies-impacted-her-childhood-sports-career,3/22/2025,"cassidy carlisle was in seventh grade when she had to change in the same locker room as a transgender student, she said. 

during a gym class at presque isle middle school in northern maine six years ago, she said she walked into the locker room to find a biological male who would change with her and other girls. she alleges she was told by administrators that if she tried to avoid changing with the trans student, she would risk being late to class. 

""that was really my first experience in just knowing that something isn't right, but not knowing what to do with that,"" carlisle told fox news digital in an exclusive interview. fox news digital has reached out to presque isle middle school for comment.

gender identity was first included in the maine human rights act as part of the definition of sexual orientation in 2005. in 2021, the law was amended to add gender identity as its own protected class, joining other protected classes such as sex, sexual orientation, disability, race, color and religion. the law specifically says that denying a person equal opportunity in athletic programs is education discrimination.

but for carlisle, the transgender student in her gym class was only in the girls locker room for about a week, before mysteriously vanishing, carlisle claims. but the memory of the experience still stuck with her. 
cassidy skiing

the memory especially stuck with her in her junior year of high school, when she found out she would be competing with a trans athlete on the state nordic skiing team. 

it was an athlete with whom she was familiar. she had already lost to the trans athlete in cross-country competitions in previous years.

when her father told her she would have to face the athlete again in skiing, carlisle didn't believe it was happening. 

""i was like, ‘oh, that’s only something i kind of hear about on the news. … it’s not going to happen to me,"" cassidy recalled.

but it did happen to her.

""the defeat that comes with that in that moment is heartbreaking,"" carlisle said. ""i'm just in shock in a way. i didn't believe it. … i didn't think it was happening to me.""

as a child, carlisle quit her co-ed hockey team specifically because she felt she ""couldn't keep up"" with the boys. then, even after committing to a girls-only sport, she couldn't escape the physical disadvantage that came with facing biological males. 

on top of the anxiety of the situation, carlisle felt like she couldn't speak out about it. 

""i stayed silent for a while,"" carlisle said. ""it's very hard to speak up if you don't have a platform to do it on. … backlash is a huge thing. i'm a high school student. no high school student wants to be hurt or yelled at or said mean comments by people. and the reality of it, with the state that i live in, that could very much happen."" 

what she could do was vote in the november election. as a first-time voter, she cast her ballot with the issue of trans athletes in girls sports at the forefront.
trump, maine gov. janet mills clash over executive order compliance video

a national exit poll conducted by the concerned women for america legislative action committee found that 70% of moderate voters saw the issue of ""donald trump’s opposition to transgender boys and men playing girls and women’s sports and of transgender boys and men using girls and women’s bathrooms"" as important to them. 

and 6% said it was the most important issue of all, while 44% said it was ""very important.""

but then when republican maine state rep. laurel libby spoke out against another trans athlete who won a girls pole vault competition in february, carlisle suddenly had an opportunity to influence the issue more directly.  

libby's social media post identifying the trans athlete thrust the entire state into an ongoing culture war. it became ground zero for a national battle over the issue waged by the trump administration against several democrat-controlled states like maine after trump signed an executive order to address the issue feb. 5. 

all of a sudden, thousands of people in maine were speaking out against the state's laws that enable trans inclusion in girls sports and locker rooms, all with the backing of the president. 

so carlisle joined in. 
ag bondi holds white house roundtable on preserving women’s sports video

on feb. 27, carlisle made a trip to the white house with several other current and former female athletes who have been affected by trans inclusion, including payton mcnabb and selina soule. there, they met with attorney general pam bondi and several other state attorneys general and shared their stories. 

carlisle couldn't help but notice an absence at the white house that day, 

""none of our ags were there from our state,"" carlisle said. 

so, when carlisle returned to her state, she took matters into her own hands. 

last weekend, she delivered a speech in front of the maine capitol, speaking to hundreds of other residents there to protest gov. janet mills for her continued enabling of trans athletes in girls sports. 

it was the second protest against mills outside the capitol in a month after the march on mills rally march 1. 

the trump administration is taking aggressive measures to get the state to adhere to the wishes of carlisle and other residents who want females protected from trans inclusion. 

on march 17, the health and human services office of civil rights (ocr) announced that if found the maine department of education, the maine principals' association and greely high school in violation of title ix for continuing to enable trans inclusion in girls sports. 

in the announcement, the department said maine had 10 days to correct its policies through a signed agreement or risk referral to the u.s. department of justice for appropriate action.

trump has already shown a willingness to cut federal funding to enforce these policies. he paused $175 million in funding to the university of pennsylvania and temporarily paused funding to the university of maine system last week until a review had found the system was in full compliance with trump's orders. 

the deadline for the rest of maine to comply is coming up within the week. 

""i really hope that maine complies because our schools need the federal funding, and we can't risk losing that,"" carlisle said. ""it would really really hurt our state to lose that federal funding. so, i hope our government can get it together.""","['cassidy', 'carlisle', 'seventh', 'grade', 'change', 'locker', 'room',

the spartans will compete in las vegas for the mountain west tournament, and all eyes will be on senior blaire fleming. fleming's participation in the tournament this week was in question after an emergency hearing in colorado, when plaintiffs, including fleming's teammate brooke slusser, contested that fleming should be excluded from this year's tournament on the basis of being a biological male. 

however, fleming is in the clear after a federal judge ruled that the athlete will be allowed to play. with fleming on the court, the tournament is bound to be at the center of national political discourse over the consequences of trans inclusion in women's sports. 

the situation involving fleming and slusser became a national scandal, highlighting an issue that became a deep vulnerability for democrat candidates leading up to the november election.

the story of slusser, fleming and the discourse that rippled throughout the country will come to a head in las vegas. here is how it got there. 

president biden, hours after assuming office, issued an executive order on ""preventing and combating discrimination on the basis of gender identity or sexual orientation."" (ap photo/susan walsh)

on jan. 20, 2021, just hours after president biden assumed office, he issued an executive order on ""preventing and combating discrimination on the basis of gender identity or sexual orientation."" 

this order included a section that read, ""children should be able to learn without worrying about whether they will be denied access to the restroom, the locker room, or school sports."" 

it was just the first in many steps taken by the biden administration and democrat lawmakers at the congressional and state level that enabled a sudden wave of trans athletes to compete as girls and women in the u.s. during the current president's term. 

it set a clear precedent for biden's entire party on what the baseline stance on trans inclusion in girls' and women's sports would be. 
summer 2022

fleming came to the bay area as a transfer ahead of the 2022 season. fleming, a virginia native, transferred from coastal carolina as one of the top players in the transfer portal. fleming previously set a single-game record at john champe high school with 30 kills in a match in 2019 and a single-season record of 266 kills for the school's girls' volleyball team. 

footage from the athlete's hudl page of the school-record 30-kill match in september 2019 shows how hard and fast fleming's spikes came down at the high school level against girl opponents.

according to testimony by former san jose state assistant coach melissa batie-smoose in a lawsuit against the university and the mountain west, fleming was given a full scholarship. the lawsuit alleges coaches and the athletic department were aware fleming was a biological male. 

meanwhile, fleming's arrival on the team, and alleged natural ability to spike the ball harder than the other players, may have ended up costing a female player a spot and a scholarship. former san jose state volleyball player alyssa sugai, who is part of the lawsuit and joined the team as a walk-on in 2021, alleges she declined offers to transfer to another school to stay at san jose state for the 2022 season and potentially earn a scholarship. 
spring 2023

in april 2023, the biden administration proposed a plan to forbid outright bans on transgender athletes. the outline of the plan outraged conservatives who labeled it as a ploy to enable trans inclusion in women's sports. however, some on the left thought the plan was actually too right-leaning.

supporters of the plan argued that it would provide framework for schools and universities to put rules in place to restrict trans inclusion legally. certain democrats, including new york rep. alexandra ocasio-cortez, labeled the plan as ""indefensible and embarrassing,"" in a post on x for not being pro-trans enough. 

it was one of the first signs that there was a broad range in the spectrum of beliefs on the issue of trans inclusion in women's sports within the democratic party, and a sign that more infighting would be coming. 
summer 2023

slusser came to san jose state one year later as a transfer out of alabama. slusser, a texas native, was on a full scholarship, just like fleming. 

slusser's very first residence at the university was shared with fleming, her lawsuit alleged. slusser also alleged that no one at any point ever indicated to her that fleming was a biological male, despite the fact that head coach todd kress and others at the university were aware of it.

""due to her personal convictions and religious beliefs, slusser would not have roomed with fleming or changed clothes in front of fleming if slusser had known fleming was male,"" the court documents read. 

""slusser’s right to protect her bodily privacy was violated by sjsu, kress, and the mwc through actions, policies and practices that caused her to lose her right to bodily privacy without consent and against her will.""
fall 2023

slusser and fleming's first season together at san jose state saw them share rooms together frequently, and the lawsuit alleges it was because fleming requested it. 

""slusser did learn however that the reason she had been assigned to room with fleming so often during road trips in the 2023 season was that kress and other sjsu women’s volleyball officials asked fleming who fleming wanted to room with, and fleming chose slusser,"" the court documents read. 

meanwhile, on the court, the team struggled to a 13-18 record and did not even qualify for the mountain west tournament.

then, near the very end of the disappointing season, slusser learned the truth. the lawsuit claims slusser overheard a conversation between two san jose state students, who were not on the volleyball team, in which they referred to fleming as ""a guy,"" the court documents state. the students then told slusser that her teammate who she had slept in the same room with and undressed in front of was ""a dude."" 

slusser says she did not even know what to do with this information when she found out, but it all made sense to her when she thought about how high fleming could jump and how hard fleming could spike the volleyball. 

however, slusser just sat on the information and did not rush to any conclusions at the time. 
spring 2024

things changed in april 2024 for san jose state's team and the country. that month, the biden administration passed a sweeping title ix re-write that sought to protect trans inclusion and protection in schools. 

the administration issued a sweeping rule that clarified that title ix’s ban on ""sex"" discrimination in schools covers discrimination based on gender identity, sexual orientation and ""pregnancy or related conditions,"" in april. the administration insisted the regulation does not address athletic eligibility. however, multiple experts presented evidence to fox news digital in june that it would ultimately put more biological men in women's sports. 

that same month, an online news article focused on fleming prompted slusser to finally confront her teammate about what she had heard the previous semester, per court documents. 

the day the article was published, slusser came back to her apartment, and fleming and another student asked if slusser would join them for ice cream. it was there fleming revealed to slusser the nature of fleming's birth gender. 

""slusser asked why fleming had not shared this information with her before, particularly as they had been living together. fleming responded that there never seemed to be a good time to bring it up, and that he had been afraid that slusser might not be his friend if slusser knew the truth. fleming also said that if slusser was uncomfortable with it that fleming would leave the volleyball team,"" the documents read.

""slusser was uncomfortable with fleming continuing on the sjsu team as she questioned whether it was safe or fair for the other women on the team and for opposing teams for fleming to compete on the women’s team.""

a team meeting was held days later. it included kress and other university officials. the lawsuit alleges that in that meeting, players were told not to speak about fleming's birth sex publicly. 

""criticism of fleming or his participation on the sjsu team would indicate bigotry and harm their reputation and could subject them to discipline or loss of their scholarship and could be considered a violation of school policies or state law,"" the documents read. 
august 2024

the biden administration's sweeping push to enable trans inclusion in women's and girls' sports saw its heaviest wave of resistance yet in august. 

on aug. 16, the supreme court voted 5-4 to reject a biden administration emergency request to enforce its sweeping title ix reforms in states that filed lawsuits or passed state laws in protest of it. 

the request would have permitted biological men in women’s bathrooms, locker rooms and dorms in 10 states where there are state-level and local-level rules in place to prevent it. 

however, the supreme court's ruling struck a blow to the administration's national authority on the issue. news of the ruling was widely celebrated in conservative circles and brought more of a mainstream focus onto the issue on a national scale. 

the issue garnered so much attention nationally, that even in states where there were no major incidents of it happening, laws were passed to make sure it would not happen. idaho was one of those states, when gov. brad little passed an executive order to enforce the ""defending women's sports act"" in his state. little told fox news digital in an exclusive interview that there were no incidents of trans inclusion in women's sports that prompted the order, but it was rather the influence of former ncaa swimmer and outkick contributor riley gaines. 

little cited gaines as the most influential figure in his decision to pass the order.

gaines, an ascendent conservative influencer, became a lightning rod, drawing attention to the issue of trans inclusion in women's sports amid her ongoing lawsuit against the ncaa. gaines' experience sharing a locker room and competing against lia thomas at the 2022 ncaa championships made her that lightning rod. 

gaines then lent her influence to trump and republicans on the campaign trail. gaines spoke at a former president donald trump rally in arizona on aug. 23, as trump began to cement the agenda of protecting women's sports as a pillar of his campaign messaging amid democratic dysfunction on the issue. 

gaines' influence, along with the others who joined her in the lawsuit against the ncaa, planted the seeds for a widespread woman-first counterculture movement against the biden administration and democrats over the enabling of biological men in women's sports. 

on the last weekend of august, fleming, slusser and their san jose state teammates kicked off their 2024 season at the cal fulerton invitational in fullerton, california. their first opponent of the season, louisiana tech, took the court against fleming without knowing about the biological gender of the player. 

louisiana tech head volleyball coach amber mccray confirmed to fox news digital that her team did not know about the situation involving fleming's natural birth sex, and they did not find out until the day after the match via rumors from parents. 

la tech athletic director ryan ivey suggested that if they had known fleming's natural birth sex, the team ""would have sought ""a different outcome,"" in emails obtained by fox news digital.

it was not long before the spartans' next opponents caught on to what was going on with fleming. eventually, one of the programs decided to do something about it. 

southern utah's volleyball team became the first team to forfeit its match against san jose state on sept. 14. 

armed police protection was assigned to the team starting with a match on sept. 19 and has been present at every game since. as the media attention only got more intense, the school had to commission the help of police departments in other states for the team's away games. 

on sept. 23, slusser made the consequential decision to join gaines and the independent council on women's sports (icons) in their lawsuit against the ncaa, citing her experience with fleming and san jose state. 

slusser joining the lawsuit amplified the scale of the national controversy for san jose state. a university spokesperson, in liaison with the police department, confirmed to fox news digital that the volleyball team was told it would be getting added security of some kind after its first cancelation by southern utah. 

soon, more teams followed southern utah's lead, as boise state, wyoming and utah state all announced forfeits to san jose state that same month. each forfeit only amplified the national controversy surrounding the team, and it quickly entered the political conversation.

gov. little, utah gov. spencer cox and wyoming gov. mark gordon, all republicans, praised the universities and volleyball teams in their respective states who refused to face san jose state in public statements. 

after a 9-0 start to the season, and by virtue of the forfeits, san jose state secured its 12th win without even having to play in that many games by the end of september. 

the growing nationwide cultural movement to defend women's sports grew in september, as certain logos and merchandise started to become more easily synonymous with the movement. parents in new hampshire were banned from a girls' soccer game that included a trans athlete for wearing armbands that read ""xx"" in reference to the natural female chromosomes. 

the incident and a subsequent lawsuit ultimately proved to be a fruitful publicity stunt for the movement and sports clothing brand xx-xy athletics, founded by former gymnast jennifer sey. the brand, tied to the activism of protecting women's sports, just launched earlier this year and saw a surge in popularity when it landed slusser as a sponsor. 

the movement to oppose trans inclusion in women's sports officially became a lucrative business with organic marketing, all in the midst of a heated election year.
october 2024

san jose state's first volleyball game of october was overshadowed by fear of slusser's physical well-being. slusser previously told fox news digital that the night before her team's game against colorado state on oct. 3, her teammate received a message warning that teammate to keep her distance from slusser during the game, because ""something bad"" was going to happen to slusser. 

additional police security was assigned to the event, as multiple officers patrolled the floor that night.

afterward, slusser said she was made aware of an alleged plot involving fleming and colorado state player malaya jones that aimed to have jones spike a ball into slusser's face during the match. these allegations were included in an eventual title ix complaint by batie-smoose against san jose state and the lawsuit filed by slusser and batie-smoose. 

the university has denied these allegations, and a mountain west investigation into the incident concluded that there was insufficient evidence to substantiate the claims. 

still, it was a point of frustration for slusser, she said, watching the university go out of its way to protect fleming. still, the team continued to play together. videos of fleming's spikes hitting opposing players went viral after multiple matches. 

trump himself weighed in on the situation involving fleming during a town hall event on the fox news channel’s ""the faulkner focus"" on oct. 17. trump addressed fleming directly, referencing a video where one of the athlete's spikes was seen hitting the body of another player. 

""i saw the slam, it was a slam. i never saw a ball hit so hard, hit the girl in the head,"" trump said. ""but other people, even in volleyball, they’ve been permanently, i mean, they’ve been really hurt badly. women playing men. but you don’t have to do the volleyball. we stop it. we stop it. we absolutely stop it. you can’t have it."" 

trump used the situation as a springboard to reveal his intention to ban trans inclusion in women's sports entirely if elected. it became a talking point he made sure to reference at every rally from then until election day, as he and republican allies hammered the democrats on their growing-unpopular position of protecting trans inclusion. 

eventually, some democrats had to back off from their previous positions supporting it. texas rep. collin allred had to release ads disavowing his past support for allowing ""boys in girls sports"" in a race to challenge sen. ted cruz for his senate seat in texas. 

vice president kamala harris hardly ever addressed the issue during her campaign and sidestepped questions about her past positions trans inclusion in various interviews. trump just kept hammering the issue more and more at every rally and in various campaign ads that repeated the phrase ""kamala harris is for they/them, donald trump is for you.""

the consequences of democrat-passed laws that protect trans inclusion came under scrutiny leading up to a scheduled volleyball match between san jose state and nevada on oct. 26. leading up to that game, players on nevada's team approached the athletic department and expressed their desire to forfeit the match. however, the university did not honor those wishes initially. 

a nevada spokesperson told fox news digital that the university could not forfeit the match because it would be a violation of an amendment to nevada's constitution. a 2022 amendment, passed by democrats, established parameters that prohibited trans discrimination, and the university deemed that forfeiting a match over a trans player would violate that law.

players came forward publicly condemning the university, garnering the praise and attention of tulsi gabbard along the way. 

the situation involving the nevada players speaking out against their university and the ncaa over being pressured to face san jose state became a national controversy on its own just weeks before the election, in a key battleground state. 

eventually, nevada forfeited the match the day before the game after it concluded that it would not have enough players to compete. 

the nevada players had prevailed as the country watched a movement that was being driven and powered by the passion and defiance of young women. 
november 2024

batie-smoose was suspended from san jose state's coaching staff on nov. 2, the same day as the team's game against new mexico. batie-smoose's suspension came after she filed a title ix complaint that alleged the university was favoring fleming over slusser throughout the situation and alleging fleming's plot to have slusser hit by a spike during the oct. 3 colorado state game. 

slusser told fox news digital on november 3 that news of batie-smoose's suspension caused players in the locker room to cry, and left them feeling ""unsafe.""

slusser also officially came out in support of trump's proposed ban, calling it necessary and adding that she would not trust democrats to handle the situation. 

""i think it's completely necessary,"" slusser said of trump's proposed ban. ""we could trust a lot more that if trump was elected things would be handled in the right way that we want them to be.""

the topic of slusser's team and transgender volleyball players as a whole became a sudden talking point at every trump rally and on major cable news talk shows leading up to the election, as democrats failed to deliver a unified message on the topic. 

trump won the election in a landslide, as republicans also took control of the senate and house of representatives. 

the aftermath of the democrats' crushing defeat caused many of its figures and media pundits to point the finger at trans inclusion as one of the biggest issues that lost them the election. hbo host bill maher has devoted ample air time on his weekly show to lambasting democrats for defending trans inclusion in women's sports and criticizing any in the party who still stand behind it, in the weeks following the election. 

on nov. 7, the new york times published a story that quoted democratic reps. seth moulton of massachusetts and tom suozzi of new york, and each spoke out against trans inclusion and their party for championing it over the last several years. 

other democrats, like ocasio-cortez and newly-elected transgender rep.-elect sarah mcbride, are still firmly in favor of far-left policies to defend trans athletes that want to compete against women, leaving the party with an unresolved divide going forward. 

biden-appointed federal judge kato crews in colorado was the latest figure with democrat ties to enable trans inclusion in women's sports, when he ruled that fleming would be eligible to play in the upcoming mountain west tournament after an emergency hearing by icons and utah state to have fleming disqualified from competing. 

now, the country will get to watch the product of that ruling, combined with laws in california that protect trans inclusion in women's sports, that have allowed fleming to take the court with a conference title on the line in las vegas. 

san jose state is guaranteed to play either boise state or utah state in the semifinal round. both teams have already refused to face fleming and the spartans in the regular season.","['san', 'jose',

the university provided a statement to fox news digital in which it expressed ""respect"" for the recent wave of players who have opted to transfer. ""student athletes have the ability to make decisions about their college athletic careers, and we have the utmost respect for that,"" the statement read.

the san francisco chronicle reported that seven of the team's players have entered the transfer portal.

the seven players who are transferring will be leaving the team after a season that included eight forfeited matches, regular police protection, national scrutiny and internal turmoil between players and coaches. one player even received threats of physical harm amid the controversy.

head coach todd kress even spoke about how the 2024 season was one of the ""most difficult"" of his life after the team's loss in the conference final to colorado state, in a statement provided to fox news digital. 

""this has been one of the most difficult seasons i’ve ever experienced, and i know this is true as well for many of our players and the staff who have been supporting us all along. maintaining our focus on the court and ensuring the overall safety and well-being of my players amid the external noise have been my priorities,"" kress said. 

the transgender player, blaire fleming, is out of eligibility after completing a fourth collegiate season in 2024. the team's season ended in the mountain west conference championship game after it advanced to the title game by virtue of a forfeit from boise state in the semifinal round. boise state previously forfeited two regular season games to san jose state amid the controversy involving fleming, accounting for three of its seven conference wins via forfeit this year. 

a loss to colorado state in the conference final ended the season and prevented the controversy from slipping into the ncaa tournament. the loss effectively ended fleming's collegiate career.

in september, co-captain brooke slusser joined a lawsuit against the ncaa alleging the program withheld knowledge about fleming's birth gender from her and other players on the team. slusser alleged she was made to share changing and sleeping spaces with fleming without knowing that fleming was a biological male. 

slusser, along with several other players in the mountain west, filed a separate lawsuit against the conference and san jose state in november over fleming's presence. that lawsuit included testimony from former san jose state volleyball players alyssa sugai and elle patterson alleging they were passed over for scholarships in favor of fleming. 

that lawsuit also alleges that san jose state players spoke up about an alleged scheme by fleming to have slusser spiked in the face with a volleyball in a game against colorado state on oct. 3. slusser was not spiked in the face in that game, and an investigation by the mountain west concluded without finding sufficient evidence of the alleged plot.

assistant coach melissa batie-smoose was suspended by the program in early november after she filed a title ix complaint against the university for showing favoritism toward fleming over the other players, especially slusser. batie-smoose's complaint also included allegations of fleming's plot to have slusser spiked in the face. 

slusser previously told fox news digital that batie-smoose's dismissal severely impacted the morale of the team.

""after we found out that she was released, a lot of the team just kind of broke down and was kind of freaking out, and even one of my teammates was like, ‘i don’t feel safe anymore,' because there's no one now that we feel like we can go and talk to about our concerns or our actual feelings and can actually speak freely in front of,"" slusser said.

slusser added that she and other players lost trust in the coaches, including head coach kress. 

""you can't truly voice how you're feeling without them just trying to cover it up or act like it's all ok. with melissa, you could voice how you felt, and she could comfort you and validate your feelings and at least make you feel heard compared to the other coaches,"" slusser said.

kress also blamed the team that forfeited for igniting backlash against his team, as each forfeit brought about more controversy and media attention.

""sadly, others who for years have played this same team without incident chose not to play us this season. to be clear, we did not celebrate a single win by forfeiture. instead, we braced for the fallout. each forfeiture announcement unleashed appalling, hateful messages individuals chose to send directly to our student-athletes, our coaching staff and many associated with our program."" 

however, these issues did not stop the players from at least having some fun on what was their final road trip as san jose state spartans for most of them. 

slusser previously told fox news digital that the team went out to a magic show together when they traveled to las vegas for the mountain west tournament, and even had a team thanksgiving meal together at the team hotel with takeout from a local diner with many of their families. 

however, that was not enough to keep the seven players who have entered the transfer portal attached to the program, as the team will be facing a major roster turnover as it looks to rebound on the court and in its reputation in 2025.","['san', 'jose', 'state', 'university', 'acknowledge', 'recent', 'mass', 'exodus', 'volleyball', 'player', 'enter', 'transfer', 'portal', 'controversy',

7800b0b4-57fc-41da-8b7a-10328b577fc7,anti,parents rail against nj school district's 'woke' transgender curriculum: 'can we just get back to teaching?',"['parent', 'rail', 'nj', 'school', 'district', 'woke', 'transgender', 'curriculum', 'teaching']",fox,landon milon,https://www.foxnews.com/us/parents-rail-against-nj-school-districts-woke-transgender-curriculum-can-we-just-get-back-teaching,11/16/2022,"parents and parental rights groups are outraged at a school district in new jersey over its curriculum on gender identity and are accusing the district of encouraging students to transition.

lawrence township public schools adopted a transgender policy for the current school year like the 600 other districts in new jersey. policy 5756 was initially adopted in 2016 and revised three years later. the policy is believed by the district to be mandated by the state, but a clarification issued in april by new jersey's education department says the state ""does not mandate curriculum.""

""i'm tired of people hiding behind [state learning standards] as an excuse to teach this far-left agenda, this woke agenda, this agenda that includes gender theory and all this other stuff that confuses our kids,"" parent robert pluta, who pulled his children out of the district, told fox news digital.

lesson plans, books and assignments on gender identity are part of the district's curriculum.

""this super woke progressive agenda … it's so saturated with race and sex. and it's just like, can we just get back to teaching? i don't want a conservative school, i don't want a liberal school,"" pluta said.

the picture book ""jacob’s new dress"" by ian hoffman and sarah hoffman, which is read to kindergartners, tells the story of a young boy who likes playing dress-up and wants to wear a dress to school, even as his classmates tell him that he cannot wear ""girl"" clothes. kindergartners also are read ""my princess boy"" by cheryl kilodavis, which follows a boy who likes ""pretty things"" and prefers to wear tiaras and ""girly dresses.""

second-graders are read ""10,000 dresses"" by marcus ewert, which features a biological boy named bailey who dreams of wearing extravagant dresses, and ""red"" by michael hall, a story that details how a blue crayon with a red label is facing an identity crisis because the color he identifies as on the inside is not what is seen on his label.

and fifth graders are told the story of ""pride: the story of harvey milk and the rainbow flag"" by rob sanders. harvey milk was the first openly gay man to be elected to public office in california.

another parent, who also lives in the district and pulled her children from the public school system over a gender identity curriculum, cited a lesson on the ""gender snowperson"" taught to fourth-grade students, who are asked to think of themselves as a ""snowperson"" and play a game where they can choose their gender.

""my main concern is that they're pushing social transition. the curricula and the policy really promote, they really encourage children to consider social transition,"" the parent, who wished to remain anonymous, told fox news digital.

the parent also explained that there are four steps in gender transition: social transition, puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones and sex reassignment surgery. she said the district defends itself by noting that it does not administer puberty blockers nor use other medical methods of gender transitioning.

""once you've led the horse to water, the horse is going to drink,"" she said. ""that is what a lot of parents are so concerned about, that they're actually encouraging it.""

at lawrence township, there is a ""social justice"" unit under the social studies curriculum on ""identity/true self,"" which is taught to students as early as kindergarten. 

fifth graders in this unit are taught that ""one of the first steps that all people — adults or children — take, if they feel their internal sense of gender and their sex assigned at birth do not match, is to socially transition.""

""this means adults and children live their lives in a way that expresses their internal sense of who they are — their gender identity,"" the unit description states. ""a person may use a new name and/or different pronouns than before. some might change their gender expression — wear different clothes or have a new hairstyle. students usually want to — and have the right to — use facilities or join school activities that align with their gender identity.""

erika sanzi, the director of outreach for nonprofit parent group parents defending education, told fox news digital the curriculum is ""completely inappropriate for elementary schoolers.""

""it is based in gender ideology and is no different than a teacher choosing to read from the catechism and telling students everything in it is true,"" she said. ""perhaps instead of indoctrinating 5-year-olds and 8-year-olds, they could focus on activism-free reading instruction.""

other social studies units taught to young school children include ""skin color,"" ""bias/prejudice"" and ""being an ally/protest.""

according to the district's transgender policy, the new jersey law against discrimination ""generally makes it unlawful for schools to subject individuals to differential treatment based on gender identity or expression.""

the policy also states that the district ""shall accept a student’s asserted gender identity"" and that ""parental consent is not required.""

""a student need not meet any threshold diagnosis or treatment requirements to have his or her gender identity recognized and respected by the school district, school or school staff members,"" the policy states. ""in addition, a legal or court-ordered name change is not required. there is no affirmative duty for any school district staff member to notify a student’s parent of the student’s gender identity or expression.""

the lawrence township public schools' transgender policy was adopted for the current school year along with the 600 other districts in new jersey. policy 5756 was initially adopted in 2016 and revised three years later. (getty images )

new jersey learning standards explain that a board of education ""shall include instruction on the political, economic and social contributions of persons with disabilities and lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people, in an appropriate place in the curriculum of middle school and high school students as part of the district’s implementation"" of the state's learning standards.

parents have previously criticized the district's school board over the curriculum on gender identity, including at an oct. 19 school board meeting at which a lawyer for the board said in his interpretation of the law that parents do not have the right to determine what is taught at their children's school. 

the right of parents ""is not to dictate what their children are taught, it is to determine where they attend,"" lawyer john comegno said at the time.

the garden state does not have a school voucher program that would allow parents to use public funds designated for their child's education on tuition for another school.

""defenders of the government school monopoly believe they have the right to raise other people's kids in the way they see fit,"" corey deangelis, american federation for children's senior fellow and school choice activist, told fox news digital. ""it's a deeply flawed philosophical position that most people find backwards. children do not belong to the government. parents are in the best position to make education decisions for their own kids and have the fundamental right to do so.""

""the main problem is that the government school system is a one-size-fits-all disaster that will, by definition, never meet the needs of every individual family,"" he added. ""parents disagree about how they want their kids to be raised and educated – and that's ok. the problem is that special interests get to dictate how to raise other people's kids in the current system."" 

deangelis explained that the ""only way out of this mess through freedom rather than force is to fund students directly and empower families to choose the education providers that best meet their needs and align with their values.

""at the same time, competition will give public schools an incentive to focus on the basics because most parents want their kids to get an education as opposed to indoctrination.""

the district is represented by u.s. democrat rep. andy kim, who defeated republican challenger bob healey in the midterm elections. healey told fox news digital that kim ""is as radical as they come on issues involving our kids and our schools."" 

""he supports sex ed for kindergartners, biological males playing girls sports and thinks parents who attend school board meetings are ‘extremists’ for simply caring about what their kids are being taught in the classroom,"" healey said.

kim's office did not respond to a request for comment from fox news digital.

three lawrence township school board members up for re-election — pepper evans, michelle king and amanda santos — all won last week against challengers critical of the board and the district's curriculum.

""school choice is the only way to truly secure parental rights in education. new jersey public schools were funded at over $24,000 per student in 2020,"" deangelis said, citing data from the u.s. census bureau.

40db461a-7d86-47ed-8fec-f501ddd6ff46,anti,ncaa officially bans trans athletes from women's sports 1 day after trump signs executive order,"['ncaa', 'officially', 'ban', 'trans', 'athlete', 'woman', 'sport', 'day', 'trump', 'sign', 'executive', 'order']",fox,jackson thompson,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/ncaa-officially-bans-trans-athletes-from-womens-sports-1-day-after-trump-signs-executive-order,2/6/2025,"the ncaa has officially changed its gender eligibility policies to ban all biological males from women's sports one day after president donald trump signed an executive order to address the issue.

the governing body of college sports announced on thursday afternoon its new participation policy for transgender student-athletes. 

""a student-athlete assigned male at birth may not compete on a women’s team,"" the new policy reads. 

the new policy still allows biological females to compete on men's teams.

the previous policy, which had been in place in 2010, allowed biological males to compete in the women's category after undergoing at least one year of testosterone suppression treatment. 

trump signed the ""no men in women’s sports"" executive order in the east room of the white house in front of female athletes on national girls and women in sports day on wednesday. 

ncaa president charlie baker responded to the executive order in a statement later on wednesday, saying it provided a ""clear, national standard,"" and that the ncaa board of governors would review it and take steps to align the organization’s policy in the coming days.

""the ncaa is an organization made up of 1,100 colleges and universities in all 50 states that collectively enroll more than 530,000 student-athletes,"" the statement said. ""we strongly believe that clear, consistent and uniform eligibility standards would best serve today's student-athletes instead of a patchwork of conflicting state laws and court decisions. to that end, president trump's order provides a clear, national standard.

""the ncaa board of governors is reviewing the executive order and will take necessary steps to align ncaa policy in the coming days, subject to further guidance from the administration. the association will continue to help foster welcoming environments on campuses for all student-athletes. we stand ready to assist schools as they look for ways to support any student-athletes affected by changes in the policy.""

baker addressed concerns over the issue of female athletes having to share teams and locker rooms with trans athletes during a senate judiciary committee hearing in december. 

there, baker insisted that female athletes have the option to find other accommodations if they're uncomfortable sharing with transgenders and that the ncaa's policies that allow trans athletes to compete against women are based on federal standards. 

the previous policy has resulted in multiple lawsuits against the ncaa and its member schools. former ncaa swimmer and current conservative activist riley gaines is leading a lawsuit over her experience of having to compete with and share a locker room with trans swimmer lia thomas at the 2022 national championships. she is joined by several other women athletes who have also been affected by trans inclusion. 

another lawsuit was filed tuesday evening, when three of thomas' former upenn teammates came forward with their own experiences of having to share a team and locker room with thomas and were allegedly gaslit by their university administrators and fed pro-trans ideology. 

trump's department of education (doe) also launched an investigation into potential title ix violations that occurred at upenn over the thomas situation, san jose state university and at the massachusetts interscholastic athletic association (miaa) for separate incidents.

at san jose state, transgender volleyball player blaire fleming played three seasons on the women's team from 2022-24, as one of the mountain west's top hitters, leading the team in kills. however, unlike upenn's handling of thomas, sjsu administrators allegedly withheld the truth about fleming's birth sex from the other female players on the team, according to a lawsuit filed by 11 mountain west volleyball players and a former sjsu assistant coach. 

additionally, doe's office for civil rights will be actively reviewing athletic participation policies at a number of schools to evaluate their alignment with title ix protections for female athletes, sources told fox news digital. 

last week, the doe notified k-12 schools and higher education institutions of a return to enforcing title ix protections on the basis of biological sex. 

a recent new york times/ipsos survey found the vast majority of americans, including a majority of democrats, don't think transgender athletes should be permitted to compete in women's sports. of the 2,128 people polled, 79% said biological males who identify as women should not be allowed to participate in women's sports. 

of the 1,025 people who identified as democrats or leaning democrat, 67% said transgender athletes should not be allowed to compete with women.","['ncaa', 'officially', 'change', 'gender', 'eligibility', 'policy', 'ban', 'biological', 'male', 'woman', 'sport', 'day', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'sign', 'executive', 'order', 'address', 'issue', 'govern', 'body', 'college', 'sport', 'announce', 'thursday', 'afternoon', 'new', 'participation', 'policy', 'transgender', 'student', 'athlete', 'student', 'athlete', 'assign', 'male', 'birth', 'compete', 'woman', 'team', 'new', 'policy', 'read', 'new', 'policy', 'allow', 'biological', 'female', 'compete', 'man', 'team', 'previous', 'policy', 'place', 'allow', 'biological', 'male', 'compete', 'woman', 'category', 'undergo', 'year', 'testosterone', 'suppression', 'treatment', 'trump', 'sign', 'man', 'woman', 'sport', 'executive', 'order', 'east', 'room', 'white', 'house', 'female', 'athlete', 'national', 'girl', 'woman', 'sport', 'day', 'wednesday', 'ncaa', 'president', 'charlie', 'baker', 'respond', 'executive', 'order', 'statement', 'later', 'wednesday', 'say', 'provide', 'clear', 'national', 'standard', 'ncaa', 'board', 'governor', 'review', 'step', 'align', 'organization', 'policy', 'come', 'day', 'ncaa', 'organization', 'college', 'university', 'state', 'collectively', 'enroll', 'student', 'athlete', 'statement', 'say', 'strongly', 'believe', 'clear', 'consistent', 'uniform', 'eligibility', 'standard', 'well', 'serve', 'today', 'student', 'athlete', 'instead', 'patchwork', 'conflict', 'state', 'law', 'court', 'decision', 'end', 'president', 'trump', 'order', 'provide', 'clear', 'national', 'standard', 'ncaa', 'board', 'governor', 'review', 'executive', 'order', 'necessary', 'step', 'align', 'ncaa', 'policy', 'come', 'day', 'subject', 'guidance', 'administration', 'association', 'continue', 'help', 'foster', 'welcome', 'environment', 'campus', 'student', 'athlete', 'stand', 'ready', 'assist', 'school', 'look', 'way', 'support', 'student', 'athlete', 'affect', 'change', 'policy', 'baker', 'address', 'concern', 'issue', 'female', 'athlete', 'have', 'share', 'team', 'locker', 'room', 'trans', 'athlete', 'senate', 'judiciary', 'committee', 'hearing', 'december', 'baker', 'insist', 'female', 'athlete', 'option', 'find', 'accommodation', 'uncomfortable', 'share', 'transgender', 'ncaa', 'policy', 'allow', 'tran', 'athlete', 'compete', 'woman', 'base', 'federal', 'standard', 'previous', 'policy', 'result', 'multiple', 'lawsuit', 'ncaa', 'member', 'school', 'ncaa', 'swimmer', 'current', 'conservative', 'activist', 'riley', 'gaine', 'lead', 'lawsuit', 'experience', 'have', 'compete', 'share', 'locker', 'room', 'trans', 'swimmer', 'lia', 'thomas', 'national', 'championship', 'join', 'woman', 'athlete', 'affect', 'trans', 'inclusion', 'lawsuit', 'file', 'tuesday', 'evening', 'thomas', 'upenn', 'teammate', 'come', 'forward', 'experience', 'have', 'share', 'team', 'locker', 'room', 'thomas', 'allegedly', 'gaslit', 'university', 'administrator', 'feed', 'pro', 'trans', 'ideology', 'trump', 'department', 'education', 'doe', 'launch', 'investigation', 'potential', 'title', 'ix', 'violation', 'occur', 'upenn', 'thomas', 'situation', 'san', 'jose', 'state', 'university', 'massachusetts', 'interscholastic', 'athletic', 'association', 'miaa', 'separate', 'incident', 'san', 'jose', 'state', 'transgender', 'volleyball', 'player', 'blaire', 'fleming', 'play', 'season', 'woman', 'team', 'mountain', 'west', 'hitter', 'lead', 'team', 'kill', 'unlike', 'upenn', 'handling', 'thomas', 'sjsu', 'administrator', 'allegedly', 'withhold', 'truth', 'fleming', 'birth', 'sex', 'female', 'player', 'team', 'accord', 'lawsuit', 'file', 'mountain', 'west', 'volleyball', 'player', 'sjsu', 'assistant', 'coach', 'additionally', 'doe', 'office', 'civil', 'right', 'actively', 'review', 'athletic', 'participation', 'policy', 'number', 'school', 'evaluate', 'alignment', 'title', 'ix', 'protection', 'female', 'athlete', 'source', 'tell', 'fox', 'news', 'digital', 'week', 'doe', 'notify', 'school', 'high', 'education', 'institution', 'return', 'enforce', 'title', 'ix', 'protection', 'basis', 'biological', 'sex', 'recent', 'new', 'york', 'times', 'ipsos', 'survey', 'find', 'vast', 'majority', 'americans', 'include', 'majority', 'democrat', 'think', 'transgender', 'athlete', 'permit', 'compete', 'woman', 'sport', 'people', 'poll', 'say', 'biological', 'male', 'identify', 'woman', 'allow', 'participate', 'woman', 'sport', 'people', 'identify', 'democrats', 'lean', 'democrat', 'say', 'transgender', 'athlete', 'allow', 'compete', 'woman']",

u.s. district judge ana reyes in washington, d.c., issued a preliminary injunction barring the pentagon from enforcing trump's order, which asserted ""expressing a false ‘gender identity’ divergent from an individual’s sex cannot satisfy the rigorous standards necessary for military service."" the order, issued jan. 27, instructed the department of defense (dod) to update its medical standards for military service and pronoun policies, stating that ""beyond the hormonal and surgical medical interventions involved, adoption of a gender identity inconsistent with an individual’s sex conflicts with a soldier’s commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one's personal life."" 

reyes said that the executive order likely poses constitutional rights violations. 

""the court knows that this opinion will lead to heated public debate and appeals. in a healthy democracy, both are positive outcomes,"" reyes wrote, delaying her order until friday morning to allow time for the trump administration to appeal. ""we should all agree, however, that every person who has answered the call to serve deserves our gratitude and respect.""

transgender individuals were considered unfit for u.s. military service until the dod changed its policy during former president barack obama's second term. 

in her 79-page ruling, reyes in part cites lin-manuel miranda's musical ""hamilton"" to justify blocking the ban on transgender troops. 

""women were ‘included in the sequel’ when passage of the nineteenth amendment granted them the right to vote in 1920,"" reyes wrote in the footnotes, adding, ""that right is one of the many that thousands of transgender persons serve to protect.""

reyes said plaintiffs ""face a violation of their constitutional rights, which constitutes irreparable harm."" 

""indeed, the cruel irony is that thousands of transgender servicemembers have sacrificed – some risking their lives – to ensure for others the very equal protection rights the military ban seeks to deny them,"" the judge wrote, adding that the defendants, on the other hand, ""have not shown they will be burdened by continuing the status quo pending this litigation, and avoiding constitutional violations is always in the public interest."" 

white house deputy chief of staff stephen miller condemned reyes' ruling on x, writing, ""district court judges have now decided they are in command of the armed forces…is there no end to this madness?"" 

reyes was the second judge of the day to rule against the trump administration. trump called for impeaching a third judge who temporarily blocked deportation flights, drawing a rare rebuke from chief justice john roberts.
transgender veteran protests against trump

""unelected rogue judges are trying to steal years of time from a 4 year term. it’s the most egregious theft one can imagine: robbing the vote and voice of the american people,"" miller wrote in another x post. 

in response to trump's executive order, defense secretary pete hegseth issued a policy on feb. 26 that presumptively disqualifies people with gender dysphoria from military service. the policy says, ""a current diagnosis or history of, or exhibit symptoms consistent with, gender dysphoria are incompatible with the high mental and physical standards necessary for military service.""

plaintiffs’ attorneys contend trump’s order violates transgender people’s rights to equal protection under the fifth amendment.

government lawyers argue that military officials have broad discretion to decide how to assign and deploy service members without judicial interference.

(jim watson/afp via getty images)

reyes said she did not take lightly her decision to issue an injunction blocking trump’s order, noting that ""judicial overreach is no less pernicious than executive overreach."" however, she said, it was also the responsibility of each branch of government to provide checks and balances for the others, and the court ""therefore must act to uphold the equal protection rights that the military defends every day.""

thousands of transgender people serve in the military, but they represent less than 1% of the total number of active-duty service members, according to the associated press. 

in 2016, a dod policy permitted transgender people to serve openly in the military. during trump’s first term, he issued a directive to ban transgender service members. the supreme court allowed the ban to take effect. 

biden, a democrat who served as obama's vice president, scrapped it when he took office.","['federal', 'judge', 'appoint', 'president', 'joe', 'biden', 'block', 'president', 'donald', 'trump',

the research is looking to discover how much medical intervention there needs to be for a male to ""fairly"" compete in girls’ and women’s sports. 

the first notion that nike was allegedly funding was in a new york times article published over the weekend about the plight of blaire fleming – the san jose state spartans transgender female volleyball player who played a controversial role in the 2024-25 ncaa women’s volleyball season.

outkick pointed out that the piece mentions joanna harper, a trans woman who studies transgender athletes, is ""currently helping to lead an ambitious study of trans adolescents that measures their results on a 10-step fitness test before they start hormone therapy and then, after they have begun to medically transition, every six months for five years.""

the article then read, ""but, she told me when we talked in february, ‘the current climate makes the study somewhat uncertain.’ i assumed she was referring to the trump administration’s cuts to national institutes of health research grants, but she said money was not a problem: the study is being funded by nike. the problem was trump’s separate order targeting medical care for transgender youth. ‘if we can’t perform gender-affirming care,’ she explained, ‘then we can’t bring people into the study.""

fox news digital has reached out to nike for comment. the company has not yet to offer any clarification on the matter, according to outkick.

sey appeared on ""don’t @ me with dan dakich"" and completely eviscerated the idea of the study even happening.

jennifer sey founed xx-xy athletics in march 2024. the message of the name of the brand ""is that there is empirical truth. biology is true,"" she said. (xx-xy athletics)

""she’s trying to understand what they call ‘retained male advantage’ and is there little enough of it that these boys can pass for competing with girls,"" sey said. it’s so wrong on so many levels. . . . why is a shoe brand involved in this at all?

""but from a women’s and girls’ perspective, we are not impaired boys. it’s so degrading to think of us that way. would we do a study that says, ‘how many fingers can we cut off of a boy to make it ok for him to compete in tennis with a girl?’ that’s what we’re doing here. outside of the fact that why is nike incentivizing this kind of work? this experimental medical treatment of young boys that disfigures them and sterilizes them for life.""

sey said she thought the decision to fund a study like this may have happened years ago.

""senior executives probably didn’t know what was happening. this is something that happened deep in the organization,"" sey suggested. ""and this harper thought, he was proud of it, and he talked about it. . . . i believe nike is like, ‘oh, crap. now we have to defend ourselves.’""

the american civil liberties union (aclu) sued the indiana department of corrections last year on behalf of a transgender inmate, jonathan c. richardson, also known as autumn cordellionè, who was convicted of strangling his 11-month-old stepdaughter to death in 2001.

indiana law, however, prohibits the department of corrections from using taxpayer dollars to fund sex reassignment surgeries for inmates. however, the aclu argues in the lawsuit, filed on aug. 28, 2023, that the law is a violation of the eighth amendment’s prohibition of ""cruel and unusual punishment.""

(indiana department of corrections/getty images)

the surgery for richardson, who is serving out a 55-year prison sentence for reckless homicide, ""is a medical necessity,"" according to the aclu lawsuit.

judge richard young agreed with the aclu's claims and ruled in favor of cordellioné last week.

""specifically, ms. cordellioné has shown that her gender dysphoria is a serious medical need, and that, despite other treatments defendant has provided her to treat her gender dysphoria, she requires gender-affirming surgery to prevent a risk of serious bodily and psychological harm,"" the ruling states.

the doc must now take ""all reasonable actions"" to ensure cordellioné undergoes sex surgery, according to the order.

indiana attorney general todd rokita, a republican, said in a post on x that his office is still reviewing the judge's decision, ""but you can undoubtedly expect our office to appeal this decision.""

""an indiana inmate convicted of murder wants our taxpayers to fund their gender-altering surgery! hoosiers do not want thism"" rokita said.

the original aclu filing says cordellioné was diagnosed in 2020 with gender dysphoria and prescribed female hormones and testosterone blockers, both of which he has ""consistently taken since that time."" other accommodations provided for the inmate include ""panties, make up, and form fitting clothing.""

""accordingly, at this point gender-affirming surgery is necessary so that her physical identity can be aligned with her gender identity and so her gender dysphoria can be ameliorated,"" the lawsuit states.

""she believes that the only remedy for her persistent gender dysphoria, and the serious harm it causes her, is to receive gender-affirming surgery, specifically an orchiectomy and vaginoplasty,"" it said.

cordellioné has identified as a woman since 6 years old, the aclu lawsuit also claims, and the inmate is ""a woman trapped in a man's body.""

according to court documents, cordellioné strangled his then-wife’s 11-month-year old daughter to death while she was at work on sept. 12, 2001. during rcordellioné's initial interview with one of the detectives, he was calm and ""unemotional"" when recounting what happened, court documents from indiana's court of appeals show.","['federal', 'judge', 'rule', 'unconstitutional', 'indiana', 'prison', 'deny', 'transgender', 'inmate', 'sex', 'reassignment', 'surgery', 'follow', 'inmate', 'lawsuit', 'facility', 'american', 'civil', 'liberties', 'union', 'aclu', 'sue', 'indiana', 'department', 'correction', 'year', 'behalf', 'transgender', 'inmate', 'jonathan', 'richardson', 'know', 'autumn', 'cordellionè', 'convict', 'strangle', 'month', 'old', 'stepdaughter', 'death', 'indiana', 'law', 'prohibit', 'department', 'correction', 'taxpayer', 'dollar', 'fund', 'sex', 'reassignment', 'surgery', 'inmate', 'aclu', 'argue', 'lawsuit', 'file', 'aug', 'law', 'violation', 'eighth', 'amendment', 'prohibition', 'cruel', 'unusual', 'punishment', 'american', 'civil', 'liberties', 'union', 'aclu', 'sue', 'indiana', 'department', 'correction', 'behalf', 'transgender', 'inmate', 'jonathan', 'richardson', 'know', 'autumn', 'cordellionè', 'convict', 'strangle', 'month', 'old', 'stepdaughter', 'death', 'indiana', 'department', 'correction', 'getty', 'image', 'surgery', 'richardson', 'serve', 'year', 'prison', 'sentence', 'reckless', 'homicide', 'medical', 'necessity', 'accord', 'aclu', 'lawsuit', 'judge', 'richard', 'young', 'agree', 'aclu', 'claim', 'rule', 'favor', 'cordellioné', 'week', 'specifically', 'ms', 'cordellioné', 'show', 'gender', 'dysphoria', 'medical', 'need', 'despite', 'treatment', 'defendant', 'provide', 'treat', 'gender', 'dysphoria', 'require', 'gender', 'affirm', 'surgery', 'prevent', 'risk', 'bodily', 'psychological', 'harm', 'rule', 'state', 'doc', 'reasonable', 'action', 'ensure', 'cordellioné', 'undergoe', 'sex', 'surgery', 'accord', 'order', 'indiana', 'attorney', 'general', 'todd', 'rokita', 'republican', 'say', 'post', 'x', 'office', 'review', 'judge', 'decision', 'undoubtedly', 'expect', 'office', 'appeal', 'decision', 'indiana', 'inmate', 'convict', 'murder', 'want', 'taxpayer', 'fund', 'gender', 'alter', 'surgery', 'hoosier', 'want', 'thism', 'rokita', 'say', 'original', 'aclu', 'filing', 'say', 'cordellioné', 'diagnose', 'gender', 'dysphoria', 'prescribe', 'female', 'hormone', 'testosterone', 'blocker', 'consistently', 'take', 'time', 'accommodation', 'provide', 'inmate', 'include', 'pantie', 'form', 'fitting', 'clothing', 'accordingly', 'point', 'gender', 'affirm', 'surgery', 'necessary', 'physical', 'identity', 'align', 'gender', 'identity', 'gender', 'dysphoria', 'ameliorate', 'lawsuit', 'state', 'believe', 'remedy', 'persistent', 'gender', 'dysphoria', 'harm', 'cause', 'receive', 'gender', 'affirm', 'surgery', 'specifically', 'orchiectomy', 'vaginoplasty', 'say', 'cordellioné', 'identify', 'woman', 'year', 'old', 'aclu', 'lawsuit', 'claim', 'inmate', 'woman', 'trap', 'man', 'body', 'accord', 'court', 'document', 'cordellioné', 'strangle', 'wife', 'month', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'death', 'work', 'sept', 'rcordellioné', 'initial', 'interview', 'detective', 'calm', 'unemotional', 'recount', 'happen', 'court', 'document', 'indiana', 'court', 'appeal']",

“there are no concerns about individuals who are just choosing which gender they want to give themself in order to participate,” democrat maine attorney general aaron frey said in an interview with cnn. “so that, that too is really after a lot of work on whether or not there’s any issue here that warrants this intrusion by the federal government into what’s going on in maine schools.”

frey was on cnn to defend his state’s refusal to comply with title ix federal civil rights law by continuing to allow men to compete against women. his appearance came after u.s. attorney general pam bondi announced a civil lawsuit against maine for its noncompliance in the wake of multiple federal agencies trying to get the state to stop putting women and girls at risk for weeks.

“we’ve been working through to understand what, if any problem, really exists with the participation, if some of the harms that are being alleged really are of some concern, and what we’ve identified is, there really is — there are no concerns of safety,” frey told cnn.

frey either has no clue what he is talking about or is lying through his teeth, because it is not hard to find instances of serious injuries to women and girls at the hands of the biologically stronger and larger males they are forced to compete against.

take payton mcnabb, for instance. she was invited as one of president donald trump’s guests to his address to a joint session of congress earlier this year because she suffered a concussion, brain bleed, and other trauma when a male athlete spiked a volleyball violently directly into her face. she still has issues with vision, partial paralysis, and mental health concerns associated with such injuries.

a massachusetts girls’ basketball team had to forfeit after a male on the opposing team kept injuring players “basically, all game,” according to the account of the athletic director of the forfeiting team.

numerous sports leagues have issued statements and regulations barring men from competing against women expressly because of the physical danger presented to women in competition.

the united nations special rapporteur on violence against women and girls, reem alsalem, also expressed concern about the likelihood of violence from the biden administration’s title ix rewrite that would allow men in women’s sports across the board. not only is there concern for physical harm in competition, but trans policies also create the opportunity for violence when females are forced to share restrooms and locker rooms with males, or sleep in the same room with them during overnight team trips.

in bondi’s lawsuit announcement on wednesday, she acknowledged the injuries, saying, “some of these young women have endured vicious injuries, too, as a result of boys playing in their sports.”

“these boys are allowed to go in women’s restrooms, they are allowed to go in the women’s dressing rooms and get fully naked and change — biological boys — and change clothes in front of these young women,” she said. “maine’s leadership has refused to comply at every turn, so now, we have no other choice: we are taking them to court.”

gov. janet mills, d-maine, who has been obstinate in her quest to ensure the highest amount of harm comes to women and girls within the scope of title ix, issued a statement in response to the lawsuit, saying in part, “this matter has never been about school sports or the protection of women and girls, as has been claimed, it is about states rights and defending the rule of law against a federal government bent on imposing its will, instead of upholding the law.”

maine has been claiming that the right to allow men in women’s sports is fully in line with title ix, despite the fact that the law was expressly passed to protect women’s opportunities in education and sports. the federal government, which enforces title ix, as well as federal courts, have also made clear that maine’s queer theory understanding of title ix is far afield from what the law means.","['department', 'justice', 'sue', 'maine', 'put', 'woman', 'girl', 'risk', 'allow', 'male', 'compete', 'sport', 'state', 'attorney', 'general', 'claim', 'zero', 'evidence', 'maine', 'ideology', 'pose', 'concern', 'safety', 'concern', 'individual', 'choose', 'gender', 'want', 'themself', 'order', 'participate', 'democrat', 'maine', 'attorney', 'general', 'aaron', 'frey', 'say', 'interview', 'cnn', 'lot', 'work', 'issue', 'warrant', 'intrusion', 'federal', 'government', 'go', 'maine', 'school', 'frey', 'cnn', 'defend', 'state', 'refusal', 'comply', 'title', 'ix', 'federal', 'civil', 'right', 'law', 'continue', 'allow', 'man', 'compete', 'woman', 'appearance', 'come', 'attorney', 'general', 'pam', 'bondi', 'announce', 'civil', 'lawsuit', 'maine', 'noncompliance', 'wake', 'multiple', 'federal', 'agency', 'try', 'state', 'stop', 'put', 'woman', 'girl', 'risk', 'week', 'work', 'understand', 'problem', 'exist', 'participation', 'harm', 'allege', 'concern', 'identify', 'concern', 'safety', 'frey', 'tell', 'cnn', 'frey', 'clue', 'talk', 'lie', 'tooth', 'hard', 'find', 'instance', 'injury', 'woman', 'girl', 'hand', 'biologically', 'strong', 'large', 'male', 'force', 'compete', 'payton', 'mcnabb', 'instance', 'invite', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'guest', 'address', 'joint', 'session', 'congress', 'early', 'year', 'suffer', 'concussion', 'brain', 'bleed', 'trauma', 'male', 'athlete', 'spike', 'volleyball', 'violently', 'directly', 'face', 'issue', 'vision', 'partial', 'paralysis', 'mental', 'health', 'concern', 'associate', 'injury', 'massachusetts', 'girl', 'basketball', 'team', 'forfeit', 'male', 'oppose', 'team', 'keep', 'injure', 'player', 'basically', 'game', 'accord', 'account', 'athletic', 'director', 'forfeit', 'team', 'numerous', 'sport', 'league', 'issue', 'statement', 'regulation', 'bar', 'man', 'compete', 'woman', 'expressly', 'physical', 'danger', 'present', 'woman', 'competition', 'united', 'nations', 'special', 'rapporteur', 'violence', 'woman', 'girl', 'reem', 'alsalem', 'express', 'concern', 'likelihood', 'violence', 'biden', 'administration', 'title', 'ix', 'rewrite', 'allow', 'man', 'woman', 'sport', 'board', 'concern', 'physical', 'harm', 'competition', 'trans', 'policy', 'create', 'opportunity', 'violence', 'female', 'force', 'share', 'restroom', 'locker', 'room', 'male', 'sleep', 'room', 'overnight', 'team', 'trip', 'bondi', 'lawsuit', 'announcement', 'wednesday', 'acknowledge', 'injury', 'say', 'young', 'woman', 'endure', 'vicious', 'injury', 'result', 'boy', 'play', 'sport', 'boy', 'allow', 'woman', 'restroom', 'allow', 'woman', 'dress', 'room', 'fully', 'naked', 'change', 'biological', 'boy', 'change', 'clothe', 'young', 'woman', 'say', 'maine', 'leadership', 'refuse', 'comply', 'turn', 'choice', 'take', 'court', 'gov', 'janet', 'mills', 'd', 'maine', 'obstinate', 'quest', 'ensure', 'high', 'harm', 'come', 'woman', 'girl', 'scope', 'title', 'ix', 'issue', 'statement', 'response', 'lawsuit', 'say', 'matter', 'school', 'sport', 'protection', 'woman', 'girl', 'claim', 'state', 'right', 'defend', 'rule', 'law', 'federal', 'government', 'bend', 'impose', 'instead', 'uphold', 'law', 'maine', 'claim', 'right', 'allow', 'man', 'woman', 'sport', 'fully', 'line', 'title', 'ix', 'despite', 'fact', 'law', 'expressly', 'pass', 'protect', 'woman', 'opportunity', 'education', 'sport', 'federal', 'government', 'enforce', 'title', 'ix', 'federal', 'court', 'clear', 'maine', 'queer', 'theory', 'understanding', 'title', 'ix', 'far', 'afield', 'law', 'mean']",

good.

“gender identities” that are disconnected from our embodiment as male and female are nonsense. this is demonstrated by harmon’s own clumsy writing; consider this clunker from a passage on public opinion regarding trans issues: “[n]early 80 percent do not believe transgender female athletes should be allowed to compete in women’s sports.” these “transgender female athletes” are, of course, male, but gender ideology demands the destruction of clear language and thought.

this is why transgender identities must not be given recognition and legitimacy in law and culture. it is tempting for some people to cede ground to transgenderism as a sort of polite fiction. calling the dude in a dress “she” might seem to be a white lie, sort of like making a child with cancer a captain of his favorite football team. and some people who are horrified at the transitioning of kids are nonetheless inclined to allow it for adults.

but as we have seen, this make-believe is untenable; the white lies have gotten darker, and the envelope keeps getting pushed. it was inevitable that, instead of being content with polite fictions, trans activists would force everyone to pretend the lies are 100 percent true. it is as if the make-a-wish kid started to act as if he really were the star quarterback and expected everyone else to keep going along with it. eventually the lie, however kindly it may have been meant, becomes unsustainable and has to be broken before it breaks everything else.

lies about essential matters are never white. this isn’t like pretending to enjoy what your aunt or sister-in-law brought to thanksgiving dinner; it is about the basic realities of human existence. the differences between males and females are literally responsible for all of us coming into existence. yet the new york times apparently regards the differences between men and women as unproven, with harmon describing supporters of the president’s actions as being motivated by “what they believe are fundamental biological differences between men and women.” 

but biology is not a matter of opinion. politics and culture must be built on truth, which is why affirming transgender identities is always corrupting. for instance, these lies always degraded and distorted the practice of medicine. instead of healers, so-called gender-affirming care turns doctors into cosmetic technicians who inflict physical harm on their patients to reshape clients’ bodies to resemble fantasies. this corrupted medicine allows, even encourages, people to destroy themselves. there is never any medical need to transition. instead of compassionate care to resolve the psychological issues that have alienated patients from their natural, healthy bodies, “gender doctors” offer a lifetime of futile and harmful medicalization.

and these evils are not confined to those who receive these procedures. there are the family members who must witness the destruction — including wives whose husbands no longer want to be men, children whose fathers no longer want to be fathers, and parents whose daughters no longer wish to be daughters — and are commanded to affirm and praise it. 

this dynamic of forced affirmation eventually extends to everyone. polite fictions become mandatory dogmas — “trans women are women!” — and the truth is banished as offensive. and then the entire range of evils championed by the transgender movement is released on society, from putting male murderers and rapists in women’s prisons to sterilizing and mutilating children. 

these poisoned fruits of the transgender tree have consistently been implemented as the transgender movement gains power in different nations, demonstrating that they are intrinsic to it. so it would be folly to be content with only curbing the worst instances of transgender ideology rather than uprooting it. we have seen that any sort of “white lie” legitimation of transgender identities is unsustainable. 

thus we must not weary of the battle before it is won. our recent victories are akin to d-day or the battle of midway — a turning point, but it’s still a long way to berlin or tokyo. though the other side is in retreat, they are still fighting, filing lawsuits, trying to shore up their blue-state strongholds, and scheming of ways to circumvent bans on transitioning children. see, for example, this recent new england journal of medicine article suggesting “implementing telehealth services and out-of-state referral pathways.” 

those who have staked their livelihoods and reputations on transgender ideology are not going to give up quietly and go away. many who have dedicated their lives to the lie that it is possible to transition to the opposite sex will also persist in this falsehood to the bitter end. this is tragic, but it is not a kindness to affirm these lies, for doing so only perpetuates them and creates new victims.","['new', 'york', 'times', 'upset', 'president', 'trump', 'respect', 'transgender', 'identity', 'editorial', 'board', 'disapprove', 'executive', 'order', 'roll', 'gender', 'ideology', 'piece', 'amy', 'harmon', 'accuse', 'undermine', 'idea', 'transgender', 'identity', 'legitimate', 'recognize', 'good', 'gender', 'identity', 'disconnect', 'embodiment', 'male', 'female', 'nonsense', 'demonstrate', 'harmon', 'clumsy', 'writing', 'consider', 'clunker', 'passage', 'public', 'opinion', 'trans', 'issue', 'percent', 'believe', 'transgender', 'female', 'athlete', 'allow', 'compete', 'woman', 'sport', 'transgender', 'female', 'athlete', 'course', 'male', 'gender', 'ideology', 'demand', 'destruction', 'clear', 'language', 'thought', 'transgender', 'identity', 'give', 'recognition', 'legitimacy', 'law', 'culture', 'tempting', 'people', 'cede', 'ground', 'transgenderism', 'sort', 'polite', 'fiction', 'call', 'dude', 'dress', 'white', 'lie', 'sort', 'like', 'make', 'child', 'cancer', 'captain', 'favorite', 'football', 'team', 'people', 'horrify', 'transitioning', 'kid', 'nonetheless', 'inclined', 'allow', 'adult', 'see', 'believe', 'untenable', 'white', 'lie', 'get', 'dark', 'envelope', 'keep', 'getting', 'push', 'inevitable', 'instead', 'content', 'polite', 'fiction', 'trans', 'activist', 'force', 'pretend', 'lie', 'percent', 'true', 'wish', 'kid', 'start', 'act', 'star', 'quarterback', 'expect', 'go', 'eventually', 'lie', 'kindly', 'mean', 'unsustainable', 'break', 'break', 'lie', 'essential', 'matter', 'white', 'like', 'pretend', 'enjoy', 'aunt', 'sister', 'law', 'bring', 'thanksgive', 'dinner', 'basic', 'reality', 'human', 'existence', 'difference', 'male', 'female', 'literally', 'responsible', 'come', 'existence', 'new', 'york', 'times', 'apparently', 'regard', 'difference', 'man', 'woman', 'unproven', 'harmon', 'describe', 'supporter', 'president', 'action', 'motivate', 'believe', 'fundamental', 'biological', 'difference', 'man', 'woman', 'biology', 'matter', 'opinion', 'politic', 'culture', 'build', 'truth', 'affirm', 'transgender', 'identity', 'corrupting', 'instance', 'lie', 'degrade', 'distort', 'practice', 'medicine', 'instead', 'healer', 'call', 'gender', 'affirm', 'care', 'turn', 'doctor', 'cosmetic', 'technician', 'inflict', 'physical', 'harm', 'patient', 'reshape', 'client', 'body', 'resemble', 'fantasy', 'corrupted', 'medicine', 'allow', 'encourage', 'people', 'destroy', 'medical', 'need', 'transition', 'instead', 'compassionate', 'care', 'resolve', 'psychological', 'issue', 'alienate', 'patient', 'natural', 'healthy', 'body', 'gender', 'doctor', 'offer', 'lifetime', 'futile', 'harmful', 'medicalization', 'evil', 'confine', 'receive', 'procedure', 'family', 'member', 'witness', 'destruction', 'include', 'wife', 'husband', 'long', 'want', 'man', 'child', 'father', 'long', 'want', 'father', 'parent', 'daughter', 'long', 'wish', 'daughter', 'command', 'affirm', 'praise', 'dynamic', 'forced', 'affirmation', 'eventually', 'extend', 'polite', 'fiction', 'mandatory', 'dogma', 'trans', 'woman', 'woman', 'truth', 'banish', 'offensive', 'entire', 'range', 'evil', 'champion', 'transgender', 'movement', 'release', 'society', 'put', 'male', 'murderer', 'rapist', 'woman', 'prison', 'sterilize', 'mutilate', 'child', 'poison', 'fruit', 'transgender', 'tree', 'consistently', 'implement', 'transgender', 'movement', 'gain', 'power', 'different', 'nation', 'demonstrate', 'intrinsic', 'folly', 'content', 'curb', 'bad', 'instance', 'transgender', 'ideology', 'uproot', 'see', 'sort', 'white', 'lie', 'legitimation', 'transgender', 'identity', 'unsustainable', 'weary', 'battle', 'win', 'recent', 'victory', 'akin', 'd', 'day', 'battle', 'midway', 'turning', 'point', 'long', 'way', 'berlin', 'tokyo', 'retreat', 'fight', 'file', 'lawsuit', 'try', 'shore', 'blue', 'state', 'stronghold', 'scheme', 'way', 'circumvent', 'ban', 'transition', 'child', 'example', 'recent', 'new', 'england', 'journal', 'medicine', 'article', 'suggest', 'implement', 'telehealth', 'service', 'state', 'referral', 'pathway', 'stake', 'livelihood', 'reputation', 'transgender', 'ideology', 'go', 'quietly', 'away', 'dedicate', 'life', 'lie', 'possible', 'transition', 'opposite', 'sex', 'persist', 'falsehood', 'bitter', 'end', 'tragic', 'kindness', 'affirm', 'lie', 'perpetuate', 'create', 'new', 'victim']",
2d72105c-997d-4e41-a39f-5a8fc587ddb1,anti,speaker mike johnson’s response to the trans bathroom fracas in congress was cowardly,"['speaker', 'mike', 'johnson', 'response', 'trans', 'bathroom', 'fraca', 'congress', 'cowardly']",the federalist,john daniel davidson,https://thefederalist.com/2024/11/19/speaker-mike-johnsons-response-to-the-trans-bathroom-fracas-in-congress-was-cowardly/,11/19/2024,"house speaker mike johnson failed to answer a very easy question lobbed at him tuesday morning. he was asked whether rep. sarah mcbride, an incoming freshman lawmaker from delaware who identifies as transgender, is a man or a woman. mcbride is a man who presents as a woman, so johnson’s answer should have been easy: mcbride is a man.

but he couldn’t do it. instead, he smirked and deflected. “i’m not gonna get into this,” he said. “we treat all persons with dignity and respect. and we will. and i’m not going to engage in silly debates about this.”

johnson did, however, acknowledge that “there’s a concern about the uses of restroom facilities and locker room and all that.” oh is there?

the background here is that rep. nancy mace, who understandably doesn’t want to share a bathroom or a locker room with mcbride, or any other man, introduced a bill stipulating that on capitol hill women must use the women’s facilities and men must use the men’s.

it would have been the easiest thing in the world for johnson to have simply said, “mcbride is a man and he will have to use the men’s facilities here in congress. just because he dresses as a woman or thinks he’s a woman doesn’t make him one. next question.”

johnson seems to think it’s still 2012 and republicans need to accept, or pretend to accept, the underlying premises of the woke left-wing worldview. he has apparently missed out on the vibe shift that just delivered a landslide victory to president-elect donald trump along with the senate and house to republicans.

he also seems unaware that the trans issue is a giant loser that most people are slowly backing away from and want nothing to do with. an overwhelming number of americans now agree on transgender issues. according to one recent survey, 72 percent of americans think it should be illegal to give children under age 18 puberty blockers and “gender reassignment” surgeries. just 13 percent think boys should be allowed to compete in girls’ sports, and only 19 percent think transgender propaganda should be taught in public schools.

what’s more, trump won and republicans have a majority in large part because of ads trashing democrats’ transgender nonsense. after such a resounding victory, johnson is now too scared to come out and state plainly that men are not allowed in women’s bathrooms on capitol hill?

perhaps sensing he was being mercilessly mocked for being a weak coward, johnson quickly convened an impromptu press conference later on tuesday to “clarify” and “walk forward” his earlier remarks. “for anybody who doesn’t know my well-established record on this issue, let me be unequivocally clear. a man is a man and a woman is a woman. and a man cannot become a woman,” johnson said. he then made noises about treating everyone with dignity.

he prefaced these remarks by explaining that he had “rejected the premise” of the earlier question about mcbride, “because the answer is so obvious.” but he hadn’t reject the premise, he simply refused to answer because it made him uncomfortable. he also never answered the original question, which was whether mcbride is a man or a woman. if he had really wanted to reject the premise and answer the question he would have said, “i reject the premise of the question. mcbride is a man, no matter how he dresses or what he calls himself.”

but even after his attempt to be “unequivocally clear,” he still hadn’t answered the specific question about whether mcbride is a man or a woman, or indicated what would happen to mace’s bill.

this shouldn’t be hard, and it’s frankly amazing that a republican house speaker, flush from a massive electoral victory that will leave the executive and legislative branches of government in gop hands come january, would fail so spectacularly on this very basic question. every single republican should support mace’s measure to ban men from women’s spaces on capitol hill, and anyone who isn’t on board should be shamed, mocked, and thrown out of office. that’s what johnson should have said, and without a second thought. but he didn’t because he’s a mealy-mouthed coward who’s afraid of being called mean things by the corporate press.

for her part, mace isn’t backing down. asked about it on tuesday, mace said, “if … being a feminist makes me an extremist, i’m totally here for it. … i’m not going to stand for a man, you know, someone with a penis, is in the women’s locker room — that’s not okay.”

and for her trouble, mace immediately started getting death threats from trans activists, one of whom said he wanted to find her in the women’s bathroom and kill her by bashing her face into the floor.

the time for tolerating this insanity is over. americans should refuse to go along with the delusion that men who dress up like women are anything other than disturbed men who need professional help. and we should demand that our elected leaders show more spine on this issue than speaker johnson was able to muster on tuesday.","['house', 'speaker', 'mike', 'johnson', 'fail', 'answer', 'easy', 'question', 'lob', 'tuesday', 'morning', 'ask', 'rep', 'sarah', 'mcbride', 'incoming', 'freshman', 'lawmaker', 'delaware', 'identify', 'transgender', 'man', 'woman', 'mcbride', 'man', 'present', 'woman', 'johnson', 'answer', 'easy', 'mcbride', 'man', 'instead', 'smirk', 'deflect', 'go', 'to', 'say', 'treat', 'person', 'dignity', 'respect', 'go', 'engage', 'silly', 'debate', 'johnson', 'acknowledge', 'concern', 'use', 'restroom', 'facility', 'locker', 'room', 'oh', 'background', 'rep', 'nancy', 'mace', 'understandably', 'want', 'share', 'bathroom', 'locker', 'room', 'mcbride', 'man', 'introduce', 'bill', 'stipulate', 'capitol', 'hill', 'woman', 'use', 'woman', 'facility', 'man', 'use', 'man', 'easy', 'thing', 'world', 'johnson', 'simply', 'say', 'mcbride', 'man', 'use', 'man', 'facility', 'congress', 'dress', 'woman', 'think', 'woman', 'question', 'johnson', 'think', 'republicans', 'need', 'accept', 'pretend', 'accept', 'underlying', 'premise', 'woke', 'left', 'wing', 'worldview', 'apparently', 'miss', 'vibe', 'shift', 'deliver', 'landslide', 'victory', 'president', 'elect', 'donald', 'trump', 'senate', 'house', 'republicans', 'unaware', 'trans', 'issue', 'giant', 'loser', 'people', 'slowly', 'back', 'away', 'want', 'overwhelming', 'number', 'americans', 'agree', 'transgender', 'issue', 'accord', 'recent', 'survey', 'percent', 'americans', 'think', 'illegal', 'child', 'age', 'puberty', 'blocker', 'gender', 'reassignment', 'surgery', 'percent', 'think', 'boy', 'allow', 'compete', 'girl', 'sport', 'percent', 'think', 'transgender', 'propaganda', 'teach', 'public', 'school', 'trump', 'won', 'republicans', 'majority', 'large', 'ad', 'trash', 'democrat', 'transgender', 'nonsense', 'resounding', 'victory', 'johnson', 'scared', 'come', 'state', 'plainly', 'man', 'allow', 'woman', 'bathroom', 'capitol', 'hill', 'sense', 'mercilessly', 'mock', 'weak', 'coward', 'johnson', 'quickly', 'convene', 'impromptu', 'press', 'conference', 'later', 'tuesday', 'clarify', 'walk', 'forward', 'early', 'remark', 'anybody', 'know', 'establish', 'record', 'issue', 'let', 'unequivocally', 'clear', 'man', 'man', 'woman', 'woman', 'man', 'woman', 'johnson', 'say', 'noise', 'treat', 'dignity', 'preface', 'remark', 'explain', 'reject', 'premise', 'early', 'question', 'mcbride', 'answer', 'obvious', 'reject', 'premise', 'simply', 'refuse', 'answer', 'uncomfortable', 'answer', 'original', 'question', 'mcbride', 'man', 'woman', 'want', 'reject', 'premise', 'answer', 'question', 'say', 'reject', 'premise', 'question', 'mcbride', 'man', 'matter', 'dress', 'call', 'attempt', 'unequivocally', 'clear', 'answer', 'specific', 'question', 'mcbride', 'man', 'woman', 'indicate', 'happen', 'mace', 'bill', 'hard', 'frankly', 'amazing', 'republican', 'house', 'speaker', 'flush', 'massive', 'electoral', 'victory', 'leave', 'executive', 'legislative', 'branch', 'government', 'gop', 'hand', 'come', 'january', 'fail', 'spectacularly', 'basic', 'question', 'single', 'republican', 'support', 'mace', 'measure', 'ban', 'man', 'woman', 'space', 'capitol', 'hill', 'board', 'shame', 'mock', 'throw', 'office', 'johnson', 'say', 'second', 'thought', 'mealy', 'mouthed', 'coward', 'afraid', 'call', 'mean', 'thing', 'corporate', 'press', 'mace', 'back', 'ask', 'tuesday', 'mace', 'say', 'feminist', 'make', 'extremist', 'totally', 'go', 'stand', 'man', 'know', 'penis', 'woman', 'locker', 'room', 'okay', 'trouble', 'mace', 'immediately', 'start', 'get', 'death', 'threat', 'tran', 'activist', 'say', 'want', 'find', 'woman', 'bathroom', 'kill', 'bash', 'face', 'floor', 'time', 'tolerate', 'insanity', 'americans', 'refuse', 'delusion', 'man', 'dress', 'like', 'woman', 'disturb', 'man', 'need', 'professional', 'help', 'demand', 'elect', 'leader', 'spine', 'issue', 'speaker', 'johnson', 'able', 'muster', 'tuesday']",
8f93d1b8-f029-4ecd-9d8f-87d8637ec370,anti,california democrats claim to protect kids while hiding gender ‘transitions’ from parents,"['california', 'democrats', 'claim', 'protect', 'kid', 'hide', 'gender', 'transition', 'parent']",the federalist,andrew davenport,https://thefederalist.com/2024/11/07/california-democrats-claim-to-protect-kids-while-hiding-gender-transitions-from-parents/,11/7/2024,"while governor gavin newsom touts his new social media law as a landmark achievement for protecting kids online, california democrats’ recent voting record indicates that safeguarding kids is not a priority for newsom or his party.  

senate bill 976 (introduced by democrat nancy skinner), which newsom signed into law last month, bans online platforms from “knowingly providing” addictive content feeds to minors “without parental consent.” in a statement accompanying the bill signing, newsom bragged, “with this bill, california is helping protect children and teenagers from purposely designed features that feed these destructive habits. i thank senator skinner for advancing this important legislation that puts children’s well-being first.” 

while newsom’s backing of the bill made headlines, the democrat majority has refused to consider numerous other child protection proposals this legislative session and has even pushed through one bill that puts many young people at risk. the party has not earned its rhetoric as a champion of children’s well-being.

a notable example is sb 1435 (introduced by republican ochoa bogh), which sought to support the removal of obscene materials from k-8 classrooms and school libraries by aligning california law with federal broadcasting standards. this innocuous bill to make educational environments safer for young students failed to pass beyond the senate education committee. three democrat senators opposed the measure, dismissing it as a “book-banning” bill.

yet if materials are deemed inappropriate for a general audience under federal broadcasting rules, it stands to reason they should also be considered inappropriate for children, especially in k-8 educational settings. another bill, ab 3080 (introduced by republican juan alanis), proposed to strengthen online protections for children by requiring businesses that offer products or services that are illegal for minors, such as pornography, to verify users’ age with government-issued id.

despite passing unanimously in the assembly and facing no opposition in the senate judiciary committee, ab 3080 was halted by the senate appropriations committee chaired by democrat sen. anna caballero, who effectively killed the bill by leaving it on the committee’s suspense file. 

but democrats’ greatest hypocrisy by far is claiming to care about “parental consent” when it comes to online content as they work overtime to kill the parental notification policies enacted by local school boards. these policies arose after a growing number of parents reported that schools were lying to them about their children changing their names and gender at school.

one particularly egregious example occurred in the newport-mesa school district in orange county, where last year a parental rights group “obtained hundreds of pages of emails and documents” showing that the district was involved in the social gender “transitioning” of 23 students — “eight of them elementary school age” — without informed parental consent from 2020 to 2022. 

in response to incidents like these, over a dozen california school districts passed policies requiring schools to notify parents of any changes to their child’s official or unofficial records. california attorney general rob bonta has targeted school districts that adopted these policies, most notably suing chino valley unified for implementing the first parental notification policy. litigation on this issue continues in several cases in both state and federal court.

rather than waiting for ongoing litigation to resolve, democrats in the legislature pushed through ab 1955 (introduced by democrat chris ward), which bans districts from adopting parental notification policies, and ostensibly allows school districts to create and maintain separate — and often secret — files or “unofficial records” for students, intentionally concealing information from parents. 

but ab 1955 defies federal law that requires parents to have complete access to their children’s school records at all times. legal challenges to the new law are expected before it goes into effect in january.

how can democrats champion parental involvement for online platforms but condemn it when it comes to something as life-altering as gender “transitioning?”

will o’neill, mayor of newport beach, captured the absurdity of the democrats’ stance perfectly: “in other words, [attorney general rob bonta] wants a kid to get parent consent before joining instagram, but not before changing gender.”

california voters should recognize the gap between the democrats’ rhetoric on the new social media law and their actions when it comes to protecting children. they want to be seen as staunch champions of children’s safety. but this image crumbles under the slightest scrutiny.","['governor', 'gavin', 'newsom', 'tout', 'new', 'social', 'medium', 'law', 'landmark', 'achievement', 'protect', 'kid', 'online', 'california', 'democrats', 'recent', 'voting', 'record', 'indicate', 'safeguard', 'kid', 'priority', 'newsom', 'party', 'senate', 'bill', 'introduce', 'democrat', 'nancy', 'skinner', 'newsom', 'sign', 'law', 'month', 'ban', 'online', 'platform', 'knowingly', 'provide', 'addictive', 'content', 'feed', 'minor', 'parental', 'consent', 'statement', 'accompany', 'bill', 'signing', 'newsom', 'brag', 'bill', 'california', 'help', 'protect', 'child', 'teenager', 'purposely', 'design', 'feature', 'feed', 'destructive', 'habit', 'thank', 'senator', 'skinner', 'advance', 'important', 'legislation', 'put', 'child', 'newsom', 'backing', 'bill', 'headline', 'democrat', 'majority', 'refuse', 'consider', 'numerous', 'child', 'protection', 'proposal', 'legislative', 'session', 'push', 'bill', 'put', 'young', 'people', 'risk', 'party', 'earn', 'rhetoric', 'champion', 'child', 'notable', 'example', 'sb', 'introduce', 'republican', 'ochoa', 'bogh', 'seek', 'support', 'removal', 'obscene', 'material', 'classroom', 'school', 'library', 'align', 'california', 'law', 'federal', 'broadcasting', 'standard', 'innocuous', 'bill', 'educational', 'environment', 'safe', 'young', 'student', 'fail', 'pass', 'senate', 'education', 'committee', 'democrat', 'senator', 'oppose', 'measure', 'dismiss', 'book', 'ban', 'bill', 'material', 'deem', 'inappropriate', 'general', 'audience', 'federal', 'broadcasting', 'rule', 'stand', 'reason', 'consider', 'inappropriate', 'child', 'especially', 'educational', 'setting', 'bill', 'ab', 'introduce', 'republican', 'juan', 'alanis', 'propose', 'strengthen', 'online', 'protection', 'child', 'require', 'business', 'offer', 'product', 'service', 'illegal', 'minor', 'pornography', 'verify', 'user', 'age', 'government', 'issue', 'despite', 'pass', 'unanimously', 'assembly', 'face', 'opposition', 'senate', 'judiciary', 'committee', 'ab', 'halt', 'senate', 'appropriations', 'committee', 'chair', 'democrat', 'sen', 'anna', 'caballero', 'effectively', 'kill', 'bill', 'leave', 'committee', 'suspense', 'file', 'democrats', 'great', 'hypocrisy', 'far', 'claim', 'care', 'parental', 'consent', 'come', 'online', 'content', 'work', 'overtime', 'kill', 'parental', 'notification', 'policy', 'enact', 'local', 'school', 'board', 'policy', 'arise', 'grow', 'number', 'parent', 'report', 'school', 'lie', 'child', 'change', 'name', 'gender', 'school', 'particularly', 'egregious', 'example', 'occur', 'newport', 'mesa', 'school', 'district', 'orange', 'county', 'year', 'parental', 'right', 'group', 'obtain', 'hundred', 'page', 'email', 'document', 'show', 'district', 'involve', 'social', 'gender', 'transitioning', 'student', 'elementary', 'school', 'age', 'informed', 'parental', 'consent', 'response', 'incident', 'like', 'dozen', 'california', 'school', 'district', 'pass', 'policy', 'require', 'school', 'notify', 'parent', 'change', 'child', 'official', 'unofficial', 'record', 'california', 'attorney', 'general', 'rob', 'bonta', 'target', 'school', 'district', 'adopt', 'policy', 'notably', 'sue', 'chino', 'valley', 'unify', 'implement', 'parental', 'notification', 'policy', 'litigation', 'issue', 'continue', 'case', 'state', 'federal', 'court', 'wait', 'ongoing', 'litigation', 'resolve', 'democrats', 'legislature', 'push', 'ab', 'introduce', 'democrat', 'chris', 'ward', 'ban', 'district', 'adopt', 'parental', 'notification', 'policy', 'ostensibly', 'allow', 'school', 'district', 'create', 'maintain', 'separate', 'secret', 'file', 'unofficial', 'record', 'student', 'intentionally', 'conceal', 'information', 'parent', 'ab', 'defy', 'federal', 'law', 'require', 'parent', 'complete', 'access', 'child', 'school', 'record', 'time', 'legal', 'challenge', 'new', 'law', 'expect', 'go', 'effect', 'january', 'democrat', 'champion', 'parental', 'involvement', 'online', 'platform', 'condemn', 'come', 'life', 'altering', 'gender', 'transition', 'mayor', 'newport', 'beach', 'capture', 'absurdity', 'democrats', 'stance', 'perfectly', 'word', 'attorney', 'general', 'rob', 'bonta', 'want', 'kid', 'parent', 'consent', 'join', 'instagram', 'change', 'gender', 'california', 'voter', 'recognize', 'gap', 'democrats', 'rhetoric', 'new', 'social', 'medium', 'law', 'action', 'come', 'protect', 'child', 'want', 'see', 'staunch', 'champion', 'child', 'safety', 'image', 'crumble', 'slight', 'scrutiny']",

in the back seat, a woman held a toddler close to her and desperately pleaded with the people surrounding their car to let them proceed. meanwhile, the transgender mob remained in place and demanded money as they yelled expletives at the family and laughed.

the woman had made the simple mistake of feeling sympathy and offering money to one of them while her car was stopped at a traffic light, apparently signaling to the others nearby that they were a soft target for extortion. our local tour guide, naveen, informed us that the group likely would not let that car go until its members had collected a satisfactory amount of money for each person around the car. naveen also noted that such incidents involving aggressive transgender mobs are commonplace in delhi.
biden’s united states is the surrounded car in delhi

these scenes on the streets of delhi encapsulate what we have been experiencing in the united states on a grand scale. morally relativistic, the trans activist population — which notably does not include all trans-identifying people — is strategically weaponizing kindness to extort their fellow americans at the expense of women’s rights, parents’ rights, and religious freedoms.

americans tend to agree that bullying is wrong and value a “live and let live” society. but a tyrannical minority pushed a conversation that started as a plea for liberty into something much different. the trans cult, made up of mostly bored white women, is an extremely small segment of the american population with a disproportionately loud voice.

meanwhile, the majority of americans believe that “gender is determined by sex at birth,” and they overwhelmingly oppose mutilative surgeries and medical interventions for children.

but before americans knew what was happening, between 2019 and 2023, nearly 14,000 children in the united states underwent transgender interventions. meanwhile, the trans activists continue to insist on the gender ideology indoctrination of our children in public schools, a takeover of women’s sports and bathrooms, and compelled speech with mandated pronouns.

for years, anyone who questioned or publicly disagreed with this agenda was villainized, and in some cases, canceled.
the trans cult can never get enough

the multitude of days and months celebrating transgenderism was not enough for the alphabet people. so, multiple governing bodies at all levels, including the biden administration, explicitly commemorated easter as “transgender visibility day.”

meanwhile, at the white house, a transgender flag was featured more prominently than the american flag at a “pride” event on june 10, 2023. and at that particular event, a transgender influencer decided the white house was an appropriate place to expose fake breasts, which was just one more way for biden to let us know that, without a doubt, the inmates were running the asylum.

and let us not forget the debacle of the biden administration’s dei political appointments, some of whom were chosen for their transgender identity in spite of their obvious mental health problems. sam brinton, for example, who identifies as “non-binary” and was likely picked to be a biden senior department of energy nuclear official because of that identification, was traveling at the taxpayers’ expense and stealing luggage from airports.
moving forward

much like the sympathetic family in the surrounded car in delhi, americans are a kind people. even in our most populated cities, we offer directions to strangers when asked and tend to value kindness above most other traits. but to people who have an agenda and seem to lack a moral code, kindness is easily exploited.

moving forward, we would do well to follow naveen’s advice. he suggested that while in india, we should avoid eye contact with the transgender mob, vendors, and beggars and go about our business.

just like the trans mob in delhi, narcissistic trans activists in the united states have proven that they will exploit us and take attention and resources at the expense of all other groups. it is time for us to push their absurd activist agenda out of our schools, bathrooms, and sports and then roll forward.","['month', 'stick', 'delhi', 'traffic', 'magnificent', 'tour', 'india', 'golden', 'triangle', 'compose', 'delhi', 'agra', 'jaipur', 'witness', 'troubling', 'scene', 'smog', 'occur', 'air', 'quality', 'index', 'time', 'maximum', 'level', 'deem', 'healthy', 'watch', 'vehicle', 'window', 'half', 'dozen', 'trans', 'identify', 'adult', 'surround', 'harass', 'family', 'car', 'forbid', 'forward', 'traffic', 'creep', 'seat', 'woman', 'hold', 'toddler', 'close', 'desperately', 'plead', 'people', 'surround', 'car', 'let', 'proceed', 'transgender', 'mob', 'remain', 'place', 'demand', 'money', 'yell', 'expletive', 'family', 'laugh', 'woman', 'simple', 'mistake', 'feel', 'sympathy', 'offer', 'money', 'car', 'stop', 'traffic', 'light', 'apparently', 'signal', 'nearby', 'soft', 'target', 'extortion', 'local', 'tour', 'guide', 'naveen', 'inform', 'group', 'likely', 'let', 'car', 'member', 'collect', 'satisfactory', 'money', 'person', 'car', 'naveen', 'note', 'incident', 'involve', 'aggressive', 'transgender', 'mob', 'commonplace', 'delhi', 'biden', 'united', 'states', 'surround', 'car', 'delhi', 'scene', 'street', 'delhi', 'encapsulate', 'experience', 'united', 'states', 'grand', 'scale', 'morally', 'relativistic', 'trans', 'activist', 'population', 'notably', 'include', 'trans', 'identify', 'people', 'strategically', 'weaponize', 'kindness', 'extort', 'fellow', 'americans', 'expense', 'woman', 'right', 'parent', 'right', 'religious', 'freedom', 'americans', 'tend', 'agree', 'bullying', 'wrong', 'value', 'live', 'let', 'live', 'society', 'tyrannical', 'minority', 'push', 'conversation', 'start', 'plea', 'liberty', 'different', 'trans', 'cult', 'bored', 'white', 'woman', 'extremely', 'small', 'segment', 'american', 'population', 'disproportionately', 'loud', 'voice', 'majority', 'americans', 'believe', 'gender', 'determine', 'sex', 'birth', 'overwhelmingly', 'oppose', 'mutilative', 'surgery', 'medical', 'intervention', 'child', 'americans', 'know', 'happen', 'nearly', 'child', 'united', 'states', 'undergo', 'transgender', 'intervention', 'trans', 'activist', 'continue', 'insist', 'gender', 'ideology', 'indoctrination', 'child', 'public', 'school', 'takeover', 'woman', 'sport', 'bathroom', 'compel', 'speech', 'mandate', 'pronoun', 'year', 'question', 'publicly', 'disagree', 'agenda', 'villainize', 'case', 'cancel', 'trans', 'cult', 'multitude', 'day', 'month', 'celebrate', 'transgenderism', 'alphabet', 'people', 'multiple', 'govern', 'body', 'level', 'include', 'biden', 'administration', 'explicitly', 'commemorate', 'easter', 'transgender', 'visibility', 'day', 'white', 'house', 'transgender', 'flag', 'feature', 'prominently', 'american', 'flag', 'pride', 'event', 'june', 'particular', 'event', 'transgender', 'influencer', 'decide', 'white', 'house', 'appropriate', 'place', 'expose', 'fake', 'breast', 'way', 'biden', 'let', 'know', 'doubt', 'inmate', 'run', 'asylum', 'let', 'forget', 'debacle', 'biden', 'administration', 'dei', 'political', 'appointment', 'choose', 'transgender', 'identity', 'spite', 'obvious', 'mental', 'health', 'problem', 'sam', 'brinton', 'example', 'identify', 'non', 'binary', 'likely', 'pick', 'biden', 'senior', 'department', 'energy', 'nuclear', 'official', 'identification', 'travel', 'taxpayer', 'expense', 'steal', 'luggage', 'airport', 'move', 'forward', 'like', 'sympathetic', 'family', 'surround', 'car', 'delhi', 'americans', 'kind', 'people', 'populated', 'city', 'offer', 'direction', 'stranger', 'ask', 'tend', 'value', 'kindness', 'trait', 'people', 'agenda', 'lack', 'moral', 'code', 'kindness', 'easily', 'exploit', 'move', 'forward', 'follow', 'naveen', 'advice', 'suggest', 'india', 'avoid', 'eye', 'contact', 'transgender', 'mob', 'vendor', 'beggar', 'business', 'like', 'trans', 'mob', 'delhi', 'narcissistic', 'tran', 'activist', 'united', 'states', 'prove', 'exploit', 'attention', 'resource', 'expense', 'group', 'time', 'push', 'absurd', 'activist', 'agenda', 'school', 'bathroom', 'sport', 'roll', 'forward']",

9176a92d-9db3-4891-a38f-ece9cfcad287,anti,data show there’s no ‘epidemic of violence’ against trans people,"['datum', 'epidemic', 'violence', 'trans', 'people']",the federalist,chad felix greene,https://thefederalist.com/2024/12/11/data-show-theres-no-epidemic-of-violence-against-trans-people/,12/11/2024,"in 2024 there were no reported murders of a trans-identifying person due to anti-trans bias in the united states. this might be a surprise, based on the routine headlines declaring that violence against transgender americans is only getting worse. the human rights campaign, one of the more prominent lgbt advocacy organizations, provides a list each year of reported murders of trans-identifying people.

discussing the death of quanesha shantel, human rights campaign director of community engagement for the transgender justice initiative tori cooper argued, “it’s time for communities across this country to reckon with the fact that their silence makes them complicit. hateful stereotypes, rhetoric and legislation fuels violence against transgender people.” this despite shantel, whose legal name was juquan hamilton, being allegedly murdered by his former romantic partner, jeremy reynolds, who reportedly was furious over their recent breakup.

on nov. 20, 2024, president joe biden put out a statement saying, “today, on transgender day of remembrance, we mourn the transgender americans whose lives were taken this year in horrific acts of violence. there should be no place for hate in america — and yet too many transgender americans, including young people, are cruelly targeted and face harassment simply for being themselves.”

this message was repeated by dozens of democrats the same day. rep. pramila jayapal, d-wash., mourned, “too many transgender people have been killed just for living as their true, authentic selves.” jayapal, the co-chair of the congressional equality caucus’ transgender equality task force, noted a supposed alarming rise in anti-trans violence due to intensifying rhetoric and legislation targeting the trans community. sen. mazie hirono, d-hawaii, asserted, “no one should have to live their lives in fear simply for existing as they are.”
looking at each case

yet, when evaluating the data, despite the broader reported statistics listed by the hrc, the claims about anti-trans violence are not true.

looking at each of 29 such reported cases in 2024, the three most common categories are domestic violence (6), altercations (6), and accidents (4). of all cases, four did not have sufficient information reported by authorities to make a determination on what kind of violence occurred. the deaths also included a suicide, the highly publicized death of dagny (nex) benedict, a victim of a mass shooting, and a random act of violence.

kita bee and honee daniels were both killed in what hrc calls “hit-and-run” accidents — they involved negligent behavior and both drivers have been arrested. jazlynn johnson, 18, was allegedly accidentally shot and killed by his friend, 17-year-old cesar sandoval, while showing off a new gun, according to reports.

finally, santonio coleman, who identified as a gay man who sometimes dressed as a woman, was found dead on a park trail, but he may have fallen, and no suspects have been identified. the headline reporting coleman’s death states, “family shocked after loved one brutally killed while walking on popular trail in athens,” despite no current indications from police investigating the incident that coleman was attacked.

the “altercation” category of reports indicates a fight occurred in which a trans-identifying person was killed. a transgender man, righteous tk hill, was allegedly shot by his cousin, jaylen hill, in an argument. robert clark jr., named as yella clark, was killed in a prison fight. clark was serving life in prison for the murder of another inmate while he was serving a 75-year sentence for armed robbery.

a 20-year-old named dylan gurley was reportedly stabbed to death in a dispute over money while staying in an abandoned house with a fellow homeless person, michael tooley. another trans-identifying person listed, known only as redd or barbie, was killed by an unknown assailant in a mass shooting on a street corner while talking with several other people. another homeless person, andrea doria dos passos, was attacked while sleeping by another homeless person in what appears to be a random assault; police have not reported a motive. the suspect has been charged.
interpersonal violence’s role

lgbt activists are aware that most murders of trans-identifying people involve domestic violence. the hrc reports, “tragically, interpersonal violence accounts for a significant number of fatalities against transgender and gender expansive people.” yet they insist on blaming hate and bigotry for these deaths. the hrc states, “in all cases, it remains clear that the intersections of racism, sexism, homophobia, biphobia, and transphobia conspire to place the trans community at risk of fatal violence.”

despite 82 percent of known suspects in the deaths of black trans-identifying individuals being black themselves, based on an evaluation of the reported cases, the hrc demands, “young trans women of color — particularly black trans women, continue to be disproportionately affected.”

year after year, these reports end up the same. domestic violence, interpersonal fights, random violence, and, more frequently, complete accidents, make up the majority of reported deaths of trans-identified people. hate crimes do occur — they are simply very rare, upon review of reported cases.

unfortunately, the constant repetition of this false narrative, always using alarming language and insisting on placing the blame politically, creates an environment of fear and hatred in the lgbt community. it sends a message that transgender identity is a privileged status that demands special protections from the government and the public. when every reported violent death of a trans-identifying person is elevated as a social failure requiring national mourning and outrage, the impact of real hate crimes is diminished.

no, a death is not more tragic because the person who died identified as transgender in some way. the media have a responsibility to report on these incidents honestly. yet, without fail, article after article connects one trans-identifying person’s death with others’, with a quote from an lgbtq advocacy group demanding justice, creating the illusion of a larger problem. it’s intentional and it must continue to be called out.

with more than a decade of evidence, data, and research, it is very clear there is no “epidemic of violence” against transgender people and lgbt activists know it. they simply choose to keep lying about it for political gain.","['report', 'murder', 'trans', 'identify', 'person', 'anti', 'trans', 'bias', 'united', 'states', 'surprise', 'base', 'routine', 'headline', 'declare', 'violence',

de5e3780-7eb8-4e89-8fbf-878ab3864263,anti,trump isn’t ‘denationalizing’ trans people. he’s saying no to their war on reality,"['trump', 'denationalize', 'trans', 'people', 'say', 'war', 'reality']",the federalist,joshua monnington,https://thefederalist.com/2025/03/21/trump-isnt-denationalizing-trans-people-hes-saying-no-to-their-war-on-reality/,3/21/2025,"early this week, new york times opinion columnist masha gessen penned a piece purportedly exposing “the hidden motive behind trump’s attacks on trans people.” unsurprisingly, the trump policies gessen sees as proof of an insidious trumpian plot are reality-based measures that protect women and children and preserve american culture.

gessen begins her supposed exposé by bemoaning the “current, protracted bad-news moment” and its repercussions for her “personally” as someone who is “trans and an immigrant.” she then moves quickly to comparing the united states to nazi germany and the soviet union. as the essay continues, gessen’s contention becomes clear: trump’s “barrage of attacks on trans people” is central to his “denationalization campaign,” which he pursues ostensibly so he can then deport them or implement a more fiendishly hitlerian purpose.

gessen likens trans people in america to jews in europe during the holocaust and tells the story of a “nonbinary” friend who felt the need to hide her star of david necklace when an alleged “attacker” questioned whether she was “a girl or a boy,” implying a link between antisemitism and traditional, biology-based views of sex. in other words, the united states has become like 1930s germany, and those who refuse to accept the left’s gender ideology are the 21st century’s nazis.

as evidence, gessen cites trump’s “assert[ion] that only two sexes exist;” “executive orders aimed at banning any mention of transgender people in schools, banning trans athletes from women’s sports, ordering a stop to gender-affirming medical care for people under 19 and barring trans people from serving in the military;” the elimination of the “x” designation on u.s. passports; and “visa guidelines” that require the sex designation on a person’s passport to match that on his birth certificate, among others.

in other words, from gessen’s perspective — and apparently that of the new york times — the most compelling evidence that the trump administration is an authoritarian regime akin to the third reich or the soviet union is its acknowledgment of biological and cultural realities and moral laws. gessen characterizes trump’s acceptance of the fact that “only two sexes exist: male and female, established at conception and immutable” as an assertion that “trans people … do not exist.” trump referencing payton mcnabb and her being injured by a trans-identifying male during his joint address to congress is an attack on trans people. (gessen downplays the injury by asserting that “serious volleyball injuries are surprisingly common,” though evidence suggests that volleyball is one of the safer sports.)

while gessen may believe her own fearmongering, her conspiracy theory is ridiculous and unfounded. (perhaps gessen’s conspiratorial thinking should be unsurprising, given that she actually suggested that kamala harris’ refusal to double down on pro-trans policies cost her the election.) u.s. citizens who identify as transgender, nonbinary, and so forth (and so forth, as the identities multiply) are in no danger of being deported or alienated from society. trump isn’t denying the existence of people who claim to be transgender; he’s just stating the fact that such people do not transcend the biological and cultural realities of male and female.

the whole trans-activist accusation of existence-denial is nonsensical in any case: it’s fairly obvious that if a man claims to be a “smart scientist” and another man disagrees with him, he’s denying the man’s claim, not his existence (otherwise, whose claim is he disagreeing with?). a female who switches from identifying as male to identifying as nonbinary didn’t commit suicide.

despite gessen’s protests and all the headlines implying that trump is kicking trans people out of sports, no trump policy does any such thing. those who claim to be transgender are allowed to play sports with other people of the same sex — just like everyone else. a boy can try to look, act, and sound like a girl and still play sports — on the boys’ sports teams.

when it comes to passports, gessen seems to ignore the fact that passports (and other forms of id) have photographs for identification purposes, not just an m for male or an f for female. passport photos are supposed to be recent when submitted, but they can be updated to reflect a drastic change in appearance, rendering the objection to the removal of the x designation a red herring. if all else fails, the individual can simply explain why his passport says he is male but he is attempting to look like a woman (an uncomfortable conversation for some, perhaps, but one that was chosen by the individual identifying as transgender). trump isn’t prohibiting the travel of people like gessen.

the trump administration’s common sense policies are simply a reflection of the truth that government has a role in preserving culture (or, in the case of the biden administration, destroying it). that role exists even if it is as limited as ensuring that the passports it issues tell the truth about the carrier’s sex instead of legitimizing his confusion. viewed through this lens, the policies gessen decries have nothing to do with targeting those who claim to be transgender — and certainly nothing to do with “denationalizing” them — and everything to do with acknowledging the truths about reality that form the bedrock of this nation and its cultural norms.

trans activists, on the other hand, are perfectly willing to destroy america’s cultural fabric in order to replace it with their own distorted framework — a framework in which the concepts of male and female exist, not as biological and cultural realities established by a creator, but as malleable categories whose primary purpose is transgender cosplay. gessen herself argued that the institution of marriage should be done away with in 2012, in part because marriage wasn’t “compatible” with her relationship arrangement. (her “new partner” at the time had just given birth to her brother’s child, among other “incompatibilities.”)

a more recent example of trans anarchism was brought to light by an illinois mother who claimed that her 13-year-old daughter’s school made female students undress in front of a male student. trans activists booed the mother for speaking out at a school board meeting, and the school disputes the mother’s claim. but even if the mother’s story were completely false, that wouldn’t change the fact that schools requiring girls to undress in front of boys (or men) is exactly what trans anarchists want — the total obliteration of boundaries and norms rooted in immutable distinctions between male and female.

trump opposes this imposition of cultural anarchy. his resistance is not based on a desire to render those who claim to be transgender nationless, but, apparently, on a recognition that this cultural anarchy if left unchecked will ultimately lead to the demise of the nation all americans call their home. thus trump’s emphasis in his joint address to congress on the realities that a person is either male or female and “every child” is “perfect exactly the way god made” him or her. gessen and those who share her belief system are in no danger of losing their country, but all americans are in danger of having it undermined by a radical trans agenda that brooks no dissent.

interestingly, in a 2023 interview with the new yorker, gessen discussed her parents’ response to her using a boy’s name and telling them she planned “to have an operation when i grow up.”

“my parents, fortunately, were incredibly game. they were totally fine with it,” gessen said.

trump isn’t “denationalizing” trans people. he’s simply telling radical trans activists what gessen’s parents should have told her a long time ago: no.","['early', 'week', 'new', 'york', 'times',

1e8a8720-ad5d-4307-9b6d-9ad28e859e5c,anti,"in the transgender culture war, leftists fired the first shot","['transgender', 'culture', 'war', 'leftist', 'fire', 'shot']",the federalist,kylee griswold,https://thefederalist.com/2023/04/18/in-the-transgender-culture-war-leftists-fired-the-first-shot/,4/18/2023,"the transgender culture war sure has taken off since those ornery conservatives, snubbed by obergefell, grabbed hold of the issue and thrust it into the spotlight and down the throats of americans everywhere — so say the media.

it wasn’t a misprint, a babylon bee joke, or one of sonny hostin’s brainless musings. this claim came from none other than paper-of-record the new york times, which attempted to make the case that after conservatives lost the same-sex marriage fight at the supreme court in 2015, “the religious right went searching for an issue that would re-energize supporters and donors,” and found it in the great transgender debate. in other words, republicans needed a new red-meat issue they could toss to the base in exchange for donations and energized voters. and though bewildered leftists “are still uncertain about how to best navigate the fraught politics of transgender issues,” write authors adam nagourney and jeremy w. peters, the conservatives who birthed the whole trans controversy have got their cold-hearted strategy down. 

the article is pure propaganda. besides calling the right’s pushback against science-denial and the sterilization of kids an “effort to restrict transgender rights” and a “focus on perceived threats to impressionable children,” the piece cites a media matters activist who declares without evidence that these efforts are a product of “general animus” toward transgender-identifying people. (it also lies about the removal of both pornographic books from children’s shelves — “banning books” — and racially divisive critical race theory from taxpayer-funded curricula — “curriculums that teach about racism”).

“the effort started with a smattering of republican lawmakers advancing legislation focused on transgender girls’ participation in school sports,” the authors write.

while the whole piece is so blatantly dishonest that it belongs on a trash heap rather than dissected and amplified with a retort, this main argument — that the transgender culture war started with republicans — is gaining steam on the left and must be confronted.

here’s an unsurprisingly unamusing “saturday night live” segment out the same day featuring molly kearney, introduced as “‘snl’s’ first nonbinary cast member,” who floated in like a woke and unfunny female reincarnation of chris farley.

“there are now over 14 states that have passed bills restricting health care for trans kids,” said “weekend update” host michael che, teeing up the segment.

“listen to that, michael. restricting health care for kids. for some reason, there’s something about the word ‘trans’ that makes people forget the word’ kids.’ if you don’t care about trans kids’ lives, it means you don’t care about frickin’ kids’ lives,” responded kearney robotically to audience “clapter.” kearney went on to imply it’s gop lawmakers who are trying to interfere with kids just being kids.

did you catch that? republicans are the ones “restricting” trans folks and interfering with childhood innocence. the message from “snl” and nyt is the same: in the midst of a cultural vacuum, conservatives fired the first shot.

make no mistake, this is the left’s strategy in the frontier of sexual deviance: push the radical envelope until conservatives enter the fray, and then pretend those conservatives conjured up a cultural rift out of thin air and executed an unprovoked sneak attack.

this exact strategy played out over the nashville shooting. recall that just weeks ago, a transgender-identified shooter blasted her way into a christian school and murdered three 9-year-old children and three staff members in cold blood. how did the media respond? not with reflection on how gender dysphoria converges with other mental health issues. no introspection on how mutilating young men or pumping young women full of testosterone might contribute to erratic aggression. there was no talk of the shooter’s manifesto nor the fact that law enforcement characterized the murder of these christians as a “targeted attack.”

instead, the media focused on how “drag shows and gender-affirming care for minors were banned in tennessee,” hanging the responsibility on republican lawmakers. premier newspapers left the words “christian,” “transgender,” and “targeted” out of their unsensational headlines. nbc news had the gall to make transgender-identified people the primary victims: “fear pervades tennessee’s trans community amid focus on nashville shooter’s gender identity.” the biden administration declared a “trans day of visibility” to stand up to the hate-mongering conservatives who allegedly want to “erase” trans people. it was gaslighting at its finest and sent the same unified message about conservatives being the real villains.

[related: fixed it for you: here’s what the vilest headlines about the nashville school shooting should have said] 

so it’s par for the course when corporate media propagandists declare “the religious right went searching” for the transgender culture war post-obergefell, no matter how absurd the claim. yes, because it’s totally believable that conservatives were fine with amputating healthy genitals before 2015, but overnight they galvanized against sexual appendage choppery. good work, new york times.

but understand the bigger picture. with the propaganda press, it’s all about narrative building and memory holing. the trans culture war must be pinned on republicans because it can’t be pinned on municipal employees who usher drag queens into children’s libraries and local pride parades. or male athletes such as lia thomas, who force biological females to see their privates in women’s locker rooms and then blow them out of the water with superior lung capacity, wingspan, and bone density. or jazz jennings and other authors of pro-confusion children’s books. or corporate “equity” initiatives that inject mentally ill cross-dressers into advertising and branding for every item americans consume. or taxpayer-funded educators and educrats who brainwashed a generation of college grads with radical gender theory that trickled down directly into k-12 classrooms and curricula.

it can’t be the fault of leftist politicians such as the incumbent president, who seized on confused kids to garner votes and normalize so-called “trans youth.” or planned parenthood and other leftist behemoths that identified a goldmine in wrong-sex hormones and pivoted to experimenting on kids for profit. or alleged medical professionals who tout a “consensus” on wrongly named “gender-affirming care” that’s really just handed down from trans-motivated ideologues at the world professional association for transgender health. or same-sex adoptive parents who fail to model healthy sex distinctions by denying children their god-given right to a mother and father. or other unhinged parents who catechize their kids in lgbt orthodoxy or welcome “theybies” into a world of disorder.

[read: this is your sign to catechize your kids — and yourself]

if the new york times really wants to talk about obergefell, this is a great place to do it — not because it was the catalyst for some right-wing anti-trans crusade, but because it toppled one of the first dominoes in the left’s war on sex and sexuality.

“i assume that those who cling to old beliefs will be able to whisper their thoughts in the recesses of their homes, but if they repeat those views in public, they will risk being labeled as bigots and treated as such by governments, employers, and schools,” wrote justice samuel alito in his obergefell dissent. “it will be used to vilify americans who are unwilling to assent to the new orthodoxy.”

as with obergefell, so with bostock and now the transgender legal battles of today. no, conservatives didn’t go “searching” for this fight. the left fired the first shot and has been relentlessly pillaging ever since. meanwhile, the battered right is triaging, surveying the casualties, and barely holding the fort.","['transgender', 'culture', 'war', 'sure', 'take', 'ornery', 'conservative',

but it is her claims that are false, often obviously so.

this dishonesty begins with her first claim, which is that “so-called ‘social contagion’ is not real and it does not make people trans.” she focuses her critique on lisa littman’s study describing the phenomenon of rapid-onset gender dysphoria. the research mcnamara cites in response is terrible, but this is beside the point because transgender identities are obviously socially contagious — no one needs social science reports to see this. after all, if transgenderism is a “natural state of being” resulting from “genetics and the brain’s structural development” then why can’t we diagnose transgender identities via genetic markers or mri rather than subjective self-evaluation, and why has transgender identification suddenly increased exponentially?

the usual excuse is that this enormous increase in transgender identities is the result of a more affirmative and accepting society — trans people were always here in these numbers but are only just now coming out. however, this claim destroys the suicide narrative that powers the transgender movement, which is that trans-identified people will kill themselves if they are not affirmed and medically transitioned on demand. after all, if current levels of youth trans identification are natural, where were all the suicides in the past, when there would have been far more unaffirmed and un-transitioned “trans kids”?

transgender ideology does not have a good answer for this, nor for other difficulties, such as why adolescent girls are suddenly claiming to be transgender in disproportionate numbers. despite the protests of mcnamara and others, social contagion is by far the best explanation for the transgender phenomenon. 

mcnamara’s next assertion is that “trans youth are not rushed through gender-affirming treatment.” she claims to rebut “wild misrepresentations of standard care, like the idea that ‘double mastectomies on 12-year-old girls’ is a common occurrence, or that gender-affirming care means kids being castrated. this all sounds too absurd to believe. and that’s because it’s not true.” 

yet she admits that double mastectomies for 12-year-olds are being done in the name of “gender-affirming care” — she just claims they are not “common.” with regard to castration, she is obviously lying, for that is literally what was done to reality tv star jazz jennings, the most famous “trans kid” in america. jennings was subjected to the intervention plan known as the dutch protocol — puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones, and genital surgery — and that meant castration, first chemical, then surgical.

this illuminates mcnamara’s two-step: it’s not happening, but when it does, it is carefully done and medically necessary. both parts of this are false. some children are being rushed into so-called medical transition, and it is never medically necessary to “transition” a child. thus, she retreats into appeals to authority, such as citing wpath (world professional association for transgender health). but this is not a respectable authority. rather, it is an activist group that has declared “eunuch” to be a valid identity to be affirmed, a decision it reached by relying on online forums filled with child sexual abuse fantasies. 

mcnamara’s third point is that “puberty blockers, hormones, and medical treatments for gender dysphoria are not ‘experimental.’” she asserts “that study after study establishes the benefits of gender-affirming care, which include increased body satisfaction, improved social functioning, hope for the future, and lower rates of depression, eating disorders, self-injury, and suicide.” but the very studies she cites disprove her claims.

she links to two studies, one of which is an infamous report from earlier this year that was a disaster for the transgender movement. as i observed in the federalist, two of the 315 subjects in the study died by suicide — not a positive result for a regimen that is justified as self-harm prevention. moreover, males involved in the study didn’t show any improvement in “depression and anxiety scores” or “scores for life satisfaction.” simply put, if pumping trans-identified males full of female hormones fails to improve their mental health, there’s no reason to continue giving them those hormones.

however, these devastating results were ignored to focus on some minor, self-reported mental health improvements among females given testosterone, even though these may have been due to cherry-picking data on the part of the research team. as this example shows, the research cited in support of wrongly named “gender-affirming care” is often low-quality as well as conducted by the same people whose livelihoods and reputations depend upon vindicating “gender-affirming care.” nonetheless, the transgender lobby and its allies boost it anyway in the hopes that no one will bother to check it.

when the research is rigorously examined, the flaws are quickly apparent, which is why multiple european nations have recently restricted so-called transition for children. contrary to mcnamara’s claim, they have declared it to be experimental.

mcnamara’s fourth point is that “using medications ‘off-label’ is neither uncommon nor unsafe.” this is a half-truth, that in this context is a full lie. yes, some off-label uses of medication are safe, but as she admits, using puberty blockers in response to gender dysphoria is not among them. she acknowledges that there are side effects (specifically, loss of bone density, though there are others) and so she shifts from arguing that they are safe to arguing that they are worth the risks. 

but the risks are all on one side. there is no physical danger from allowing normal, natural puberty. this is why trans activists always have to play the suicide card — the only harm that will befall them is self-harm.

mcnamara’s final assertion is that “it is exceedingly rare that people regret getting gender-affirming care.” to support this claim, she suggests that the significant rates of desistance (up to 30.8 percent) found in a recent study using data from the military health care system is “likely a reflection of the challenging health systems that young adults depend on.” her argument is that people discontinue supposedly life-saving care because they just can’t figure out how to renew a prescription or make a doctor’s appointment. it is easier for her to blame the health care system than to admit that maybe, just maybe, people regret being rushed into “affirmations” and radical, life-altering procedures.

mcnamara also relies on a flawed 2021 study that, among other problems, pooled data from a set of studies in which less than 20 percent of the studies used ranked as good or having a low risk of bias. this illustrates the common tactic used by transgender activists and their allies, which is to pile weak research together to make it appear more substantial. but more bad data is just more bad data.

nonetheless, we should expect more of this junk science and lies as transgender activists scramble to support their enthusiasm for maiming children. they have no choice but to lie and distort data because their fundamental position — that children are somehow being born into the wrong bodies, which therefore require radical alteration to resemble the other sex — is a ridiculous superstition.","['purveyor', 'child', 'sexual', 'mutilation', 'worried', 'fight', 'medically', 'transition', 'child', 'win', 'lot', 'year', 'transgender', 'lobby', 'respond', 'lie', 'example',

1edf5767-f579-427a-b7fa-3213f1291590,anti,transgender activists say your kids have a ‘right’ to carve up their bodies,"['transgender', 'activist', 'kid', 'right', 'carve', 'body']",the federalist,john daniel davidson,https://thefederalist.com/2024/03/13/transgender-activists-say-your-kids-have-a-right-to-carve-up-their-bodies/,3/13/2024,"if you pay attention to the transgender debate, it’s been obvious for a while now that the trans movement is interested in children. the specter of state lawmakers or even parents hindering or discouraging children from “transitioning” seems to haunt trans activists, who view recent political efforts to ban so-called “gender-affirming care” in some states as the worst sort of tyranny. children, in their view, have a right to transition, and any obstacle placed in their way, even by parents, is a gross injustice crying out for redress.

up until recently, this argument was simmering just below the surface of the transgender discourse in america. it was the subtext first of the bathroom debate, then of the debate over girls’ sports, then of the debate over the role teachers and public schools are playing in transing kids socially without informing parents, and finally of state laws restricting transgender surgeries, puberty blockers, and other treatments for minors. in each case, the unstated argument was that minors who believe they are trans should be allowed to transition, socially and medically, and no one, not even their parents, should have the right to stop them.

now that argument is out in the open — declared in bold black letters against a blood-red field on the latest cover of new york magazine: “freedom of sex, the moral case for letting trans kids change their bodies.”

the author of the piece is a man named andrea long chu, the magazine’s pulitzer prize-winning literary critic and a self-identified lesbian “trans woman,” who by his own admission was persuaded of this particular gender identity after becoming addicted to pornography — specifically to something called “sissy porn,” which encourages men to “feminize” and sexually humiliate themselves.

chu has probably done more than anyone else in recent years to mainstream transgenderism, mostly through his 2019 book, females, which chronicles his dark obsession with sissy porn. i won’t quote it here, but suffice it to say, it makes for unpleasant reading (even in small excerpts). to give you a sense of this person, he was aptly described by peachy keenan on twitter this week as “a radical trans activist who is an obese man who now calls himself a lesbian and has a neovagina.”

what better spokesman, then, for the idea that children should be allowed to undergo an array of surgical procedures and drug therapies, even against their parents’ wishes or without their knowledge. chu’s argument relies on holding up bizarre anecdotes and medical anomalies as normative and quoting radical gender theorists from the 1970s. the essay itself is weighed down with the intentionally opaque academic jargon of gender studies, which makes reading it an unhappy chore. so i’ll save you the trouble: his main point is that we need to jettison the idea that youth transgenderism is something that can be diagnosed by medical experts, that it requires one to meet any sort of criteria, and that it even has a cause. it is simply a fact of modern life that we must all accept.

“we will never be able to defend the rights of transgender kids until we understand them purely on their own terms: as full members of society who would like to change their sex,” he writes. “we must be prepared to defend the idea that, in principle, everyone should have access to sex-changing medical care, regardless of age, gender identity, social environment, or psychiatric history.”

this is a radical argument that carries an equally radical agenda. among other things, it means there is no point to the political debates now raging over girls’ sports, the legality of “gender-affirming care” for youth, and pretty much everything else related to the transgender movement. the “anti-trans bloc,” writes chu, has “targeted children because americans tend to imagine children both as a font of pure, unadulterated humanity and as ignorant dependents incapable of rational thought or political agency.”

never mind that children by definition are rightly incapable of political agency; they are in the charge of their parents, who exercise political agency on their behalf. nor are they entirely capable of rational thought, which is why we don’t allow them to vote or drink alcohol or get tattoos.

but such realities are brushed aside by chu, who insists that “the freedom to bring sex and gender into whatever relation one chooses is a basic human right,” and that we cannot deny this right to children.

interestingly, chu’s primary target here is liberals, not conservatives — readers of the new york times and the atlantic. he calls them “trans-agnostic reactionary liberal,” or tarls, whose primary concern is the illiberality of the trans movement itself and its habit of “trafficking in censorship, intimidation, and quasi-religious fanaticism. on trans people themselves, the tarl claims to take no position other than to voice his general empathy for anyone suffering from psychological distress or civil-rights violations.”

they err, he says, in supposing that there is any psychological distress behind a person’s desire to transition, or that transitioning is something we should tolerate for those who really need it but certainly not encourage. reconceiving of transgenderism as a basic human right means getting away from that kind of thinking and clearing the public square of these debates entirely.

in practice, he says, this means a kind of radical laissez-fair policy when it comes to things like castration and sterilization and the entire smorgasbord of “treatments” now on offer for those who identify as transgender. “let anyone change their sex,” says chu. “let anyone change their gender. let anyone change their sex again. let trans girls play sports, regardless of their sex status. if they excel, this means only that some girls are better at sports than others.”

there is something deeply wrong with the reasoning here, as if reality itself can offer no resistance to the ideology of self-creation that chu would enshrine in our polity. in the concluding paragraphs, he makes statements like, “[i]f children are too young to consent to puberty blockers, then they are definitely too young to consent to puberty, which is a drastic biological upheaval in its own right.”

the conflation of powerful drugs like puberty blockers with the natural process of puberty is not just a disfigurement of reason, it is an assault on the idea that there is a natural order at all. it is a claim of human will and desire over and against reality itself, an assault on the givenness of the created order. in secular terms, one might call it delusional or fantastic. in christian terms, one should rightly call it satanic. 

trans kids, writes chu, “are busy taking charge of their own creation” — that is, themselves. the idea that we can “create” ourselves is popular among trans activists, including ai-addled transhumanists. but it’s also popular among ordinary liberals and unreligious, uncatechized modern people who generally like the idea that we all make ourselves into what we are.

therein lies the strategy behind chu’s approach. he is appealing to a bias embedded in the liberal worldview, an assumption that we are not limited by a created order, much less a creator. it’s a clever ploy because, at the end of the day, liberals have no answer to this argument. they must accept its premise — that every person can create his own truth, and indeed has a right to his own truth — or fall back on some notion of natural law, which necessarily implies a created natural order and all that it entails.

chu and the trans movement for which he speaks are betting that liberals will not be able to resist what amounts to an extension of liberals’ own logic. they are betting, smartly, that most of them lack the theological vocabulary to apprehend the old lie from the garden, now disguised in the modern verbiage of rights and identities: you will not surely die, you will become like god.","['pay',

4ad1aa74-dfc5-4219-b9c7-4d13ec28bd74,anti,trans ideologues would rather revolt against reality than admit they were wrong,"['trans', 'ideologue', 'revolt', 'reality', 'admit', 'wrong']",the federalist,nathanael blake,https://thefederalist.com/2024/03/14/trans-ideologues-would-rather-revolt-against-reality-than-admit-they-were-wrong/,3/14/2024,"gender ideology has a reality problem. just look at the latest cover story for new york magazine, in which the trans-identified writer andrea long chu denounced reality itself, writing that “the belief that we have a moral duty to accept reality just because it is real is, i think, a fine definition of nihilism.”

well, that is a … novel philosophical assertion.

it is tempting to dismiss chu’s denunciation of reality as an insane gambit by a flailing ideology, but declaring war against reality might just be crazy enough to work. this approach provides the collapsing gender ideology movement a way out of myriad difficulties — instead of relying on shoddy science to support medical “transition,” including for children, gender ideologues can instead appeal to a supposed right to physical self-determination and modification, even for children. liberals like the idea of liberating mankind from the limits of our humanity, and so even as chu retreats from the usual arguments of gender ideology, he invites the left to join in this more radical vision.

this effort to find a better justification for gender ideology pushes chu to argue that it was a mistake for the left to hang “trans rights on the thin peg of gender identity.” this approach won some victories, but it “failed to form a coherent moral account of why someone’s gender identity should justify the actual biological interventions that make up gender-affirming care.” 

the radical bodily alterations of “gender-affirming care” have been justified by elevating “gender identity” to the status of a person’s essence, deeper and more real than the body itself. but people are realizing that a “gender identity” is metaphysical conjecture, not medicine or biology. thus, chu sees reliance on gender identity as a trap for transgender advocates. it is superstitious to imagine that there is something like gendered souls that sometimes, somehow, get stuck in the wrong bodies. 

he also sees that searching for reasons and explanations for transgenderism may prove deadly to the cause of gender ideology. by making the case for “transition” (again, especially for children) contingent on generating favorable evidence (medical, sociological, psychological) for it, the transgender movement has become more vulnerable as that evidence has failed to materialize. furthermore, requiring reasons for transition tends to establish some form of gatekeeping, in which transition is doled out only to those determined to be truly transgender. 

chu fears that subjecting the transgender movement, and especially its medical wing, to rational, evidence-based scrutiny will restrict and ultimately destroy it. instead, he wants transgender activists and their allies to:

    [s]top relying on the increasingly metaphysical concept of gender identity to justify sex-changing care, as if such care were only permissible when one’s biological sex does not match the serial number engraved on one’s soul. … [w]e must rid ourselves of the idea that any necessary relationship exists between sex and gender; this prepares us to claim that the freedom to bring sex and gender into whatever relation one chooses is a basic human right.

he thereby makes explicit what has always been the position of gender ideologues, which is that there should be medical transition on demand for everyone. he writes, “we must be prepared to defend the idea that, in principle, everyone should have access to sex-changing medical care, regardless of age, gender identity, social environment, or psychiatric history.” this is not about medical need, but about a subjective desire to flee from the reality of one’s embodied self.

as the recent release of the wpath files demonstrates, so-called “gender-affirming care” is not rigorous and evidence-based, but being made up on the fly and administered to children who cannot give informed consent to it. the medical case for transition is crumbling (and other nations are pulling back from it), but for those who are in too deep to back out, chu’s articulation of a more radical alternative may be appealing. it is, after all, what the activists already believe.

thus, they may now be drawn to chu’s assertion that “we will never be able to defend the rights of transgender kids until we understand them purely on their own terms: as full members of society who would like to change their sex. it does not matter where this desire comes from.” chu’s own so-called transition was sparked by the fetishes he developed from a porn addiction, so he has a personal reason to deny that there is any significance to why someone wants to transition.

instead of justifying transition as medically necessary based on the supposed psychological distress of not transitioning, chu insists upon a right to bodily modification for whatever reason and without regard for the results. he acknowledges that the biology of sex is real, but he just regards it as an enemy to be subdued and made subject to our whims. he writes that “any comprehensive movement for trans rights must be able to make political demands at the level of biology itself.” 

chu admits that this approach “does not promise happiness. nor should it. it is good and right for advocates to fight back against the liberal fixation on the health risks of sex-changing care or the looming possibility of detransition. but it is also true that where there is freedom, there will always be regret.” he continues, insisting, “if we are to recognize the rights of trans kids, we will also have to accept that, like us, they have a right to the hazards of their own free will.” 

that proclamation might sound reasonable to chu and his editors, but it is madness to anyone who actually cares about children and their well-being. good parenting requires a great deal of limiting children’s free will and the hazards it exposes them to.

ominously, chu is not the first to prominently insist that children should be transitioned without regard for the risks. lydia polgreen made a similar argument in the new york times last december, arguing that children should be transitioned regardless of whether they might regret it later. this argument absolves gender ideologues of all responsibility, even toward children who are incapable of understanding the consequences of their decisions. according to chu and polgreen’s doctrine, there is no need to prove that transition helps mental health or to worry about the side effects, complications, and regrets it may produce. all there is to do is cheer while enabling troubled children to make war against their natural, healthy bodies.

in this, chu is simply extending to children an argument he has made for years about adults. in a 2018 times piece shortly before he got genital surgery, he wrote, “this is what i want, but there is no guarantee it will make me happier. in fact, i don’t expect it to. that shouldn’t disqualify me from getting it.” chu claimed that the “surgery’s only prerequisite should be a simple demonstration of want” and that “no amount of pain, anticipated or continuing, justifies its withholding.” 

as ryan t. anderson observed at the time, chu regards doctors as mere technicians, paid to deliver the services the customer demands, regardless of whether the procedures help the patient. this idea of medicine is unconcerned with health, happiness, or any idea of human well-being — it doesn’t even care if transition increases the risk of suicide. all that matters, in this view, is that someone wants to transition. this argument is toxic even if applied only to adults, but chu is now explicitly arguing that it should extend to children, whose health, well-being, and lives he is willing to sacrifice to justify his choices and ideology.

he concludes that “trans kids … do not owe us an explanation. they are busy taking charge of their own creation. they may not change the world, but they will certainly change themselves.” this proclamation reveals the real heart of gender ideology, which is not medicine, but revolt. gender ideology is rooted in a hatred for the givenness of our existence. it longs for the god-like but unattainable power of self-creation. thus, it readily abdicates all responsibility toward children, for it sees guidance, instruction, and discipline as oppression. 

this is an inhuman ideology. the sudden prominence of chu’s radicalism may signal the imminent collapse of the gender ideology house of cards, especially regarding children. but this is not certain. some people will embrace even the most radical and repulsive ideas if the alternative is admitting they were wrong. that chu’s ideas are being published in influential places shows that elite liberals are at least considering them. 

it is difficult to reason with a revolt against reality itself. what can be done is to demonstrate that it is immiserating. a way of life that rejects happiness, health, and well-being in pursuit of an impossible rebellion against existence itself is self-refuting. we might even call it nihilistic.","['gender', 'ideology', 'reality', 'problem', 'look', 'late', 'cover', 'story', 'new', 'york',

9d6b16a1-c1cf-4f80-83fb-f7ffb0da4b2e,anti,why tiktok feminists lost the transgender fight before it even started,"['tiktok', 'feminist', 'lose', 'transgender', 'fight', 'start']",the federalist,evita duffy-alfonso,https://thefederalist.com/2023/05/24/why-tiktok-feminists-lost-the-transgender-fight-before-it-even-started/,5/24/2023,"conservatives have been sounding the alarm bells for years now, warning that the denial of the natural sex binary would have devastating cultural ramifications, particularly for women. we were right. men have invaded female spaces, taking away scholarships, awards, and opportunities from real women. 

more importantly, it has put women’s and girls’ safety on the line. no longer can females peacefully use a locker room or bathroom with the assurance that predatory men won’t be allowed inside. sorority girls are forced to live with disturbed and perverted men, and female prisoners are having abortifacient drugs distributed to them because they’re being raped and impregnated by “female-identifying” male inmates. 

a growing number of female leftists are realizing that the transgender movement hurts women. droves of young and progressive feminists are taking to tiktok to join the older generation of so-called “terfs” (trans-exclusionary radical feminists), such as j.k. rowling and germaine greer, decrying what they rightfully perceive as female erasure.

these younger feminists naturally take a page out of the only playbook they know. victimhood and name-calling are their weapon of choice. 

in one video, tiktoker angelene fratto prefaces by identifying as an “lgbtq community ally,” who has “many gay people in her family,” including a transgender sibling (as if that will somehow protect her from being labeled a transphobe). fratto states that she does not want the phrases “chestfeeding” or “birthing person” applied to her. however, she will use that delusional terminology for others if they ask her to. essentially, fratto weakly tries to defend femininity while massively compromising with those who are actively expunging it.  

in a similar vein, another woman who goes by the username luxgamma specifically calls out “trans white women” for their “misogyny.” she explains that terms like “chestfeeding” and phrases like “trans women get periods” contradict reality and science, and she describes trans women’s insistence that everyone uses said terms and phrases as “mansplaining.” 

both women make some excellent points, but their left-wing framework, bizarre racial fixation (in the case of luxgamma), and woke buzzwords ultimately set them up for failure. 

trans folks have shot back with the same woke terminology, saying that being a “cis woman” is a “privilege” and asserting that men cosplaying as women will always be more oppressed than real women. “even though you might not have it great because you’re a woman, you don’t have it twice as bad because you’re trans,” says james, a “they/she” tiktoker. 

https://www.tiktok.com/@jamesissmiling/video/7199791114696592683?_r=1&_t=8arsc47an9p

another transgender activist attacked leftists who oppose radical trans ideology by saying their “allyship to trans people is conditional” and smearing them as bigots with a “superiority complex.” 

after luxgamma began receiving hate from the radical trans movement, she felt compelled to go on a nearly 3-minute rant to prove her victimhood. but in the minds of the people she felt compelled to defend herself to, she was doomed to fail because transgender activists will always claim greater victim status. 

the biggest reason modern feminists cannot defend femininity from radical trans activists is that they themselves erased it decades ago. 

listen to tiktoker mikala tingler, who admitted that while she’s “all for being inclusive and making people feel seen and heard and welcomed,” she can’t get behind terms like “chestfeeding” or “birthing person.” “these are things that make womanhood so incredibly unique,” tingler said.

terms like chestfeeding and birthing person ignite visceral reactions from women of all persuasions, progressive or otherwise, because, as tingler said, it’s an erasure of something that makes women unique. it’s an intrinsic part of our being, and we all know it.

yet it was the second-wave feminist movement that first began popularizing the concept of “gender” as a social construct. it was the feminists who demonized women’s reproductive gifts, labeling them a curse and instead embracing hormone-disrupting birth control and abortion. indeed, the feminist movement killed millions of unborn children, while also rejecting femininity and dismissing the beauty of motherhood.

in a 2015 bbc interview, old-school feminist germaine greer stated that men who have undergone transgender surgery are not women. leftist students at cardiff university, where greer was scheduled to speak following the interview, created a petition to revoke her invitation on the grounds of “misogynistic views towards trans women.” 

the college students who “canceled” greer are her protégés. for decades, greer has been demonizing the nuclear family. she has claimed gender roles are a social construct and femininity is a form of subjugation that limits women’s autonomy and personal happiness. 

greer admonished the sexualization of women by men and countered it by sexualizing herself and encouraging other women to do so too. in 1969, greer co-founded a pornography magazine called suck: the first european sex paper. an interview with greer published in the magazine was titled “i am a whore,” and in a separate issue, the magazine published a naked photo of greer lying down with her legs over her shoulders and her face between her thighs. 

“there is nothing feminine about being pregnant,” she said in a 2018 interview. “it’s almost the antithesis of that. there’s nothing feminine about giving birth. it’s a bloody struggle, and you’ve got to be strong and brave. there’s nothing feminine about breastfeeding.”

if there’s nothing feminine about giving birth, why not use the term “birthing person”? when you peddle radical gender ideology for decades, don’t be surprised when it catches on. 

to greer’s credit, she’s had enough integrity to stand against transgenderism when she saw how damaging it has become for women. but she hasn’t renounced the radical feminist ideology — that she helped create — which made the transgender movement possible. 

transgenderism is greer’s legacy. she and her boomer second-wave feminist allies turned womanhood into a costume. the young progressives on tiktok fighting for womanhood are fighting a losing battle. just like greer taught them, they engage in hookup culture, avoid marriage, vilify men, and forgo motherhood for professional rat races. thanks to their foremothers, young progressives will never win back womanhood and femininity because they reject both.","['conservative', 'sound', 'alarm', 'bell', 'year', 'warn', 'denial', 'natural', 'sex', 'binary', 'devastating', 'cultural', 'ramification',

7875da9d-fd05-404d-9430-f63c748be850,anti,trump administration removes transgender references from federal government websites,"['trump', 'administration', 'remove', 'transgender', 'reference', 'federal', 'government', 'website']",new york post,victor nava,https://nypost.com/2025/01/31/us-news/trump-admin-removes-transgender-references-from-federal-government-websites/,1/31/2025,"federal government websites scrubbed pages with transgender references friday in an effort to comply with president trump’s day one executive order on sex and gender.  

the removal of the content comes after the us office of personnel management directed federal agencies earlier this week to “take down all outward facing media (websites, social media accounts, etc.) that inculcate or promote gender ideology” by 5 p.m. friday in order to comply with trump’s executive action. 

donald trump
trump’s jan. 20 executive order was aimed at “defending women” from “radical gender ideology.” shutterstock

the state department, for example, modified a webpage that earlier this week contained information for “lgbtqi+ travelers.” 

all references to “lgbtqi+” were changed to “lgb.”  

aside from shortening the acronym, the content on the page appears to be the same, including a warning noting that many countries “do not have it systems at ports of entry that can accept sex markers other than female and male.” 

the centers for disease control and prevention took down several pages related to transgender health as well. 

cdc webpages with information on “health disparities among lgbtq youth,” “supporting lgbtq+ youth,” “diabetes and the lgbtq community” and “facts about lgbt youth suicide” were all removed. 

a department of health and human services page housing “lgbtqi+ resources” was also taken down. however, a biden administration-era “know your rights guide” for “lgbtqi+ older adults” was still live as of friday evening.

several cdc webpages related to transgender health went dark friday. reuters

the website for the national institutes of health’s office for sexual & gender minority research office vanished too. 

several government webpages that appeared unrelated to gender ideology also went dark 

the cdc’s atlasplus tool, which allows users to access data related to hiv, viral hepatitis and other sexually transmitted diseases, went offline friday, along with the cdc’s social vulnerability index, which is used to assess “the degree of social vulnerability in communities at risk of environmental catastrophes.” 

a cdc page with information about hiv testing was also blank, as was the entire us census bureau’s website.  

the cdc and the census bureau did not respond to the post’s request for comment.

“opm sent guidance to agencies to remove gender ideology-related content from their websites by 5 pm today as part of the efforts to defend women and uphold the truth of biological sex against the radical claims of gender activists,” opm communications director mclaurine pinover said in a statement.

“this may have been misinterpreted to mean we would shut down government websites who weren’t able to comply but that is not the plan for continuing to implement this important effort,” she added, referring to a false report that all government websites would go dark friday.

trump’s jan. 20 executive order on gender ideology demanded that federal agencies remove “all statements, policies, regulations, forms, communications, or other internal and external messages that promote or otherwise inculcate gender ideology, and shall cease issuing such statements, policies, regulations, forms, communications or other messages.”

“agency forms that require an individual’s sex shall list male or female, and shall not request gender identity,” it continued. “agencies shall take all necessary steps, as permitted by law, to end the federal funding of gender ideology.” 

the 78-year-old president signed a similar order banning federal funding for diversity, equity and inclusion programs which has also resulted in references to dei being scrubbed from government websites. 

when asked about reports that government websites would go dark friday to comply with his executive orders trump responded: “that doesn’t sound like a bad idea to me.” 

“dei would have ruined our country. and now it’s dead. i think dei is dead, so if they want to scrub the website, that’s ok with me,” he added.","['federal', 'government', 'website', 'scrub', 'page', 'transgender', 'reference', 'friday', 'effort', 'comply', 'president', 'trump', 'day', 'executive', 'order', 'sex', 'gender', 'removal', 'content', 'come', 'office', 'personnel', 'management', 'direct', 'federal', 'agency', 'early', 'week', 'outward', 'face', 'medium', 'website', 'social', 'media', 'account', 'etc', 'inculcate', 'promote', 'gender', 'ideology', 'friday', 'order', 'comply', 'trump', 'executive', 'action', 'donald', 'trump', 'trump', 'jan', 'executive', 'order', 'aim', 'defend', 'woman', 'radical', 'gender', 'ideology', 'shutterstock', 'state', 'department', 'example', 'modify', 'webpage', 'early', 'week', 'contain', 'information', 'traveler', 'reference', 'change', 'lgb', 'aside', 'shorten', 'acronym', 'content', 'page', 'appear', 'include', 'warning', 'note', 'country', 'system', 'port', 'entry', 'accept', 'sex', 'marker', 'female', 'male', 'center', 'disease', 'control', 'prevention', 'take', 'page', 'relate', 'transgend', 'health', 'cdc', 'webpage', 'information', 'health', 'disparity', 'lgbtq', 'youth', 'support', 'youth', 'diabete', 'lgbtq', 'community', 'fact', 'lgbt', 'youth', 'suicide', 'remove', 'department', 'health', 'human', 'service', 'page', 'housing', 'resource', 'take', 'biden', 'administration', 'era', 'know', 'right', 'guide', 'old', 'adult', 'live', 'friday', 'evening', 'cdc', 'cdc', 'webpage', 'relate', 'transgender', 'health', 'go', 'dark', 'friday', 'reuter', 'website', 'national', 'institutes', 'health', 'office', 'sexual', 'gender', 'minority', 'research', 'office', 'vanish', 'government', 'webpage', 'appear', 'unrelated', 'gender', 'ideology', 'go', 'dark', 'cdc', 'atlasplus', 'tool', 'allow', 'user', 'access', 'datum', 'relate', 'hiv', 'viral', 'hepatitis', 'sexually', 'transmit', 'disease', 'go', 'offline', 'friday', 'cdc', 'social', 'vulnerability', 'index', 'assess', 'degree', 'social', 'vulnerability', 'community', 'risk', 'environmental', 'catastrophe', 'cdc', 'page', 'information', 'hiv', 'testing', 'blank', 'entire', 'census', 'bureau', 'website', 'cdc', 'census', 'bureau', 'respond', 'post', 'request', 'comment', 'opm', 'send', 'guidance', 'agency', 'remove', 'gender', 'ideology', 'relate', 'content', 'website', 'pm', 'today', 'effort', 'defend', 'woman', 'uphold', 'truth', 'biological', 'sex', 'radical', 'claim', 'gender', 'activist', 'opm', 'communication', 'director', 'mclaurine', 'pinover', 'say', 'statement', 'misinterpret', 'mean', 'shut', 'government', 'website', 'able', 'comply', 'plan', 'continue', 'implement', 'important', 'effort', 'add', 'refer', 'false', 'report', 'government', 'website', 'dark', 'friday', 'trump', 'jan', 'executive', 'order', 'gender', 'ideology', 'demand', 'federal', 'agency', 'remove', 'statement', 'policy', 'regulation', 'form', 'communication', 'internal', 'external', 'message', 'promote', 'inculcate', 'gender', 'ideology', 'shall', 'cease', 'issue', 'statement', 'policy', 'regulation', 'form', 'communication', 'message', 'cdc', 'website', 'webpage', 'pull', 'apparent', 'effort', 'comply', 'trump', 'executive', 'order', 'gender', 'ideology', 'cdc', 'agency', 'form', 'require', 'individual', 'sex', 'shall', 'list', 'male', 'female', 'shall', 'request', 'gender', 'identity', 'continue', 'agency', 'shall', 'necessary', 'step', 'permit', 'law', 'end', 'federal', 'funding', 'gender', 'ideology', 'year', 'old', 'president', 'sign', 'similar', 'order', 'ban', 'federal', 'funding', 'diversity', 'equity', 'inclusion', 'program', 'result', 'reference', 'dei', 'scrub', 'government', 'website', 'ask', 'report', 'government', 'website', 'dark', 'friday', 'comply', 'executive', 'order', 'trump', 'respond', 'sound', 'like', 'bad', 'idea', 'dei', 'ruin', 'country', 'dead', 'think', 'dei', 'dead', 'want', 'scrub', 'website', 'ok', 'add']",
dc19be02-deda-47cd-969e-fe9caf935e70,anti,‘look at me!’: drag queens hijack city council meeting demanding town become trans sanctuary,"['look', 'drag', 'queen', 'hijack', 'city', 'council', 'meeting', 'demand', 'town', 'trans', 'sanctuary']",the daily caller,nicole silverio,https://dailycaller.com/2025/02/12/drag-queens-city-council-meeting-worcester-massachusetts/,2/12/2025,"a crowd of far-left activists hijacked a council meeting in worcester, massachusetts, tuesday night to bully the members into making the city a “sanctuary” jurisdiction for transgender people.

the worcester city council caved to the activists by passing a resolution tuesday night to make the city a “sanctuary” area for men who think they are women and vice versa, citing president donald trump’s executive order requiring the federal government to only recognize two genders, according to the boston globe. during a hearing, several drag queens and activists in provocative makeup and outfits made threats to the city council and claimed to be fighting for their lives as they demanded that the local members pass the resolution.

one drag queen with blue hair and heavy makeup threatened that trans people would make worcester “a very unsafe place” if they did not get their way.

“i am multiply disabled … i am on the autism spectrum and i have narcolepsy so i couldn’t drive myself here, i had to hide from my driver that i was in drag, which is not an easy thing to do in drag … the reason that worcester needs to be a safe space for trans people is because i can’t go home where i can’t work, i can’t qualify for disability, i can’t drive because i am narcoleptic and my family doesn’t support me because i’m trans and then come to a city council that won’t listen to my voice,” the blue haired drag queen said. “i need the city to protect me because no one else will. and, i need the city to protect me because the federal government won’t, and if you think you’re afraid of trump, you should see how afraid of trump i am. if you say that you’re afraid of trump and that’s why you don’t want the city to be a safe space for trans people, you better prepare for trans people to make this a very unsafe space.” (related: ‘you’re welcome to tell me’: host lost for words after canada’s top conservative asks him how many genders there are)

other members, including one identifying herself as a professor at worcester state university, claimed trump is “trying to erase” them and ordered the members of the city council to ignore his executive order. more of them said if the council members opposed the resolution, then that would prove they did not mind if transgender people got killed.

one masked individual covered in tattoos compared trump to the ku klux klan and labeled him a fascist for requiring the federal government to recognize biological facts.

“right now in our country, trump is threatening the trans and gender diverse community,” one masked person covered in tattoos said. “he is using policy to take away protections, he is making it harder for trans people to renew passports and get the care they need. he is trying to erase us. these are no anxieties, these are indisputable facts. and he will not stop with trans people, he will not stop with immigrants, but he is limited, he’s a president, not a king. and he has the powers of the president as well as the limitations of one. so my question to the council is this, if he is going to use policy to hurt people, how can we use it to protect them? how can we stand up to him and say we won’t allow him to dictate what we do in our city?”

“we stood up against the kkk in 1924 and organizations like the ywca stand up against equality today,” the person said.

one individual appearing to be a woman arrived with a painted beard and glitter around her face and raged at the council members demanding she be listened to and taken seriously. one male wearing a skirt and ponytail screamed at the council members to take action before more of his friends allegedly die.

“can you look at me and tell me how many of my friends have to die before you do anything? look at me!” the person screamed. “f*cking pathetic!”

a bearded man in pigtails whined that council members care more about “easy funding” than the lives of transgender people and do not mind alleged “nazis.”","['crowd', 'far', 'leave', 'activist', 'hijack', 'council', 'meeting', 'worcester', 'massachusetts', 'tuesday', 'night', 'bully', 'member', 'make', 'city', 'sanctuary', 'jurisdiction', 'transgender', 'people', 'worcester', 'city', 'council', 'cave', 'activist', 'pass', 'resolution', 'tuesday', 'night', 'city', 'sanctuary', 'area', 'man', 'think', 'woman', 'vice', 'versa', 'cite', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'executive', 'order', 'require', 'federal', 'government', 'recognize', 'gender', 'accord', 'boston', 'globe', 'hearing', 'drag', 'queen', 'activist', 'provocative', 'makeup', 'outfit', 'threat', 'city', 'council', 'claim', 'fight', 'life', 'demand', 'local', 'member', 'pass', 'resolution', 'drag', 'queen', 'blue', 'hair', 'heavy', 'makeup', 'threaten', 'trans', 'people', 'worcester', 'unsafe', 'place', 'way', 'multiply', 'disabled', 'autism', 'spectrum', 'narcolepsy', 'drive', 'hide', 'driver', 'drag', 'easy', 'thing', 'drag', 'reason', 'worcester', 'need', 'safe', 'space', 'trans', 'people', 'home', 'work', 'qualify', 'disability', 'drive', 'narcoleptic', 'family', 'support', 'tran', 'come', 'city', 'council', 'will', 'listen', 'voice', 'blue', 'haired', 'drag', 'queen', 'say', 'need', 'city', 'protect', 'need', 'city', 'protect', 'federal', 'government', 'will', 'think', 'afraid', 'trump', 'afraid', 'trump', 'afraid', 'trump', 'want', 'city', 'safe', 'space', 'tran', 'people', 'well', 'prepare', 'tran', 'people', 'unsafe', 'space', 'relate', 'welcome', 'tell', 'host', 'lose', 'word', 'canada', 'conservative', 'ask', 'gender', 'member', 'include', 'identify', 'professor', 'worcester', 'state', 'university', 'claim', 'trump', 'try', 'erase', 'order', 'member', 'city', 'council', 'ignore', 'executive', 'order', 'say', 'council', 'member', 'oppose', 'resolution', 'prove', 'mind', 'transgender', 'people', 'get', 'kill', 'mask', 'individual', 'cover', 'tattoo', 'compare', 'trump', 'ku', 'klux', 'klan', 'label', 'fascist', 'require', 'federal', 'government', 'recognize', 'biological', 'fact', 'right', 'country', 'trump', 'threaten', 'tran', 'gender', 'diverse', 'community', 'mask', 'person', 'cover', 'tattoo', 'say', 'policy', 'away', 'protection', 'make', 'hard', 'tran', 'people', 'renew', 'passport', 'care', 'need', 'try', 'erase', 'anxiety', 'indisputable', 'fact', 'stop', 'trans', 'people', 'stop', 'immigrant', 'limited', 'president', 'king', 'power', 'president', 'limitation', 'question', 'council', 'go', 'use', 'policy', 'hurt', 'people', 'use', 'protect', 'stand', 'will', 'allow', 'dictate', 'city', 'stand', 'kkk', 'organization', 'like', 'ywca', 'stand', 'equality', 'today', 'person', 'say', 'individual', 'appear', 'woman', 'arrive', 'paint', 'beard', 'glitter', 'face', 'rage', 'council', 'member', 'demand', 'listen', 'take', 'seriously', 'male', 'wear', 'skirt', 'ponytail', 'scream', 'council', 'member', 'action', 'friend', 'allegedly', 'die', 'look', 'tell', 'friend', 'die', 'look', 'person', 'scream', 'pathetic', 'bearded', 'man', 'pigtail', 'whine', 'council', 'member', 'care', 'easy', 'funding', 'life', 'transgender', 'people', 'mind', 'allege', 'nazi']",

“there is no group out there that is more anti-gay than the trans movement,” rubin, who moved from california to florida in 2021, told “america’s newsroom” co-host dana perino. “so, there is nothing going on here that is stopping gay people or even trans people, by the way, from living fully actualized lives in florida. there are no laws about what adults can do with their lives or what they can do in the privacy of their own home.” (related: ‘wage a war on woke’: desantis touts culture war battles in key primary state ahead of anticipated presidential run)

“the only thing desantis has done related to this that seemingly has gotten the entire mainstream media in an uproar he doesn’t want drag performers putting on sexualized shows in front of children,” rubin, a gay conservative who formerly held liberal political views, continued, after defending republican gov. ron desantis of florida against attacks from the naacp. “we all know that is true, that has nothing to do with sexuality or anything else. there is a reason you have age of consent and things of that nature.”

the naacp issued a travel warning targeting florida saturday, citing desantis’ opposition to an advanced placement course that reportedly contained elements of critical race theory and so-called “queer theory.” critical race theory holds that america is fundamentally racist, teaches people to view every social interaction and person in terms of race and seeks to hold groups of people accountable for the actions of their ancestors.

desantis signed parental rights legislation in march 2022 over the opposition of disney, prompting a political feud. the florida governor also signed legislation that prohibited colleges from spending taxpayer funds on diversity, equity and inclusion (dei) programs and prohibited colleges from requiring applicants to submit diversity statements.

“there is absolutely nothing racist going on in florida,” rubin said, hitting back at the naacp.

the florida legislature also passed laws restricting abortion after the sixth week of pregnancy, expanding the march 2022 parental-rights law, enacting “constitutional carry,” initiating universal school choice, and targeting the use of environmental social governance (esg) in investment.

fires swept through southern california on wednesday, destroying hundreds of homes in los angeles county, and high winds only fueled the destruction. the democratic mayor of los angeles, karen bass, was slammed for slashing the los angeles fire department’s (lafd) budget by $17.6 million for fiscal year 2024 to 2025, fox 11 reported, citing la city controller kenneth mejia.

bass claimed in a press conference that none of the reductions made “would have impacted the situation that we were dealing with over the last couple of days.” she added that the city is “in tough budgetary times.” (related: ultimate troll job or genuine opinion: random guy’s question about la fires leaves local reporter flummoxed)

los angeles allocated $100,000 to the civil + human rights and equity department for a “midnight stroll transgender cafe,” according to its 2024 to 2025 budget. the funding’s purpose is to “support a safe haven for unsheltered transgender individuals in hollywood,” the document noted.

similarly, the cultural affairs department special appropriations budget allocated $100,000 for the national association for the advancement of colored people (naacp) awards.

the budget also appropriated $8,670 for the “one institute the international gay and lesbian archives.”

the one archives at the university of southern california (usc) libraries currently has an exhibit titled “sci-fi, magick, queer l.a.: sexual science and the imagi-nation,” which focuses on the occult and “the lgbtq movement.”

the budget also allocated $13,000 for “lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender heritage month programs” and $14,010 to the “gay men’s chorus of los angeles.”

los angeles’ african american history month, american indian heritage month, latino heritage month and asian american history month programs were each allocated $13,000. (related: la water and power officials rake in fat salaries as fire hydrants run dry)

the budget also appropriated $170,000 in total for “social justice art-worker investments.”

the lafd was blasted for promoting diversity, equity and inclusion (dei) initiatives, and its 2023 to 2026 strategic plan stated that dei was one of its “key goals.” a stated priority of the city’s first “lgbtq” and woman fire chief, kristin f. crowley, is “promoting a culture that values [dei].”

the retailer confirmed that it would not renew a five-year commitment for a racial equity center created after the death of george floyd in 2020, it would withdraw from a gay rights index from the lgbtq advocacy group the human rights campaign measuring workplace “inclusion” and it would begin tracking third-party retailers to the cease sale of transgender items for minors, according to the ap. walmart will also stop giving priority treatment to suppliers based on dei factors such as race or gender, the ap reported.

walmart said it will be monitoring its third-party marketplace items more closely to ensure they do not feature sexual and transgender products marketed toward minors, including chest binders intended for youth, according to the ap.

“our purpose, to help people save money and live better, has been at our core since our founding 62 years ago and continues to guide us today,” walmart said in a statement shared with the daily caller news foundation. “we can deliver on it because we are willing to change alongside our associates and customers who represent all of america. we’ve been on a journey and know we aren’t perfect, but every decision comes from a place of wanting to foster a sense of belonging, to open doors to opportunities for all our associates, customers and suppliers and to be a walmart for everyone.”

various corporations have been quietly backpedaling their dei practices amid intense public and legal pressure from consumers and shareholders. president-elect donald trump has criticized dei practices and promised to uproot “woke” ideology. dozens of investment advisors sent letters on nov. 15 warning several of america’s largest corporations that their diversity programs will become a liability when trump returns to the white house.

several companies have faced backlash from supporting dei and lgbtq initiatives, including target, which reported in august 2023 that it was lowering its sales and profit expectations for the rest of the year, after it faced criticism over the release of lgbtq products for children. target announced in may that it would only sell its lgbtq “pride” collection online and at select stores after boycotts cost the retailer nearly $13 billion in market value the summer prior, according to bloomberg. the retailer’s stock prices also dropped in 2016 amid boycotts after it introduced a policy allowing customers to choose the dressing room or restroom that aligned with their gender identity.

bud light’s pours reportedly declined in thousands of bars and restaurants across the u.s. after the brand partnered with transgender influencer dylan mulvaney in 2023. the company lost $1.4 billion in u.s. beer sales in 2023 due to boycotts over the marketing decision, according to forbes.

other major companies have also recently backtracked dei-related policies, including lowe’s, ford and stanley black & decker. major aviation manufacturer boeing also scrapped its entire dei division in october.

maine gov. janet mills issued an official statement that justified her state’s permitting of transgender (biological male) athletes in female sports wednesday following the u.s. department of justice (doj) filing a lawsuit against the pine tree state over the matter.

“i have fought tirelessly for the rights of women and girls, for the health and well-being of children and families,” reads a line from mills’ statement. (related: california seemingly still allows males to steal glory away from women and girls in female sports)

laurel libby, a republican state representative for maine, shared a statement blasting mills for her nonsense, and she featured mills’ sentence in it.

“let me be clear, governor janet mills’ claim that she has always stood up for the rights of women and girls in maine is completely false. the department of justice’s lawsuit against maine for refusing to comply with title ix is proof of that, as it would not exist if she had. her insistence that this issue has nothing to do with biological males in girls’ sports is not only baseless — it’s absurd,” said libby.

“this isn’t about states’ rights, as she claims; it’s about gov. mills and maine democrats pushing far-left ideologies that ignore biological reality. by disregarding title ix, they’ve discriminated against and endangered women and girls, and put maine students and families at a disadvantage. frankly, by promoting policies that erase the identities of women and girls in maine, it’s hard to believe even gov. mills believes what she’s saying.”

when liberal members of the media speak about males in female sports, the only thing they seem to really bring up is how the transgender athlete feels.

what about how the girls and women feel?

in the fight between common sense and fairness vs. nonsense and radical behavior, it’s absolutely crucial that females get highlighted. not only do they face all of the emotions from this tomfoolery, but they’re seemingly forgotten by everybody else who refuses to acknowledge them. it’s quite sad.

which takes me to a girl, taylor starling, who recently shared her story at the california state assembly. she explained how she lost her spot on the high school girls cross-country team so a male could be on the squad. (related: watch the daily caller’s “damaged” documentary)

a student-athlete attending martin luther king high school in riverside, california, starling said she was treated unfairly because of the school’s showing preferential treatment towards the transgender-identifying athlete. (related: female fencer stephanie turner lands huge honor after refusing to take on male competitor)

“i was removed from my varsity girls’ team and replaced by a newly-eligible male transfer student who received favorable treatment. i worked every day during summer with my team, and into the school year six days a week, waking up at 5 a.m. to attend morning practices and staying at school until 4:45 each day,” starling said.

“in late october, the male transfer student was given my spot after not being held to the same strict team requirements as me and the rest of the girls. he did not have to attend practice while my team and i were running seven miles a day together. after having my spot taken away from me that i earned, i missed out on running with my varsity team in one of the top cross-country invitationals of the season.”

starling said that both her and a teammate set up a peaceful protest which featured them sporting t-shirts reading, “save women’s sports.” the school ended up disciplining the two ladies for the protest.

“our athletic director made me remove my shirt and told me it was like wearing a swastika in front of a jewish person and said that i would face disciplinary action if i wore it again,” said starling.

“my title ix and free speech rights as a female matter too. why are girls being told that we must sit down and be quiet while boys unfairly get ahead of us in life? why do boys not have to attend practice and make the sacrifices that us girls make in order to be scholar athletes? just because those boys believe they are transgender? girls matter too. please protect us.”

the state legislature for radical left-wing california shut down not just one, but two bills tuesday that looked to ban transgender athletes from being able to compete in female sports. a few of the lawmakers branded the pieces of legislation as “cruel,” which is ironic considering women and girls getting glory stolen from them by biological males is cruel.

the legislation “would have required the california interscholastic federation, the governing body for high school sports, to adopt rules banning students whose sex was assigned male at birth from participating on a girls’ school sports team,” per the associated press. (related: female fencer bravely takes knee, forfeits against trans opponent in protest)

a second bill would’ve nixed a 2013 law that allows students to compete in school programs that are segregated by gender, including with athletic teams. the law also allows people to use facilities, like bathrooms, that line up with their sexual identification.

each bill would’ve been effective for students in k-12 and college.

republicans were in support of the legislation, saying that females would be given protection, while democrats turned it down because they view it as an attack on transgenders and lbbtq rights.

i don’t think anybody is shocked here considering this news is coming out of california. those people are absolutely crazy over there and have gone against science, common sense and decency for a while now.

the student who filmed the video, payton mcnabb, had previously sustained mental and physical injuries as a high school volleyball player when a transgender opponent spiked a ball in her face, according to fox news digital.

the video uploaded to twitter last week appears to show mcnabb approaching the transgender woman and asking, “why are you in the girls’ bathroom?” (related: injured volleyball player takes stand against transgender athletes on women’s teams after suffering concussion)

the unidentified individual responds, “i’m a trans girl.” mcnabb replies, “but you’re not a girl.”

“interesting, i’ve never had this before. i don’t know what to say, i’m sorry you feel that way,” the transgender woman says.

“i pay a lot of money to be safe in the bathroom,” mcnabb tells the individual, who responds, “me, too.”

mcnabb then can be heard asking the person, “do you think that’s ok?”

the transgender woman then appears to walk past mcnabb and out of the bathroom without responding to the question.

may mailman, mcnabb’s lawyer and the director of the independent women’s law center, said, “no matter what men are wearing or how they feel internally, schools can’t forget about their obligation to women.”

a spokesperson for wcu told fox news digital, “wcu is committed to upholding its principles and ensuring that all students have equal access to education and opportunities. violations of any university policies or state and federal laws will be addressed by appropriate campus officials.”

mcnabb, who suffered a concussion and neck injury after a transgender volleyball player spiked a ball into her face in 2022, posted on twitter, “currently, i’m facing reports to the school for alleged ‘transphobia,’ alongside attempts to tear down my sorority, despite it having nothing to do with it.”

although north carolina passed a bill in 2016 requiring citizens to use bathrooms corresponding to their biological sex, several portions of the bill were repealed a year later, fox news digital reported.

the legislation at the heart of this, hb25-1312, cleared the colorado house in early 2025 and is winding through the senate as of april. its supporters pitch it as a shield for transgender individuals, but peel back the rhetoric, and the real target emerges: parents who refuse to bow to an ideology that rushes kids into irreversible choices. the bill’s text is unambiguous—using a child’s birth name or biological pronouns (“deadnaming” or “misgendering”) can now be deemed “coercive control,” a legal synonym for abuse. refuse to endorse your child’s wish to transition? that stance could tip the scales against you in a custody fight. stand firm in your beliefs, and you might lose your kid entirely.

the implications are chilling. “gender-affirming care” sounds warm and fuzzy—until you unpack it. puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones, even surgeries—are dangled before children too young to vote, drive, or fathom the lifelong fallout. decades of research, including studies showing 80% or more of kids with gender dysphoria reconcile with their biological sex after puberty, suggest caution, not haste. yet colorado’s bill brooks no such nuance. it demands affirmation over investigation, punishing parents who opt for patience instead of pills. to me, flooding a child’s body with experimental drugs or carving it up isn’t care—it’s harm, pure and simple. (related: trump’s ed dept launches ‘special investigations team’ to root out gender ideology, trans athletes)

this law doesn’t protect kids; it strong-arms parents into compliance. picture a 12-year-old, swayed by tiktok trends or peer pressure, declaring they’re transgender. one parent urges, “let’s slow down, talk it out, see a counselor.” the other races to a clinic for hormones. under hb25-1312, the cautious parent could be tagged as abusive, their voice silenced in court. that’s not safeguarding children—it’s coercion masquerading as enlightenment.

parental rights aren’t about dominance—they’re about duty. we know our kids intimately: their fears, their joys, their blind spots. we’re their first line of defense, not some judge or activist armed with a checklist. this bill obliterates that bond, imposing a rigid, ideologically driven script that trumps evidence and erases individual context. it’s a slippery slope—today, it’s gender identity; tomorrow, what else will the state dictate about our children?

advocates of “gender-affirming care” tout it as a cure-all, but it’s a high-stakes roll of the dice with kids’ bodies and futures. puberty blockers aren’t candy—they can stunt bone growth and fertility. hormones and surgeries leave permanent marks. why should parents be forced to play along—or risk losing custody for daring to dissent? colorado’s law isn’t about safety; it’s about control, plain and simple.

this isn’t progress—it’s a betrayal of the people most entrusted to protect our children. parents aren’t the enemy here; they’re the ones fighting to keep their kids whole. colorado needs to hear it loud and clear: stop this overreach. our rights—and our children’s well-being—depend on it.","['parent', 'force', 'enable', 'harm', 'child', 'primal', 'instinct', 'shield', 'nurture', 'guide', 'kid', 'life', 'storm', 'colorado', 'charge', 'law', 'turn', 'instinct', 'upside', 'brand', 'abusive', 'parent', 'question', 'child', 'desire', 'change', 'gender', 'minor', 'policy', 'tweak', 'frontal', 'assault', 'parental', 'right', 'prop', 'flimsy', 'facade', 'gender', 'affirm', 'practice', 'abuse', 'cloak', 'compassion', 'legislation', 'heart', 'clear', 'colorado', 'house', 'early', 'wind', 'senate', 'april', 'supporter', 'pitch', 'shield', 'transgender', 'individual', 'peel', 'rhetoric', 'real', 'target', 'emerge', 'parent', 'refuse', 'bow', 'ideology', 'rush', 'kid', 'irreversible', 'choice', 'bill', 'text', 'unambiguous', 'child', 'birth', 'biological', 'pronoun', 'deadname', 'misgendere', 'deem', 'coercive', 'control', 'legal', 'synonym', 'abuse', 'refuse', 'endorse', 'child', 'wish', 'transition', 'stance', 'tip', 'scale', 'custody', 'fight', 'stand', 'firm', 'belief', 'lose', 'kid', 'entirely', 'implication', 'chilling', 'gender', 'affirm', 'care', 'sound', 'warm', 'fuzzy', 'unpack', 'puberty', 'blocker', 'cross', 'sex', 'hormone', 'surgery', 'dangle', 'child', 'young', 'vote', 'drive', 'fathom', 'lifelong', 'fallout', 'decade', 'research', 'include', 'study', 'show', 'kid', 'gender', 'dysphoria', 'reconcile', 'biological', 'sex', 'puberty', 'suggest', 'caution', 'haste', 'colorado', 'bill', 'brooks', 'nuance', 'demand', 'affirmation', 'investigation', 'punish', 'parent', 'opt', 'patience', 'instead', 'pill', 'flood', 'child', 'body', 'experimental', 'drug', 'carve', 'care', 'harm', 'pure', 'simple', 'related', 'trump', 'ed', 'dept', 'launch', 'special', 'investigation', 'team', 'root', 'gender', 'ideology', 'trans', 'athlete', 'law', 'protect', 'kid', 'strong', 'arm', 'parent', 'compliance', 'picture', 'year', 'old', 'sway', 'tiktok', 'trend', 'peer', 'pressure', 'declare', 'transgender', 'parent', 'urge', 'let', 'slow', 'talk', 'counselor', 'race', 'clinic', 'hormone', 'cautious', 'parent', 'tag', 'abusive', 'voice', 'silence', 'court', 'safeguard', 'child', 'coercion', 'masquerade', 'enlightenment', 'parental', 'right', 'dominance', 'duty', 'know', 'kid', 'intimately', 'fear', 'joy', 'blind', 'spot', 'line', 'defense', 'judge', 'activist', 'arm', 'checklist', 'bill', 'obliterate', 'bond', 'impose', 'rigid', 'ideologically', 'drive', 'script', 'trump', 'evidence', 'erase', 'individual', 'context', 'slippery', 'slope', 'today', 'gender', 'identity', 'tomorrow', 'state', 'dictate', 'child', 'advocate', 'gender', 'affirm', 'care', 'tout', 'cure', 'high', 'stake', 'roll', 'dice', 'kid', 'body', 'future', 'puberty', 'blocker', 'candy', 'stunt', 'bone', 'growth', 'fertility', 'hormone', 'surgery', 'leave', 'permanent', 'mark', 'parent', 'force', 'play', 'risk', 'lose', 'custody', 'dare', 'dissent', 'colorado', 'law', 'safety', 'control', 'plain', 'simple', 'progress', 'betrayal', 'people', 'entrust', 'protect', 'child', 'parent', 'enemy', 'one', 'fight', 'kid', 'colorado', 'need', 'hear', 'loud', 'clear', 'stop', 'overreach', 'right', 'child', 'depend']",

stephanie turner, a female fencer, made an appearance on outkick‘s “gaines for girls” podcast for an interview with riley gaines. the two talked about her move to bravely take a knee and forfeit a match against a transgender athlete at a usa fencing event in protest.

the conversation was centered around the backlash she and other females have received for protesting against biological males in women’s and girls sports. (related: doge to hold hearing on usa fencing transgender nonsense after woman gets punished for protesting unfairness)

handed out by xx-xy athletics, turner landed the courage wins award for being brave in her refusal to participate against a trans athlete. turner said she is appreciative of the award because she feels like her life is getting “nuked” due to her justified protest.

“there are quite a lot of women who are witnessing men in their sports, and they’re trying to save their own sports on their own, and it’s hard to come out because you essentially nuke your whole life,” said turner to gaines. “you can face social ostracism, you can have financial blowback, you can have training disrupted, and you could have officials or referees now not being very favorable toward you for the rest of your life. there is no end to the backlash that you may have.”

“it’s not fun being on the receiving end of this, it’s not what i wanted to do and it helps to have people who acknowledge that, but it takes some sort of sacrifice to bring attention to an issue and i appreciate xx-xy for their acknowledgement.”

a fencing academy of philadelphia member, stephanie turner decided to take a knee and forfeit against a transgender (biological male) opponent in protest.

turner was set to square off sunday against trans fencer redmond sullivan during the usa fencing event, the cherry blossom – d1a/vet roc, that took place in maryland.

a left-wing entity by far, usa fencing has been quite open about how they’ve wanted biological males to participate against biological females. (related: female college rower who identifies as male still chooses to participate in women’s sports)

each turner and sullivan were involved in the division ia women’s foil, however, turner made the move to not participate against sullivan and forfeited the match to protest the unfair nonsense that is happening in female sports.

in footage that’s been going viral, tallying more than one million views in only hours, turner took a knee. sullivan walked over to turner, and following a quick chat, sullivan went away.

due to turner forfeiting, she was given a “dnf” (did not finish) in the tournament results. sullivan moved on with her victory being labeled a forfeit win.

it’s sad that stephanie turner had to do this to begin with, ruining her chances of winning a tournament, but you have to applaud her efforts for the cause.

fe1b81ff-35fe-450e-b306-846611aab382,anti,exclusive: university of kentucky offers to violate state law to trans kids — changes tune when reporter notices,"['exclusive', 'university', 'kentucky', 'offer', 'violate', 'state', 'law', 'trans', 'kid', 'change', 'tune', 'reporter', 'notice']",the daily caller,amber duke,https://dailycaller.com/2025/04/11/university-kentucky-transgender-gender-affirming-care-minors-children-state-ban/,4/11/2025,"the university of kentucky’s hospital system hypothetically offered to provide transgender services to a child, which would constitute a violation of state law, according to an investigation by the daily caller.

a staff member for the uk healthcare department of family and community medicine at circle told the caller on march 31 that they would schedule an appointment for hormone therapy for a hypothetical 15-year-old child.

“um, yes, we do have trans … health at circle,” the staff member said during a phone conversation.

“i also wanted to say that he’s also 15, i wasn’t sure if that changes anything,” a caller reporter stated.

the staff member replied, “it does not.”

when asked specifically what services circle provides, the staff member explained, “hormone therapy — we don’t do the surgeries but we do have a facility that does surgery.”

republicans in the kentucky legislature passed a law in 2023 that would ban sex change surgeries, hormone therapy, and puberty blockers for patients under 18. democratic kentucky gov. andy beshear vetoed the legislation, but the legislature overrode his veto in march 2023. beshear claimed the ban would “endanger the children of kentucky.”

the university of kentucky said in a statement to the caller the next day, april 1, that they follow state law, as well as president donald trump’s executive order pulling federal funding from healthcare facilities that provide gender transition services to minors.

“the university complies with state law and president trump’s executive order on gender affirming care,” kristi willett, the executive director of public relations for the university of kentucky, told the caller.

trump signed an executive order jan. 28 prohibiting federal funding from going to hospitals and healthcare facilities that offered sex changes to minors. the order was paused in late february after two federal judges issued preliminary injunctions in response to legal challenges against the president’s action. a daily caller investigation found that more than three dozen hospitals were still offering the services to minors. (related: exclusive: children’s hospitals continue offering sex changes after trump moved to defund procedures) 

former kentucky attorney general daniel cameron said in a statement that hospitals who “chemically and surgically mutilate” children “should be held accountable.”

“protecting kentucky kids is not up for debate. president trump and kentucky lawmakers took decisive actions to end this permanent, life-altering harm. any medical professional who chemically and surgically mutilates vulnerable children in secret or under the guise of some rebranded effort should be held accountable,” cameron told the caller.

the caller called uk healthcare’s circle clinic again on april 2, the day after receiving a statement from the university denying that they were violating state law. this time, the caller was given a different story as to whether or not they are still providing “gender affirming care.”

“i just spoke with my manager and she said there is a new law where apparently they have to be over 18 for hormone therapy,” a staff member said. “they could still be scheduled in the clinic but they would not be able to do the hormone therapy.”

republican kentucky attorney general russell coleman did not respond to a request for comment.","['university', 'kentucky', 'hospital', 'system', 'hypothetically', 'offer', 'provide', 'transgender', 'service', 'child', 'constitute', 'violation', 'state', 'law', 'accord', 'investigation', 'daily', 'caller', 'staff', 'member', 'uk', 'healthcare', 'department', 'family', 'community', 'medicine', 'circle', 'tell', 'caller', 'march', 'schedule', 'appointment', 'hormone', 'therapy', 'hypothetical', 'year', 'old', 'child', 'um', 'yes', 'trans', 'health', 'circle', 'staff', 'member', 'say', 'phone', 'conversation', 'want', 'sure', 'change', 'caller', 'reporter', 'state', 'staff', 'member', 'reply', 'ask', 'specifically', 'service', 'circle', 'provide', 'staff', 'member', 'explain', 'hormone', 'therapy', 'surgery', 'facility', 'surgery', 'republicans', 'kentucky', 'legislature', 'pass', 'law', 'ban', 'sex', 'change', 'surgery', 'hormone', 'therapy', 'puberty', 'blocker', 'patient', 'democratic', 'kentucky', 'gov', 'andy', 'beshear', 'veto', 'legislation', 'legislature', 'override', 'veto', 'march', 'beshear', 'claim', 'ban', 'endanger', 'child', 'kentucky', 'university', 'kentucky', 'say', 'statement', 'caller', 'day', 'april', 'follow', 'state', 'law', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'executive', 'order', 'pull', 'federal', 'funding', 'healthcare', 'facility', 'provide', 'gender', 'transition', 'service', 'minor', 'university', 'complie', 'state', 'law', 'president', 'trump', 'executive', 'order', 'gender', 'affirming', 'care', 'kristi', 'willett', 'executive', 'director', 'public', 'relation', 'university', 'kentucky', 'tell', 'caller', 'trump', 'sign', 'executive', 'order', 'jan', 'prohibit', 'federal', 'funding', 'go', 'hospital', 'healthcare', 'facility', 'offer', 'sex', 'change', 'minor', 'order', 'pause', 'late', 'february', 'federal', 'judge', 'issue', 'preliminary', 'injunction', 'response', 'legal', 'challenge', 'president', 'action', 'daily', 'caller', 'investigation', 'find', 'dozen', 'hospital', 'offer', 'service', 'minor', 'related', 'exclusive', 'child', 'hospital', 'continue', 'offer', 'sex', 'change', 'trump', 'move', 'defund', 'procedure', 'kentucky', 'attorney', 'general', 'daniel', 'cameron', 'say', 'statement', 'hospital', 'chemically', 'surgically', 'mutilate', 'child', 'hold', 'accountable', 'protect', 'kentucky', 'kid', 'debate', 'president', 'trump', 'kentucky', 'lawmaker', 'take', 'decisive', 'action', 'end', 'permanent', 'life', 'alter', 'harm', 'medical', 'professional', 'chemically', 'surgically', 'mutilate', 'vulnerable', 'child', 'secret', 'guise', 'rebrande', 'effort', 'hold', 'accountable', 'cameron', 'tell', 'caller', 'caller', 'call', 'uk', 'healthcare', 'circle', 'clinic', 'april', 'day', 'receive', 'statement', 'university', 'deny', 'violate', 'state', 'law', 'time', 'caller', 'give', 'different', 'story', 'provide', 'gender', 'affirming', 'care', 'speak', 'manager', 'say', 'new', 'law', 'apparently', 'hormone', 'therapy', 'staff', 'member', 'say', 'schedule', 'clinic', 'able', 'hormone', 'therapy', 'republican', 'kentucky', 'attorney', 'general', 'russell', 'coleman', 'respond', 'request', 'comment']",

actresses like megan fox, jennifer lopez and charlize theron have been posing for photos next to their transgender or “non-binary” kids, sending a message that this is somehow the new definition of cool. fox specifically has styled her three boys in very obviously feminine ways, something that northwestern university psychologist dr. michael bailey called “kind of crazy.”

“i think that our society now is kind of crazy, and that is, you know, that’s an example, i guess, of how we’re crazy, and i think that’s really bad for our society. i don’t know why anybody would think that’s a good idea,” bailey told the daily caller.

fox has openly discussed her support of her alleged non-binary child noah, a son she shares with ex-husband brian austin green. noah has been photographed wearing dresses when he was as young as age five. the “transformers” actress insisted that he made that fashion choice himself but has also admitted to encouraging noah to form a unique identity. fox says noah started wearing dresses at age two, according to people.

“when i became pregnant with noah, i could feel, through my mother’s intuition i suppose, that he was not subscribing to gender stereotypes, so i decided to provide an environment for him early on that would allow him to discover how he wanted to express himself,” she said in a 2019 interview with education and career news.

noah apparently gets bullied at school, but fox told glamour in a 2022 interview she gave her son books that tell him it’s okay to dress like a girl.

the number of american adults and children who identify as transgender is about 0.5 and 1.4 percent, respectively, according to a williams institute study. the odds of having a transgender child is one in 3000, according to renowned clinical psychologist and youtube personality, dr. jordan peterson.

dr. bailey told the caller that actors aren’t really known for being “mentally healthy people,” which perhaps can explain certain choices.

“they’re known for being good actors and actresses, and, you know, they tend to be good looking and so on. i think that there’s probably a high rate of certain kinds of problems, like personality disorders. i’m not saying [fox] has one, although this behavior certainly makes me wonder.”

music video director and former republican congressional candidate robbie starbuck said in a 2023 tweet that he used to live in the same gated community as fox. starbuck claimed he saw two of fox’s sons having a breakdown over their mom allegedly forcing them to wear girls clothing.

fox responded angrily, writing on instagram in part, “irregardless of how desperate you may become at any given time to acquire wealth, power, success, or fame – never use children as leverage or social currency. [e]specially under malevolent and erroneous pretense.”

“you f—ked with the wrong witch,” she concluded.

in hollywood, society and local communities, the case of transgender affirmations seem to be far more prevalent now than ever before. and there can be grave consequences to this, bailey says.

“one thing that’s becoming clear is that when you socially transition the child, that’s the term for letting the child live as the other sex, they are much more likely to go on and want medical transition later,” he told the caller, warning that permanent sex changes have “serious side effects.”

dr. bailey suggested celebrities might be showcasing their gender-bending children to gain attention, which is something that’s in their nature.

“the wacky ones are gonna be proud of transitioning their kids, and they’re gonna want people to know about it. another thing about celebrities is they’re kind of exhibitionist … they’re morally exhibitionist. they’re right. they want you to know about it.”

american author, activist and de-transitioner walt hayer knows first-hand how damaging this type of child-rearing can be and has written various books about the dangers of transitioning.

his grandmother clothed him in dresses when he was younger, much like fox does with her son. eventually, after what he calls a misdiagnosis of gender dysphoria, hayer underwent medical and surgical procedures and lived as a transgender woman for eight years — something that affected him deeply.

“so the issue that i have with it is that this happened to me personally, and it destroyed my life,” hayer told the caller. “i didn’t recover from this until i was 50-years-old, and i had to go — i had to go through, you know, psychotherapy. i went through the surgical transition. i went through all of this crap.”

ben affleck has a 15-year-old child with jennifer garner named seraphina rose. during rose’s grandfather’s funeral in april, she stood on the podium and introduced herself as “fin,” suggesting she too has decided to take a more androgynous route.

lopez, affleck’s current wife, introduced her then-14-year-old daughter emme with “gender-neutral” pronouns (they/them) in 2022 before they performed a duet at dodgers stadium.

“they are very, very busy, booked and pricey,” lopez said, according to the independent. “they cost me when they come out. but they’re worth every single penny because they’re my favorite duet partner of all time. so if you will indulge me.”

parents who encourage their children to identify like this are misleading them, according to hayer.

“all we’re doing is devaluing, dehumanizing and destroying an entire generation of children when we engage in this practice of telling them that they’re transgender. this is the one thing that really burns at me,” he said. “there are no transgenders. they don’t exist.”

this phenomena is a social contagion, and celebrities taking these stances are doing so to become part of a group, hayer believes.

“gee, i have a trans kid. i have a trans kid. we get to talk about our trans kid. it’s sort of like, you know, parading your schnauzer down to the coffee shop and saying that i’ve got this special dog that you don’t have,” he told the caller. “and i just really believe it’s sickening what they’re doing, man. i’m appalled in the stuff that i suffered because of what my grandma did to me.”

“i just think that the adults who are doing this to their kids really feel like somehow they joined a group of highly intellectual people that are smarter than you.”

famous actress charlize theron has adopted two children, jackson in 2012 and august in 2015.

theron claimed during a 2019 interview with daily mail that jackson, now 11, was transgender.

“yes, i thought [jackson] was a boy, too,” she recalled. “until she looked at me when she was three years old and said: ‘i am not a boy!'”

hayer issued a strong warning about the damage this could potentially cause.

“they don’t realize that 30 to four years later, the kid’s going to commit suicide, or he’s going to be an alcoholic, which i was — i attempted suicide twice. if that’s what you want for your child, then, by all means, go for it,” hayer said. “they will never be able to be boys. won’t be able to produce sperm, so they won’t be able to be a father,” hayer said.

theron has defended drag shows for kids and thinks that homophobia, racism and sexism are the reasons hiv spread.

“we love you, queens. we’re in your corner and we’ve got you,” theron said in a may 2023 video, referring to drag queens. “i will fuck anybody up who’s trying to fuck with anything with you guys. there are so many things that are hurting and, really, killing our kids, and we all know what i’m talking about right now, and it ain’t no drag queen.”

more than twice as many men who said they were transgender and underwent a sex change procedure attempted suicide, as opposed to those who didn’t undergo the procedure, according to a study done by the american urological association (aua).

forty-two percent of transgender-identifying adults have attempted suicide, 81 percent have thought about it and 56 percent have self-injured themselves non-suicidally, according to a williams institute study.

hollywood is now, more than ever, full of stars who are affirming their children’s sex changes very publicly. today’s youth are growing up in the digital age, which makes them susceptible to celebrities’ influence.

angelina jolie and brad pitt have a daughter named shiloh, who is now 18. shiloh had been toying with gender since the age of three, jolie said in a 2010 interview with vanity fair.

“she wants to be a boy,” jolie remarked at the time. “so we had to cut her hair. she likes to wear boy clothes. she thinks she’s one of her brothers.”

while shiloh doesn’t appear to be full-on transgender, she has presented in a very masculine form throughout the years, including in pictures with her mom.

nowadays, she seem to be taking a more androgynous approach.

dr. jill simons, executive director of the american college of pediatricians, explained to the caller what she thinks might be fueling the transgender craze.

“historically, you know, decades ago, when you looked at those children who grew up to be adults that did have what was diagnosed as gender dysphoria, it was a very small percentage, less than one percent,” she said, noting this was primarily associated with boys at the time. “that is how it had been for a long, long time, until most recently. and now we’re seeing almost a reverse of this, presenting in adolescents with teenage girls. and you know, we’re seeing in some communities, you know, 1,000% increase in the number of cases of children presenting with gender discord. either something in biology changed in the last couple decades, or, this is not biologically based. this is some social contagion, or some, you know, outside influence that’s causing this,” dr. simons told the daily caller.

therapists and mental health professionals could be put in danger of losing their license if they don’t affirm a child’s identity, because not doing so could be labeled “discrimination,” according to dr. simons.

michigan, for instance, passed a law in july 2023 that banned so-called “conversion therapy,” which house bill 4617 defines as “any practice or treatment by a mental health professional that seeks to change an individual’s sexual orientation or gender identity, including, but not limited to, efforts to change behavior or gender expression.”

twenty-three states plus washington, d.c., have banned what they deem “conversion therapy.”

“therapists, mental health professionals, when they’re counseling someone who is expressing concerns about, you know, their biological sex, they have been regulated and told that if they start to look for a different cause, other than, you know, this is who they are, they question that this person is not trans,” dr. simons told the caller, “when they say they’re not trans, then that’s discriminating, and they’re in threat of losing their license.”

sometimes a natural transition through puberty could cause doubts and fear in children, and instead of explaining and working through these matters, medical professionals are quickly labeling the children as transgender, dr. simons explained.

“instead of us as adults and professionals, saying, you know, yeah, puberty is a little rough … you’re awkward, and your body is doing things, you know, growing and out of sync. and instead of saying, ‘yes, that’s normal to not feel great sometimes in your body,’ we’re telling them, ‘oh my gosh, there must be something wrong with you’ — that is horrible and that is cruel,” she said.

“and so it has become a catch-all diagnosis.”

dr. simons said parents are oftentimes victimized in this process as well.

“i feel like they’re being misled, and even a stronger word, you know, being tricked by doctors saying you need to do this for your child.”

professionals are telling children, “this is the best evidence. this is the best medical care, and parents are used to trusting doctors, you know, saying, ‘okay, we come to you because we want to know what the best thing is.’ and they want the best for their children. i believe most parents do, and so they will do anything to help their child.” (related: ben affleck’s daughter seraphina rose appears to reveal new name at grandad’s funeral: report)

“it’s very hard as a parent to say, ‘i don’t agree with you,’ let alone they may not have the right information to say — to question it. and so, you know, part of what we’re doing is trying to educate not only pediatricians but parents. and i think parents are becoming more educated about, you know, really, what some of these trans affirming care treatments involve, and that they are potentially harmful. i think parents are feeling more emboldened to stand up.”

simons told the caller, however, “parents may have other agendas.”","['celebrity', 'trend', 'season', 'hot', 'fashion', 'designer', 'jewelry', 'item', 'flashy', 'car', 'instead', 'hollywood', 'star',

nikki hiltz, a runner who claims to be a “non-binary transgender” and was a competitor in the 2024 paris olympics, has issued an applause to the boston marathon for making the move to allow male athletes to compete against women.

as we all know, the boston marathon is one of the most legendary races in the united states. monday, they will actually be allowing transgender athletes to take part in the women’s division. and to make that even crazier, this is happening even though they already have another category for “non-binary” people. (related: teenage girl cries while saying she was ‘traumatized’ by trans athlete, school board prez demands her to ‘wrap it up’)

well, when a woman competitor spoke out about her concerns on social media regarding the issue, hiltz tossed insults at her and threw 100% of her support behind biological male athletes.

“are you gonna win the woman’s division or take prize money? i don’t think so,” said hiltz in a clip published on instagram. “so i don’t understand what you’re upset about? like, are you mad because instead of 900 you’re gonna take 901st, because a trans woman maybe beats you?”

“this person forgot what the point of a marathon is. it’s to complete 26.2 miles and maybe make some friends along the way. trans women are not stopping you from doing that.”

it’s crazy to me that there are women out there who actually think like this … the west has a serious, serious problem.","['absolute', 'disgrace', 'nikki', 'hiltz', 'runner', 'claim', 'non', 'binary', 'transgender', 'competitor', 'paris', 'olympic', 'issue', 'applause', 'boston', 'marathon', 'make', 'allow', 'male', 'athlete', 'compete', 'woman', 'know', 'boston', 'marathon', 'legendary', 'race', 'united', 'states', 'monday', 'actually', 'allow', 'transgender', 'athlete', 'woman', 'division', 'crazy', 'happen', 'category', 'non', 'binary', 'people', 'related', 'teenage', 'girl', 'cry', 'say', 'traumatized', 'trans', 'athlete', 'school', 'board', 'prez', 'demand', 'wrap', 'woman', 'competitor', 'speak', 'concern', 'social', 'medium', 'issue', 'hiltz', 'toss', 'insult', 'throw', 'support', 'biological', 'male', 'athlete', 'go', 'to', 'win', 'woman', 'division', 'prize', 'money', 'think', 'say', 'hiltz', 'clip', 'publish', 'instagram', 'understand', 'upset', 'like', 'mad', 'instead', 'go', 'to', 'trans', 'woman', 'maybe', 'beat', 'person', 'forget', 'point', 'marathon', 'complete', 'mile', 'maybe', 'friend', 'way', 'tran', 'woman', 'stop', 'crazy', 'woman', 'actually', 'think', 'like', 'west', 'problem']",
805c0231-a6b9-4c52-a5b8-9cd59b391ead,anti,college volleyball player claims school deceived her into living with transgender roommate,"['college', 'volleyball', 'player', 'claim', 'school', 'deceive', 'live', 'transgender', 'roommate']",the daily caller,mariane angela,https://dailycaller.com/2024/10/04/sjsu-tricked-trans-roommate-brooke-slusser/,10/4/2024,"a college volleyball player revealed friday on fox news that san jose state university (sjsu) misled her into sharing an apartment with a man who identifies as transgender.

sjsu volleyball team co-captain brooke slusser said that the school facilitated her living with a transgender teammate without disclosing to her her roommate’s biological sex during an appearance on “the ingraham angle.” slusser transferred to the university in her junior year and was advised to move into a housing situation with what she believed were all-female teammates.

“i transferred here my junior year and was recommended to move into an apartment with a group of girls, i assumed,” slusser told laura ingraham. “and so i moved in and later on came to find out that one of them was a man with no knowledge and would not have made that decision if i had known beforehand that i would be living with a man.”

during the same interview, international women’s forum attorney may mailman voiced concerns about recent policies from the biden administration affecting female athletes.

“but where is kamala harris? the biden-harris administration issued a title ix regulation that will send the full weight of the federal government to take your funding away if you misgender somebody, quote, unquote, misgender someone,” mailman said. “and here we have women being injured. we have women receiving death threats. we have women having to shower with men. and does kamala harris have anything to say about it? no, she doesn’t. so this is a federal government issue.”

the biden administration expanded title ix protections in april, detailing new federal safeguards for lgbt students and sexual assault survivors and broadening the scope of what constitutes sexual harassment in educational settings. this rule has been blocked by courts in a number of states, including louisiana, mississippi, montana and idaho.

the controversy extends beyond the federal government to other significant figures in sports administration, as mailman said that charlie baker, president of the ncaa, has been similarly called out for his silence. (related: manhattan school board district proposes resolution that could ban trans competitors in female sports)

“this is also a charlie baker issue. he is the president of the ncaa. he has received more than 7,000 individualized letters that the independent women’s forum has facilitated, silence, nothing,” mailman continued.

the revelation comes after utah state university became the fourth institution to forfeit its upcoming women’s volleyball game against sjsu on oct. 23 amid ongoing disputes over a player’s gender identity, nbc news reported. this decision follows similar actions by the university of wyoming, boise state university and southern utah university, all of which have dropped matches against the california team in the past three weeks.","['college', 'volleyball', 'player', 'reveal', 'friday', 'fox', 'news', 'san', 'jose', 'state', 'university', 'sjsu', 'mislead', 'share', 'apartment', 'man', 'identify', 'transgender', 'sjsu', 'volleyball', 'team', 'co', 'captain', 'brooke', 'slusser', 'say', 'school', 'facilitate', 'live', 'transgender', 'teammate', 'disclose', 'roommate', 'biological', 'sex', 'appearance', 'ingraham', 'angle', 'slusser', 'transfer', 'university', 'junior', 'year', 'advise', 'housing', 'situation', 'believe', 'female', 'teammate', 'transfer', 'junior', 'year', 'recommend', 'apartment', 'group', 'girl', 'assume', 'slusser', 'tell', 'laura', 'ingraham', 'move', 'later', 'come', 'find', 'man', 'knowledge', 'decision', 'know', 'live', 'man', 'interview', 'international', 'woman', 'forum', 'attorney', 'mailman', 'voice', 'concern', 'recent', 'policy', 'biden', 'administration', 'affect', 'female', 'athlete', 'kamala', 'harris', 'biden', 'harris', 'administration', 'issue', 'title', 'ix', 'regulation', 'send', 'weight', 'federal', 'government', 'funding', 'away', 'misgender', 'somebody', 'quote', 'unquote', 'misgender', 'mailman', 'say', 'woman', 'injure', 'woman', 'receive', 'death', 'threat', 'woman', 'have', 'shower', 'man', 'kamala', 'harris', 'federal', 'government', 'issue', 'biden', 'administration', 'expand', 'title', 'ix', 'protection', 'april', 'detail', 'new', 'federal', 'safeguard', 'lgbt', 'student', 'sexual', 'assault', 'survivor', 'broaden', 'scope', 'constitute', 'sexual', 'harassment', 'educational', 'setting', 'rule', 'block', 'court', 'number', 'state', 'include', 'louisiana', 'mississippi', 'montana', 'idaho', 'controversy', 'extend', 'federal', 'government', 'significant', 'figure', 'sport', 'administration', 'mailman', 'say', 'charlie', 'baker', 'president', 'ncaa', 'similarly', 'call', 'silence', 'related', 'manhattan', 'school', 'board', 'district', 'propose', 'resolution', 'ban', 'trans', 'competitor', 'female', 'sport', 'charlie', 'baker', 'issue', 'president', 'ncaa', 'receive', 'individualized', 'letter', 'independent', 'woman', 'forum', 'facilitate', 'silence', 'mailman', 'continue', 'revelation', 'come', 'utah', 'state', 'university', 'fourth', 'institution', 'forfeit', 'upcoming', 'woman', 'volleyball', 'game', 'sjsu', 'oct', 'amid', 'ongoing', 'dispute', 'player', 'gender', 'identity', 'nbc', 'news', 'report', 'decision', 'follow', 'similar', 'action', 'university', 'wyoming', 'boise', 'state', 'university', 'southern', 'utah', 'university', 'drop', 'match', 'california', 'team', 'past', 'week']",

just recently, a transgender athlete (biological male) was “victorious” in a women’s darts event that took place in the netherlands, bringing a second straight championship to noa-lynn van leuven. the competition happened in the professional darts corporation (pdc), and to make this situation worse, the entity is celebrating van leuven’s “win.”

what’s funny about the celebration from pdc is the fact that they have comments disabled on their twitter account, pretty much admitting what they’re doing is wrong. they knew they were going to get hit with criticism. (related: linda mcmahon issues warning to ‘entities that continue to allow men to compete in women’s sports’)

per the official website of pdc, “the 28-year-old conceded just five legs on her way to event nine glory at the autotron, closing out an emphatic 5-0 victory over stefanie lueck to clinch a first women’s series crown of 2025.”

pdc also notes that the “victory marked van leuven’s sixth women’s series title, which equals the tally of japanese star mikuru suzuki.”

except… van leuven isn’t a woman.

this is why top-tier europeans come to america. not only can they make far more money in the united states, but at least we’re doing something about the transgender nonsense courtesy of the trump administration.

the guidelines come out in response to president donald trump’s ban on most transgender troops last march. after numerous challenges, a federal court judge ruled last week that the administration can continue with the partial ban. (related: pentagon to activate transgender military ban after judge removes block)

the ban places an increased focus on the transgender community as more people speak out for and against the new policy. as more voices from the transgender community are heard, their particular terminology is entering public consciousness.

law enforcement arrested approximately 15 demonstrators protesting against republican house speaker mike johnson’s recent ban on biological men entering bathrooms and facilities of the female sex, according to axios.

video shows a crowd of protesters clog a hall near a women’s bathroom while holding signs. this took place in the cannon house office building close to johnson’s office. one sign read, “congress stop pissing on our rights!”

johnson’s bathroom ban issued to protect women’s spaces from infiltrating males came after republican south carolina rep. nancy mace raised the issue by introducing a bill before democratic delaware representative-elect sarah mcbride — the first ever representative to identify as transgender — is sworn in. (related: nancy mace introduces bill to block trans woman from capitol bathrooms)

the activist group echoed chants of “speaker johnson, nancy mace,” “our bodies are not debate” and “our genders are not debate.”

chelsea manning was among the pro-transgender activists occupying the women’s bathroom, according to axios. it is unknown whether authorities took manning into custody.

democrats were not off the hook when it came to the issue as protesters chanted, “democrats, grow a spine! trans rights are on the line.”

a transgender activist posted a video on social media while appearing to use the women’s bathroom. “meeting in the ladies room at the us capital,” tiktok user realtaychatlc wrote in the caption to the video.

“i’m coming in the ladies room to shake the dew off my lily. i’m gonna shake the dew off my lily. i’m gonna pop a squat. i swear, nothing bad’s gonna happen. i’m just going pee,” the user said on camera, shutting the stall door and sitting down. “so i’m sitting in the toilet, and i’m going pee. i know this is newsworthy. i don’t know why. but i just wanted to let you know that everything’s coming out okay. and i hope you have a really nice day.”

the women’s bathroom blockage was organized by the gender liberation movement, which issued a statement saying the protest “sets an example of the righteous defiance and solidarity needed under a second trump administration.“

“everyone deserves to use the restroom without fear of discrimination or violence. trans folks are no different. we deserve dignity and respect and we will fight until we get it,” glm co-founder raquel willis said.

mace delivered a “special message” — megaphone in hand — to demonstrators in a video posted on x after the arrests were made.

“you have the right to remain silent. anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law,” mace spoke into the megaphone. “you have the right to speak to an attorney [and have an attorney] present during any question. if you cannot afford an attorney — i doubt many of you can — one will be provided to you at the government’s expense.”","['transgender', 'activist', 'take', 'woman', 'bathroom', 'thursday', 'capitol', 'hill', 'law', 'enforcement', 'arrest', 'approximately', 'demonstrator', 'protest', 'republican', 'house', 'speaker', 'mike', 'johnson', 'recent', 'ban', 'biological', 'man', 'enter', 'bathroom', 'facility', 'female', 'sex', 'accord', 'axios', 'video', 'show', 'crowd', 'protester', 'clog', 'hall', 'near', 'woman', 'bathroom', 'hold', 'sign', 'take', 'place', 'cannon', 'house', 'office', 'building', 'close', 'johnson', 'office', 'sign', 'read', 'congress', 'stop', 'piss', 'right', 'johnson', 'bathroom', 'ban', 'issue', 'protect', 'woman', 'space', 'infiltrate', 'male', 'come', 'republican', 'south', 'carolina', 'rep', 'nancy', 'mace', 'raise', 'issue', 'introduce', 'bill', 'democratic', 'delaware', 'representative', 'elect', 'sarah', 'mcbride', 'representative', 'identify', 'transgender', 'swear', 'related', 'nancy', 'mace', 'introduce', 'bill', 'block', 'trans', 'woman', 'capitol', 'bathroom', 'activist', 'group', 'echo', 'chant', 'speaker', 'johnson', 'nancy', 'mace', 'body', 'debate', 'gender', 'debate', 'chelsea', 'manning', 'pro', 'transgender', 'activist', 'occupy', 'woman', 'bathroom', 'accord', 'axios', 'unknown', 'authority', 'take', 'man', 'custody', 'democrats', 'hook', 'come', 'issue', 'protester', 'chant', 'democrat', 'grow', 'spine', 'tran', 'right', 'line', 'transgender', 'activist', 'post', 'video', 'social', 'medium', 'appear', 'use', 'woman', 'bathroom', 'meet', 'lady', 'room', 'capital', 'tiktok', 'user', 'realtaychatlc', 'write', 'caption', 'video', 'come', 'lady', 'room', 'shake', 'dew', 'lily', 'go', 'to', 'shake', 'dew', 'lily', 'go', 'to', 'pop', 'squat', 'swear', 'bad', 'go', 'to', 'happen', 'go', 'pee', 'user', 'say', 'camera', 'shut', 'stall', 'door', 'sit', 'sit', 'toilet', 'go', 'pee', 'know', 'newsworthy', 'know', 'want', 'let', 'know', 'come', 'okay', 'hope', 'nice', 'day', 'woman', 'bathroom', 'blockage', 'organize', 'gender', 'liberation', 'movement', 'issue', 'statement', 'say', 'protest', 'set', 'example', 'righteous', 'defiance', 'solidarity', 'need', 'second', 'trump', 'administration', 'deserve', 'use', 'restroom', 'fear', 'discrimination', 'violence', 'trans', 'folk', 'different', 'deserve', 'dignity', 'respect', 'fight', 'glm', 'co', 'founder', 'raquel', 'willis', 'say', 'mace', 'deliver', 'special', 'message', 'megaphone', 'hand', 'demonstrator', 'video', 'post', 'x', 'arrest', 'protestor', 'come', 'capitol', 'today', 'protest', 'bathroom', 'bill', 'poor', 'thing', 'get', 'arrest', 'special', 'message', 'nancy', 'mace', 'december', 'tranny', 'protester', 'show', 'capitol', 'today', 'protest', 'bathroom', 'bill', 'get', 'arrest', 'poor', 'thing', 'message', 'protester', 'get', 'arrest', 'ready', 'congresswoman', 'say', 'raise', 'megaphone', 'right', 'remain', 'silent', 'court', 'law', 'mace', 'speak', 'megaphone', 'right', 'speak', 'attorney', 'attorney', 'present', 'question', 'afford', 'attorney', 'doubt', 'provide', 'government', 'expense']",

during the discussion hosted by peterson, the psychologist brought up musk’s recent move to pull his company’s headquarters, spacex, from california after democratic gov. gavin newsom signed the new assembly bill 1955, which allows schools to refrain from notifying parents of their child’s sexuality or gender identity. musk explained his decision on the move, leading to peterson questioning him on why he was willing to make “gender affirming care” an “issue.” (related: elon musk says spacex headquarters is moving out of california after new lgbt law)

“it happened to one of my older boys, where i was essentially tricked into signing documents for one of my older boys, xavier. this was before i really had any understanding of what was going on. we had covid going on,” musk said. “i was told xavier might commit suicide.”

“that was a lie right from the outset,” peterson responded. “no reliable clinician ever believed that. there was never any evidence for that, and also if there’s a higher suicide rate, the reason is because the underlying depression and anxiety, not because of the gender dysphoria. and every goddamn clinician knows that.”

peterson continued to call out clinicians, stating he couldn’t “imagine anything worse” for a parent.

“it’s incredibly evil, and i agree with you that the people promoting this should go to prison,” musk said.

“so i was tricked into doing this. it wasn’t explained to me that puberty blockers are actually just sterilization drugs,” musk continued. “so i lost my son essentially. they call it dead naming for a reason. the reason it’s called dead naming is because your son is dead. so my son xavier is dead, killed by the woke mind virus.”

musk had first discussed his son’s transition at 16 years old last year in a biography by walter isaacson, explaining how xavier had first texted musk’s brother about the transition, asking not to relay the information to the billionaire, according to the book. while musk first responded to the change in a mostly positive manner, xavier had cut off his father after he became a communist.

since the incident, musk has called out california’s policies around sex-change procedures and medication for minors and blamed his child’s ideology on the progressive los angeles school, crossroads, which xavier attended at the time.

following newsom’s approval of ab 1955 last week, musk called the action his “last straw” in a statement on x and accused california of passing several laws “attacking both families and companies.”","['billionaire', 'elon', 'musk', 'open', 'monday', 'biological', 'son', 'come', 'transgender', 'tell', 'prominent', 'canadian', 'psychologist', 'jordan', 'peterson', 'son', 'kill', 'woke', 'mind', 'virus', 'discussion', 'host', 'peterson', 'psychologist', 'bring', 'musk', 'recent', 'pull', 'company', 'headquarters', 'spacex', 'california', 'democratic', 'gov', 'gavin', 'newsom', 'sign', 'new', 'assembly', 'bill', 'allow', 'school', 'refrain', 'notify', 'parent', 'child', 'sexuality', 'gender', 'identity', 'musk', 'explain', 'decision', 'lead', 'peterson', 'question', 'willing', 'gender', 'affirming', 'care', 'issue', 'relate', 'elon', 'musk', 'say', 'spacex', 'headquarters', 'move', 'california', 'new', 'lgbt', 'law', 'happen', 'old', 'boy', 'essentially', 'trick', 'sign', 'document', 'old', 'boy', 'xavier', 'understanding', 'go', 'covid', 'go', 'musk', 'say', 'tell', 'xavi', 'commit', 'suicide', 'lie', 'right', 'outset', 'peterson', 'respond', 'reliable', 'clinician', 'believe', 'evidence', 'high', 'suicide', 'rate', 'reason', 'underlie', 'depression', 'anxiety', 'gender', 'dysphoria', 'goddamn', 'clinician', 'know', 'peterson', 'continue', 'clinician', 'state', 'imagine', 'bad', 'parent', 'incredibly', 'evil', 'agree', 'people', 'promote', 'prison', 'musk', 'say', 'trick', 'explain', 'puberty', 'blocker', 'actually', 'sterilization', 'drug', 'musk', 'continue', 'lose', 'son', 'essentially', 'dead', 'name', 'reason', 'reason', 'call', 'dead', 'naming', 'son', 'dead', 'son', 'xavier', 'dead', 'kill', 'woke', 'mind', 'virus', 'musk', 'discuss', 'son', 'transition', 'year', 'old', 'year', 'biography', 'walter', 'isaacson', 'explain', 'xavi', 'texte', 'musk', 'brother', 'transition', 'ask', 'relay', 'information', 'billionaire', 'accord', 'book', 'musk', 'respond', 'change', 'positive', 'manner', 'xavier', 'cut', 'father', 'communist', 'incident', 'musk', 'call', 'california', 'policy', 'sex', 'change', 'procedure', 'medication', 'minor', 'blame', 'child', 'ideology', 'progressive', 'los', 'angeles', 'school', 'crossroad', 'xavier', 'attend', 'time', 'follow', 'newsom', 'approval', 'ab', 'week', 'musk', 'call', 'action', 'straw', 'statement', 'x', 'accuse', 'california', 'pass', 'law', 'attack', 'family', 'company']",

“honestly this one came as a bit of a surprise to me,” davidson wrote. “being 3 shots back with two holes to play i got myself into a playoff after sticking it to 3 feet on the 18th hole. we tied the first playoff hole with a birdie and then a par on the second earned me my first win in 2.5 years!”

a video is going viral of a teenager in california crying while explaining what she felt from having to participate against a transgender in female sports. and get this: the president of the school board attempted to block the pure emotion out.

the scene went down wednesday in arroyo grande, california, while the lucia mar unified school district (lmusd) board was holding a meeting. celeste diest, a junior who competes on the arroyo grande high school girls’ track team, testified to the board about what she’s been experiencing around a trans athlete.

diest talked about the embarrassment that she’s been through being forced to share a locker room with a male, saying that the trans athlete looked at her and her teammates while they were getting undressed. (related: illinois joins list of states who are refusing to comply with trump’s executive order on trans athletes)

“i went into the women’s locker room to change for track practice where i saw, at the end of my row, a biological male watching not only myself, but the other young women undress. this experience was beyond traumatizing,” said diest while crying.

“okay, please wrap it up,” warned lmusd board president colleen martin, interrupting diest while she was speaking

“i just want to ask, ‘what about us?'” continued diest. “we cannot sit around and allow our rights to be given up to cater to an individual that is a man, who watches women undress and is stripping away female opportunity that once was fought for us. sadly we have to try and regain our rights back. i hope you put effort into the restoration of our school safety.”

(related: nebraska’s stand with women act opposed by faith leaders)

the few pols who have woken up and smelled the polling have proved to be lonely — and abandoned — figures. maybe it takes an 80–20 split on an issue — 80 percent for banning; 20 percent against — to get gavin newsom’s attention, but the california governor called trans participation in women’s sports “deeply unfair.” congressman seth moulton (d-ma) told the new york times he didn’t want his two little girls “run over on a playing field by a male or formerly male athlete,” and his fellow representative tim suozzi (d-ny) said he doesn’t “think biological boys should be playing in girls’ sports.” (related: gavin goes ‘soul-searching’)

anyone hoping this ripple would grow into a tsunami of common sense is disappointed, however. a tsunami of a different sort — of blowback — mussed newsom’s hairdo. and moulton collapsed like the ‘78 red sox, voting against a house bill that banned exactly what he didn’t want to see — male athletes running over little girls on a playing field.

elsewhere, dems have doubled down on their contrarian position. maine gov. janet mills, who got into it with president trump at the white house over males playing women’s sports in her state, defied a trump executive order and got her state denied federal school funding (the issue is now in the courts). minnesota says it won’t comply with trump’s eo, and the california assembly recently voted down bills banning transgender participation in women’s sports in the golden state. (related: trump’s executive order ends ‘trans’ tyranny and protects females)

the question is why. why cannot dems bring themselves to abandon such a transparently destructive political position?

well, there is the backlash. we mentioned the hurricane-force winds of disdain newsom’s coiffure had to endure, but moulton also faced tirades from fellow democrats for simply saying the party should be broad-minded enough to at least discuss the issue. state party chair steve kerrigan said moulton’s comments “do not represent the broad view of our party.”

that seems to be true. bills banning guys in girls’ sports were voted against in the house and the senate by every single democrat.

but avoiding backlash is a political calculation. others blame another political creation — the primary system, which mandates that candidates for office cater to a base more extreme than common sentiment. if you want to get the dem nomination, you have to mollify the screamers.

the left’s stubbornness on this issue, however, seems more ideological than pragmatic. said rep. summer lee (d-pa), “there is no poll result that could make me turn on marginalized people.” she added, “[t]hrowing anybody in our coalition under the bus just simply cannot be the answer.”

michael baharaeen, writing at the liberal patriot, says transgenders’ vulnerable status ingratiates them with the liberal cause, the more so because “many democrats have become convinced that conservatives — at least a lot of them — always seem to be in need of a group to pick on.” liberals see transgenders as the latest in a string of embattled minorities and are determined to offer balls-to-the-wall support of “women” who have them.

and once you go full throttle on civil rights, you can’t easily lay off the gas. leor sapir in city journal contended, “rights claims are by their nature absolutist and uncompromising.” he elaborated,

    [t]he reality is that embracing rights claims, in lieu of sober policy analysis, has become a deeply embedded feature of contemporary liberalism. that shift has been institutionalized across american society, from universities to corporate board rooms, from public schools to the military, from the interlocking layers of state and federal bureaucracies to the information superhighways of google and ai. it is precisely why democrats will struggle to walk back their support for radical transgender policies.

    democrats spent years lecturing the public that boys’ participation in girls’ sports and mastectomies for teen girls who identify as boys are non-negotiable “civil rights.” if they change course now, they will either have to admit they were wrong before or become rights-violators by their own definition.

transgenderism has seen considerable “success” in the past 15 years. it has been instituted in the policies of the department of human services; it has been enshrined in public schools; bathroom and locker-room rules permitting transgenders to use the facilities corresponding to their “gender identity” have been passed all over the country; title ix was altered by the biden administration to include gender identity among those rights protected from discrimination in education; and the public debate has been controlled by a left-wing press that has adopted the lingo and the views of the transgender world.

this victorious march through the institutions has made leftists think they will eventually turn public opinion. after all, that’s what happened with gay marriage.

following decades of censure and obloquy — from homosexuals’ days as putative perverts in the 1960s to their portrayal as tragic figures during the aids crisis of the ‘80s and ‘90s — gay causes started gaining public approval toward the end of the last century. a gallup poll from 1996 revealed 27 percent of americans thought same-sex marriage should be valid, versus 68 percent that didn’t. in 2010, those numbers were 44 percent for and 53 percent against. around the obergefell decision (2015), it was 60–37, and in 2024, 69–29. the current numbers are even higher in younger cohorts.

the numbers on the trans issue are going the other way, however. whereas sentiment against homosexuality softened as people became more comfortable with it — through contact with gay people, for example — opinions about transgenderism have hardened with increased contact and education. while 54 percent of americans thought sex was defined at birth in 2017, 60 percent believe it now. and the now-well-known 80 percent of americans against biological men competing in women’s sports is up from 67 percent just two years ago.

the more americans learn about the transgender issue — of transgender motives, of surgeries for minors, of youthful indoctrination, of schoolkids coming home with new names and pronouns, of health officials playing politics on trans issues — the less they like it.

the wonder of it is that democrats don’t respond to this new reality.

allowing men to play women’s sports, like supporting ms-13 gang members, to the point of rescuing them from el salvadoran prisons to bring them “home,” is a democrat ‘own goal.’ (related: five quick things: the hill they’ve died on)

we can only hope they continue to kick the political ball into their own net.","['despite', 'highly', 'publicize', 'climb', 'down', 'prominent', 'liberal', 'politician', 'wake', 'election', 'exit',

massachusetts rep. seth moulton said he doesn’t want to see his young daughters “getting run over” by a male athlete. california gov. gavin newsom said that it is “deeply unfair” to have male athletes in women’s sports. (related: is the transgender movement really backing down?)

and now, we also have rahm emanuel. the former ambassador to japan and mayor of chicago broke from transgender orthodoxy in perhaps the most blustery way possible. “look,” he said, “in seventh grade, if i had known that i could have said the word ‘they’ and got in the girls’ bathroom, i would have done it.”

those comments, which he made on the anti-woke-but-left-leaning real time with bill maher, followed earlier comments he made in which he said democrats should be focused on improving educational outcomes rather than on bathrooms and locker rooms. (related: dissatisfied democrats voice frustrations with party line on transgender issues)

rahm emanuel’s break from transgender orthodoxy is particularly notable for its boldness. he isn’t just walking back the idea of allowing biological boys in girls’ locker rooms, he is — through humor — questioning the whole ideology.

according to politico’s jonathan martin, this is all part of an effort to set up a run for the presidency. martin posited that emanuel’s biggest liability in such an endeavor would be that he “reeks of yesterday.” but by bucking the democratic consensus on unpopular areas with provocative and headline-making comments, emanuel is hoping that he can break from the pack and distinguish himself as a leader of the party’s new direction. (related: five quick things: welcome to the briar patch, chuck schumer)

indeed, emanuel has sought to push toward the center in a number of other ways in recent weeks, including on urban crime. he told maher: “we’ve gone through five years where people became way too permissive as a culture — which is why everything is locked up at cvs and walgreens, and that’s a disaster.”

meanwhile, most of the democratic party is still tied in a knot over transgenderism, and they are too afraid to break free. this includes maine gov. janet mills, who recently doubled down on keeping men in women’s sports, and kentucky gov. andy beshear, who recently pledged to veto a bill that would nullify his executive order banning children from receiving therapy to help them accept their biological sex.

for years, democrats have proclaimed that it is bigoted for anyone or any law to treat someone who identifies as transgender as anything less than a full and complete member of their opposite biological sex. yet public opinion has shifted, with americans now opposing the presence of men in women’s bathrooms, locker rooms, prisons, and sports teams. (nearly 80 percent of americans oppose allowing men in women’s sports, according to a recent new york times poll.)

if democrats back down, they will be endorsing actions they condemned as bigoted just months ago. they will also be crossing a big red line in the democrats’ unofficial moral code by refuting the notion that transgender identities should be “affirmed” in every way by society.

let’s step back and consider how democrats got into this kerfuffle. the primary reason is that they have become stuck in the clutches of progressive advocacy organizations, think tanks, policy institutes, and lobbying groups.

a january tell-all by vanity fair on the collapse of the democratic party termed these organizations simply “the groups.” many on the center-left, the essay asserted, believe “the groups” are “the reason why democrats are now so nervous about breaking even slightly with the consensus of the party.”(related: the democratic party is collapsing)

an essay in the atlantic last month likewise laid the blame for the democratic party’s travails at the feet of “the groups.” the groups, it asserted, “have managed to amass enormous influence over the party” even though they “seldom have a broad base of support.” the atlantic essay explained that the groups do so by “monopolizing the brand value of various causes,” including climate change, abortion, and racial justice. this means they are able to “define” what the democratic party’s policies should be on the issues, particularly through the dissemination of their ideas via progressive journalists.

interestingly, the atlantic takes the 2020 democratic primary as the crux of the groups’ power. it explains: “the gigantic field of candidates slogged through a series of debates and interviews in which journalists asked if they would affirm various positions demanded by the groups.” for me, this brings to mind planned parenthood’s 2019 “forum on reproductive rights,” at which 16 democratic presidential candidates came out to parrot exactly what the abortion advocacy group wanted to hear. likewise, the lgbtq-focused human rights campaign hosted an october 2019 event for democratic presidential candidates at which kamala harris introduced herself by saying, “my pronouns are she, her, and hers.”

the priorities of these activist groups simply do not represent those of the democratic party writ large. by recognizing this and breaking from the elite consensus — as emanuel has now done on transgenderism — democrats could theoretically give themselves a major political boost.

but “the groups” still have the democratic party in their clutches, and defying them presents major risks.

when gavin newsom came out to oppose men in women’s sports, the human rights campaign released a statement suggesting that his comments “make it seem like gov. newsom believes our civil rights are up for grabs.” two members of the state legislature additionally said they were “profoundly sickened and frustrated” by the governor’s comments.

likewise, emanuel’s comments invited a band of radicals to come forward and attack him.

“i cannot think of another democrat more unsuited to the current political moment than rahm fcking emanuel, whose only real political gift is alienating members of his party’s political base,” wrote charles p. pierce in esquire.

the enduring influence of “the groups” can be seen in the fact that no democrats have switched their stance on transgenderism beyond rhetoric. california continues to allow men in women’s sports, keeps men in women’s prisons, promises to shield children who identify as transgender from parents who oppose medical transition treatments, and bans schools from revealing a transgender identity to parents without a child’s permission. likewise, no democrats in the house or senate joined republicans in voting to ban men from women’s sports earlier this year. (related: the democratic party is collapsing)

what seems certain is that the first democrat who can successfully defy this elite class of ideologues — in reality, and not just rhetoric — without losing the party’s support stands a major chance of winning the nomination come 2028. moulton, newsom, and emanuel are unlikely to be the only ones to try.

the democratic presidential debate stage — which will feature candidates who choose to defy “the groups” and those who stick with them — is going to be fiery.","['democrats', 'decide', 'jig', 'time',

deadd975-93f3-4c13-878f-06e5938d5493,anti,detrans awareness day comes with a warning,"['detrans', 'awareness', 'day', 'come', 'warning']",the american spectator,debra j. saunders,https://spectator.org/detrans-awareness-day-comes-with-a-warning/,3/12/2025,"washington — “i realized i am a guinea pig,” forrest smith said of his transition from male to female at age 19. after five years, smith detransitioned. he spoke about his personal journey at a briefing on capitol hill on wednesday, march 12, detrans awareness day, first celebrated in 2021 to promote awareness of individuals who realized they were wrong to try to change their genders.

now 29, smith recognized his place as a member of the first generation of kids who grew up with unfettered access to the internet, where he discovered erotic cartoons. the online experience “shaped my sexuality” and “steered me toward fetish pornography,” he said.

smith started cross dressing, dropped out of college, and was living on the streets when he began to pursue transitioning from male to female.

at an event sponsored by genspect, which advocates for “a non-medicalized approach to gender-related distress,” as well as the heritage foundation and ethics and public policy center, smith noted that he once thought his parents’ failure to see him as a trans girl was a form of “abuse.”

after five years, which included the surgical removal of his testicles and top surgery (breast augmentation), smith realized that he had taken the wrong path. he detransitioned, but he’ll never get back the body he had before treatment.

smith can never sire children and now describes himself as “an amputee.”

chloe cole, now 20, transitioned at 15. she spoke of having mental health challenges, as well as autism. after she was diagnosed with gender dysphoria, cole took cross-sex puberty blockers and had a double mastectomy.

“if it weren’t for me using social media as an adolescent, i don’t think i ever would have transitioned, let alone, believed i was a boy,” cole told the panel.

in this brave new online world, teens who express interest in switching genders can find themselves sucked into “the pipeline” — as detransitioners call it — that quickly conveys teens with doubts about their sexuality into the transitioning machine, despite the lack of research you’d expect for irrevocable treatments.

left-wing partisans like to say they believe in — all bow — the science. yet, former texas democratic lawmaker (now a republican) shawn thierry observed, “suddenly they threw all that science out the window.”

where do i stand? i have sympathy for anyone who feels trapped in the wrong body, and i support adults’ rights to choose elective surgery. but first, there should be more disclosure, debate, and frank discussions about what can go wrong when nipples or genitalia are removed.

last year, british pediatrician hilary cass looked at gender identity services for children and young people and found that u.k. treatments were built on “shaky foundations.”

in america, even transition surgeries that sterilize children and young adults with mental health issues have been approved by the medical establishment without rigorous examination.

“i can’t think of another area of pediatric care where we give young people a potentially irreversible treatment and have no idea what happens to them in adulthood,” cass told the bmj.

panelist and plastic surgeon patrick lappert sees the medical establishment’s approval of transgender treatments, including surgeries, as one of the many reasons americans trust doctors less than they used to. this isn’t science. it isn’t medicine. it’s human experimentation.","['washington', 'realize', 'guinea', 'pig', 'forrest', 'smith', 'say', 'transition', 'male', 'female', 'age', 'year', 'smith', 'detransitione', 'speak', 'personal', 'journey', 'briefing', 'capitol', 'hill', 'wednesday', 'march', 'detran', 'awareness', 'day', 'celebrate', 'promote', 'awareness', 'individual', 'realize', 'wrong', 'try', 'change', 'gender', 'smith', 'recognize', 'place', 'member', 'generation', 'kid', 'grow', 'unfettered', 'access', 'internet', 'discover', 'erotic', 'cartoon', 'online', 'experience', 'shape', 'sexuality', 'steer', 'fetish', 'pornography', 'say', 'smith', 'start', 'cross', 'dressing', 'drop', 'college', 'live', 'street', 'begin', 'pursue', 'transition', 'male', 'female', 'event', 'sponsor', 'genspect', 'advocate', 'non', 'medicalized', 'approach', 'gender', 'relate', 'distress', 'heritage', 'foundation', 'ethic', 'public', 'policy', 'center', 'smith', 'note', 'think', 'parent', 'failure', 'trans', 'girl', 'form', 'abuse', 'year', 'include', 'surgical', 'removal', 'testicle', 'surgery', 'breast', 'augmentation', 'smith', 'realize', 'take', 'wrong', 'path', 'detransitione', 'body', 'treatment', 'smith', 'sire', 'child', 'describe', 'amputee', 'chloe', 'cole', 'transition', 'speak', 'have', 'mental', 'health', 'challenge', 'autism', 'diagnose', 'gender', 'dysphoria', 'cole', 'take', 'cross', 'sex', 'puberty', 'blocker', 'double', 'mastectomy', 'social', 'medium', 'adolescent', 'think', 'transition', 'let', 'believe', 'boy', 'cole', 'tell', 'panel', 'brave', 'new', 'online', 'world', 'teen', 'express', 'interest', 'switch', 'gender', 'find', 'suck', 'pipeline', 'detransitioner', 'quickly', 'convey', 'teen', 'doubt', 'sexuality', 'transition', 'machine', 'despite', 'lack', 'research', 'expect', 'irrevocable', 'treatment', 'leave', 'wing', 'partisan', 'like', 'believe', 'bow', 'science', 'texas', 'democratic', 'lawmaker', 'republican', 'shawn', 'thierry', 'observe', 'suddenly', 'throw', 'science', 'window', 'stand', 'sympathy', 'feel', 'trap', 'wrong', 'body', 'support', 'adult', 'right', 'choose', 'elective', 'surgery', 'disclosure', 'debate', 'frank', 'discussion', 'wrong', 'nipple', 'genitalia', 'remove', 'year', 'british', 'pediatrician', 'hilary', 'cass', 'look', 'gender', 'identity', 'service', 'child', 'young', 'people', 'find', 'treatment', 'build', 'shaky', 'foundation', 'america', 'transition', 'surgery', 'sterilize', 'child', 'young', 'adult', 'mental', 'health', 'issue', 'approve', 'medical', 'establishment', 'rigorous', 'examination', 'think', 'area', 'pediatric', 'care', 'young', 'people', 'potentially', 'irreversible', 'treatment', 'idea', 'happen', 'adulthood', 'cass', 'tell', 'bmj', 'panelist', 'plastic', 'surgeon', 'patrick', 'lappert', 'see', 'medical', 'establishment', 'approval', 'transgender', 'treatment', 'include', 'surgery', 'reason', 'americans', 'trust', 'doctor', 'science', 'medicine', 'human', 'experimentation']",

(related: trump protects children from woke abuse: new executive order bans chemical and surgical mutilation)
the trump administration purifies the executive branch of “gender ideology”

on jan. 29, the office of personnel management sent out a memo to all the heads of departments and agencies, telling them to end the promotion of “gender ideology” (the idea that males can become female and females male) in accordance with trump’s eo “defending women from gender ideology extremism and restoring biological truth to the federal government,” and to do so by friday, jan. 31 at 5 p.m. (read more: trump’s executive order ends ‘trans’ tyranny and protects females)

the scope and speed of the transgender housecleaning was impressive:

    take down all federal websites or information within them that promote gender ideology.
    terminate “all agency programs, contracts, and grants” and withdraw any regulations or directives that “promote … gender ideology.”
    require all federal employees to remove pronouns from their email signatures.
    “ensure that intimate spaces … are designated by biological sex and not gender identity.” no more biological males in female restrooms.
    cancel any training that promotes gender ideology — no more struggle sessions.
    remove from all documents “gender” or “gender identity” and replace with “sex,” allowing only the binary option of “male” or “female.”
    put on “paid administrative leave” “all employees whose position description involves … promoting gender ideology.”

compliance with the memo was reached by the deadline. naturally, the left-wing media went into spasms over this memo (for examples go here, here, here, and here). yet it was a boldly positive move for the country, which is growing increasingly tired of having to violate reason, conscience, and faith, not to mention endanger women and children, in order to appease the transgender idol.

my only regret is that the promotion of “sexual orientation” did not incur the same fate as “gender identity.”
the first fruits of trump’s executive order combatting trans child abuse

the second new (and positive) development was celebrated by the white house in a statement released on feb. 3., trump’s executive order “protecting children from chemical and surgical mutilation” was “already having its intended effect — preventing children from being maimed and sterilized by adults perpetuating a radical, false claim that they can somehow change a child’s sex.”

hospitals were the most impacted by the executive order: “hospitals around the country are taking action to downsize or eliminate their so-called ‘gender-affirming care’ programs.” the following are cases in point:

    denver health in colorado, while obviously not wanting to comply with trump’s eo, recognized in a jan. 30 statement that they had little choice in the matter, since the eo

    includes criminal and financial consequences for those who do not comply, including placing participation in federal programs including medicare, medicaid and other programs administered by hhs at risk. these programs represent a significant portion of denver health’s funding…. the loss of this funding would critically impair our ability to provide care for the denver community.

how much is “a significant portion”? about $350 million per year in lost funding for denver health. money talks even to transgender advocates who normally lack “the ears to hear.”

    other hospitals that have “paused” or “suspended” the use of puberty blockers, cross-gender hormones, and transgender surgery on minors include: children’s national hospital in washington, d.c.; children’s hospital of richmond, va and virginia commonwealth university health; and “children’s hospital of the king’s daughters” in norfolk, va.
    new york city’s nyu langone health, “one of several major medical centers in the city with transgender health programs for youths,” reportedly began canceling puberty-blocking arm implants for 12-year-olds. new york has a huge “transgender child” problem from its coercive trans-indoctrination of children in the schools and the media. according to the new york times, a whopping 3 percent of children aged 13 to 17 in the state of new york identify as transgender.

democrats strike back in an attempt to reinstate chemical castration of children

the third new development is a negative one: an attempt by democrats to reinstate the destruction of children’s bodies. this has taken two forms.

first, new york’s notorious attorney general, letitia james, sent a letter on feb. 3 threatening hospitals with prosecution for violating the state’s anti-discrimination laws regarding “gender identity” as a protected class if they don’t continue dispensing puberty blockers and cross-gender hormones to children. james is determined to continue the practice of state-sponsored child abuse, lying to impressionable children about whether they can switch sexes, transitioning them to lifelong sterility and gender freakishness without any thought for how neurological, psychological, and sociological factors may be fueling their gender dysphoria.

second, two democrat federal district court judges have issued temporary restraining orders designed to thwart trump’s attempt to manage federal funding consistent with his eos. one restraining order was issued on jan. 31 by the judge of the u.s. district court of rhode island, john mcconnell, an obama appointee, in response to a lawsuit brought by democratic state attorneys general.

the complaint had to do with the office of management and budget’s general freeze on federal assistance to the states until a review of federal programs and policies could be made. the judge ruled that, until further order of the court, the federal government will not be able to “stop, delay, or otherwise withhold federal financial assistance programs” to the states.

on feb. 3, the u.s. district court judge for the district of columbia, loren alikhan, a biden appointee, in response to a lawsuit brought by nonprofits, issued a similar (but even more hostile) temporary restraining order. she indicated that the trump administration would likely be ruled against for not “taking a measured approach to identify purportedly wasteful spending.” according to the acting director for the office of management and budget, these rulings may affect trump’s eos, including “financial assistance for … dei, woke gender ideology, and the green new deal,” pending further clarity by these judges.

it remains to be seen how this will all pan out. not every issue is straightforward and obvious. this one is: the protection of children from the harmful clutches of transgender activism is a clear case of good. the pursuit of children by leftist sexual extremists, scarring children for life and destroying biological realities, is an obvious instance of evil.","['trump', 'turnaround', 'policy',

4c4640b2-ca6e-4201-a9a1-6b8ba30131df,anti,trump’s executive order ends ‘trans’ tyranny and protects females,"['trump', 'executive', 'order', 'end', 'trans', 'tyranny', 'protect', 'female']",the american spectator,robert gagnon,https://spectator.org/trump-executive-order-end-trans-tyranny-protect/,1/22/2025,"thanks to donald trump’s new executive order, entitled “defending women from gender ideology extremism and restoring biological truth to the federal government,” the federal government is no longer coming after you for not recognizing “transwomen” as women or “transmen” as men in schools, workplaces, and public accommodations.

this is a major about-face from the biden–harris administration’s insidious promotion of all things “trans,” endangering children (indoctrination, chemical castration, “trans” mutilation surgery), females (privacy and safety), and faithful christians everywhere (mandatory speech requirements in employment and education).
trump’s fidelity to his election promise

trump was true to his commitment over a year ago to work against the “left-wing gender insanity being pushed on our children [which] is an act of child abuse” and “to stop the chemical, physical, and emotional mutilation of our youth.” the executive order fleshed out what was arguably the greatest line in his inaugural address: “as of today, it will henceforth be the official policy of the united states government that there are only two genders, male and female.”

this one action alone justifies the outcome of the election (there are, of course, other reasons) because the eradication of any non-circular definition of “woman” and “man” (or “male” and “female”) does inestimable damage to this most essential element of human civilization.
description of the problem for women

the opening “purpose” section artfully summarizes the problem by presenting it as a problem for women: “ideologues who deny the biological reality of sex have … used … coercive means to permit men to … gain access to intimate single-sex spaces … designed for women…. this is wrong.” such efforts “attack women by depriving them of their dignity, safety, and well-being.” moreover, “basing federal policy on truth is critical to scientific inquiry, public safety, morale, and trust in government itself.”

trump’s executive order rightfully pinpoints the locus of confusion as “replacing the immutable biological reality of sex with an internal, fluid, and subjective sense of self unmoored from biological facts.” the sad result is that laws originally designed to protect women are perverted to “undermine them, replacing longstanding, cherished legal rights and values with an identity-based, inchoate social concept.”

in order to preserve the original intent of legislation to protect women, the government has no choice but to revert back to a biologically based definition of what a woman is and what a man is. “accordingly, my administration will defend women’s rights and protect freedom of conscience by using clear and accurate language and policies that recognize women are biologically female, and men are biologically male.”
definition of “sex” and of “male” and “female”

the second section of “policy and definitions” pulls the rug out from under the house of cards that stand atop “gender ideology” and “gender identity” by re-establishing a secure basis for “sex.”

under trump’s watch, the federal government will no longer define a “male” and “female” by subjective identity but solely by objective biological identity, i.e., by gametes or reproductive function. “‘female’ means a person belonging, at conception, to the sex that produces the large reproductive cell [i.e., egg cell or ovum]. ‘male’ means a person belonging, at conception, to the sex that produces the small reproductive cell [i.e., the sperm cell].”
impact on federal law and policy

sections 3 through 8 largely spell out the practical effects on federal policy and regulations of reverting back to biologically objective definitions of “sex” that are based on male-female reproductive complementarity.

perhaps the biggest hit was rescinding part of biden’s executive order, which had redefined the prohibition of “sex discrimination” in title ix of the educational amendments act to include not only “sexual orientation discrimination” but also “gender identity discrimination.” in schools that receive federal funding, males will no longer be allowed into female restrooms, locker rooms, female living facilities, and sports (the latter two were still being worked on at the time of the biden administration’s revisions to title ix in april 2024).

biden’s title ix executive order had recently faced challenges. with lawsuits from 26 republican attorneys general, the biden administration’s revision of title ix was on hold in their states. earlier this month, a federal judge ruled that biden’s revision was unconstitutional. last week, the house of representatives passed a bill prohibiting men from competing in women’s school sports. it now goes to the senate.

also according to trump’s new executive order, as regards facilities that receive federal funding, “males are not [to be] detained in women’s prisons or housed in women’s detention centers” or allowed into female-only “rape shelters.” and, “no federal funds are [to be] expended for any medical procedure, treatment, or drug for the purpose of conforming an inmate’s appearance to that of the opposite sex.”

“intimate spaces designated for women, girls, or females (or for men, boys, or males) are [to be ] designated by sex and not identity.” this would include, of course, restrooms, locker rooms, and showers.

“agencies shall remove all … regulations … that promote or otherwise inculcate gender ideology…. agencies shall take all necessary steps … to end the federal funding of gender ideology,” including in federal grants. “government-issued identification documents, including passports, visas, and global entry cards, [shall] accurately reflect the holder’s sex,” as also all “applicable personnel records.”

all federal guidance publications from previous administrations inconsistent with this new executive order are to be immediately rescinded, including (here i offer a selection of a much fuller list than in the executive order): “the white house toolkit on transgender equality”; “creating inclusive and nondiscriminatory school environments for lgbtqi+ students”; “supporting lgbtqi+ youth and families in school”; “supporting intersex students”; “supporting transgender youth in school”; “confronting anti-lgbtqi+ harassment in schools”; “enforcement of title ix … with respect to discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity in light of bostock v. clayton county”; “enforcement guidance on harassment [of lgbtqi+ persons] in the workplace” (april 29, 2024).

in addition, the attorney general is charged with issuing “guidance to ensure the freedom to express the binary nature of sex and the right to single-sex spaces in workplaces and federally funded entities covered by the civil rights act of 1964.” presumably, this would include protection for teachers in schools who decline to use “trans” pronouns for students, teachers, and staff.

undoubtedly, this executive order will be challenged in the courts, especially in relation to the supreme court’s decision in bostock v. clayton county (2020), which addressed title vii of the civil rights act of 1964. this underscores the importance of strong court appointments. the executive order would not affect areas over which the federal government does not have authority. but it is an excellent start to the trump administration.","['thank', 'donald', 'trump', 'new', 'executive', 'order', 'entitle', 'defend', 'woman', 'gender', 'ideology', 'extremism', 'restore', 'biological',

a816ed94-3e3e-4bb3-92f7-5db19fe22136,anti,judge raps pa school district for trans instruction,"['judge', 'rap', 'pa', 'school', 'district', 'trans', 'instruction']",the american spectator,thomas o'boyle,https://spectator.org/judge-raps-pa-school-district-for-trans-instruction/,10/19/2024,"mt. lebanon, pa., is a leafy suburb south of pittsburgh known for its quality of life and its fine public schools.

according to the educators who sit on blue-ribbon panels, the school district is among the best in pennsylvania if not the country. its graduates attend elite universities. and parents move to the district for the schools, surveys say. my wife and i moved there 35 years ago for just this reason.

    “there is no evidence in this [court] record of bullying, unkindness, or disrespect toward transgender students in the elementary school attended by the children of plaintiffs.”

but the vaunted mt. lebanon school district now finds itself on the losing end of a significant court decision over transgender education in its public schools. by embracing the radical idea that it was acceptable “teacher prerogative” to instruct first graders that their gender at birth could be wrong, the district staked out a position that was at odds with common decency, common sense, and common christian conviction.

the case began when megan williams, a first-grade teacher in the district’s jefferson elementary school spontaneously decided two years ago to observe transgender awareness day by reading noncurricular books which presented gender identity topics to her students. she then told her first-grade students: “when children are born, parents make a guess whether they’re a girl or a boy. sometimes parents are wrong.” some of the young children experienced confusion about how that topic personally affected them.

district superintendent timothy steinhauer (who has since retired) testified in the lengthy court discovery that accompanied the case, it was longstanding practice within the district to honor opt outs on subjects parents found objectionable. but the opt outs and prior notice were “always teacher prerogative.”

steinhauer testified: “we [the district] don’t have any specific guidelines for what you should notify parents about and not notify parents about.” steinhauer confirmed there were no written procedures on how or whether to notify parents.

but in this instance, past precedent was ignored. parents were not notified or given the option to opt out. the district unequivocally backed teacher williams’ own personal preference, which was colored by the fact that her own child of the same age was transitioning from boy to girl at the same time.

one former mt. lebanon teacher who still lives in the district finds the conduct the case revealed bewildering and appalling. “i’m glad the judge sided with the plaintiffs, but i am appalled at the school district,” she writes. “this is not the mt. lebanon that i grew up in, graduated from, raised my children in and taught in.” (read more: let’s just say it: transgenderism is a mental illness)

“when i retired from mt. lebanon, the school district always sided with the parents,” she adds. “we had to be so careful about what we said. this is just unbelievable. i am very disappointed in this town. mt. lebanon was always a conservative community. i’m very sorry to hear how mt lebanon has changed.”

likewise, it’s not a district my wife or i recognize anymore. i suspect, however, that’s a sentiment widely shared by many citizens across america whose trust in community schools has been shattered.

as in many liberal enclaves, the prevailing ethos in mt. lebanon now puts great emphasis on “inclusivity.” but as the case made clear, their inclusivity is meant only for politically acceptable minority groups. christians now are perhaps in the minority in our community. if you espouse a christian worldview, as did the three courageous moms who sued the school district, that is unacceptably intolerant.

in this regard, mt. lebanon has changed radically in the time we’ve lived there. it’s not quite berkeley (california) yet, but it has moved inexorably in that direction. while the lebo electorate was mostly republican when we moved here, the school board hasn’t had a republican elected to it in more than a decade.

and despite the rhetoric of “tolerance” expressed on yard signs and at cocktail parties, in the higher social strata, the only acceptable tolerance is that of the liberal persuasion. on the school board at least, if you cling to your bible, you are considered deplorable and decidedly persona non grata.

this transition of america — from true tolerance to a widespread embrace of cancel culture, in both urban and suburban settings, even in an outwardly friendly place like mt. lebanon that supposedly espouses tolerance — has been well documented by academics on the fringes of the academy, where the transition is most radical.

theologian carl trueman, of grove city college, has written persuasively on the role “expressive individualism” plays now in the social dynamic of towns like mt. lebanon. tolerance and inclusivity mean not just living quietly and peacefully as a trans person, but changing the pronoun usage of everyone else to conform to your expressive identity.

consider what happened in a virginia public school district. the school board recently agreed to pay $575,000, after years of litigation, to settle with peter vlaming, a high school french teacher whose employment was terminated in 2018 for refusing to use male pronouns for a transgender student. vlaming had tried to avoid pronouns altogether and used the student’s preferred name, but was fired after “accidentally” using a feminine pronoun. vlaming sued, and the viriginia supreme court ruled that his rights were violated.

“i was wrongfully fired from my teaching job because my religious beliefs put me on a collision course with school administrators who mandated that teachers ascribe to only one perspective on gender identity — their preferred view,” vlaming said. he was represented in his lawsuit by the alliance defending freedom.

social commentator aaron renn, author of life in the negative world, describes how christians in this dynamic are treated now in the “negative world.” “in this era,” renn writes, “society has an overall negative view of christianity. being known as a christian is a social negative, particularly in the higher domains of society. christian morality is expressly repudiated and now seen as a threat to the public good and new public moral order.”
federal court weighs in on trans instruction

on sept. 30, joy flowers conti, the senior federal judge in the western pennsylvania district court who oversaw the lengthy school court case, issued her decision.

until the judge’s ruling, williams’ own personal and subjective standard of gender fluidity and identity was the only acceptable pedagogy on transgender instruction in the mt. lebanon school district. when parents objected, administrators treated the parents as religious fanatics, and backed the teacher’s conduct without question or inquiry. the three moms then filed a federal lawsuit, claiming their constitutional rights were violated.

it was a david vs. goliath legal contest which ended, incredibly, in ignominious and embarrassing defeat for the school district. by issuing a summary judgment, judge conti said there was no need for a trial because there was nothing for a jury to decide.

as a matter of law, the judge writes in her opinion that the district and its attorneys didn’t understand the law as applied and interpreted in the u.s. court of appeals for the third circuit (based in philadelphia, which includes western pennsylvania).

a lawsuit that got scant local attention ended abruptly (local news outlets ignored it almost entirely, but the pittsburgh post-gazette recently covered the story.) ironically, a case the school district dealt with dismissively — it twice submitted petitions to the judge to have the complaint thrown out — turned out to be a huge win for parental, religious, and constitutional rights in public schools. (read more: what we’re learning from pushing back against the trans crowd)

summary judgment was entered in favor of all three plaintiffs and against the teacher, three administrators, and the district itself. there were no financial penalties asked for or assessed, but the district will likely be held liable for all of the plaintiffs’ attorney fees and costs.

as part of her ruling, judge conti issued a meticulous 94-page opinion that is must reading for anyone concerned with the drift towards radical activism that now pervades many public schools. within the 94 pages are the cultural signposts of our modern times.

on page 2, judge conti dismisses the “kindness, tolerance, and respect” argument so prevalent among transgender activists.

“there is no evidence in this [court] record of bullying, unkindness, or disrespect toward transgender students in the elementary school attended by the children of plaintiffs,” judge conti writes. “this case involves different beliefs about gender identity.”

one of the parents who objected to williams’ instruction was roman catholic. a second was mormon and the third religiously unaffiliated but morally motivated. of the three moms, only one still lives in the district. according to her attorney, she continues to be ostracized and cancelled by some in the community.

“the parents disagree that gender is a subjective, individual choice. they assert that gender is objective, immutable and determined by god and biology,” judge conti writes.

on page 19 of her opinion, judge conti relates a telling exchange which presaged the controversy.

on oct. 1, 2021, six months before the events occurred which triggered the lawsuit, a mt. lebanon parent (“not a party to this case”) wondered how jefferson elementary school might memorialize lbgtq month after reading about it in the school newsletter. the parent asked in an email to the school principal: “i was wondering if/how this is acknowledged in the first grade because i am not comfortable with my daughter learning about gender identity at this age.”

brett bielewicz, the school principal, replied: “there is no formal introduction or lessons surrounding it at [jefferson elementary school], especially in 1st grade. it’s just merely an acknowledgment of inclusivity and awareness to our jes community.”

nothing formal, but informally yes, as parents in the school would soon discover.

the events that triggered the lawsuit began on march 30, 2022, when megan williams, a former student in the district who teaches first grade at jefferson elementary school, sent a text to two fellow teachers which read: “tomorrow is international trans day of visibility. i’d like to read something.”

she was acting on impulse born of personal circumstance. williams’ child (a biological boy who was the same age as the first graders in her class) changed to using female pronouns the same week that williams read two transgender books to her first-grade class on “international trans day.”

on that day, the books were read and discussed. if it had stopped there, williams may have gotten away unscathed.

but after telling students that she’d like to bring her child to school in a month for take your child to work day (which teachers were not permitted to do), williams told students that her boy was now a girl, and she’d be wearing a dress to school. she then told the first graders “when children are born, parents make a guess whether they’re a boy or a girl. sometimes parents are wrong.”

one confused child raised his hand and said: “but i’m a boy. i don’t want to be a girl.” the aide in the class testified that the student was “upset.” williams responded, “yes you are. talk with your parents about that.”

in more than two years of litigation, the district (whose board president is himself an attorney) steadfastly maintained in repeated court filings that the parents not only had no case; they had no rights as parents to opt their first graders out of transgender instruction.

that argument — that “teacher prerogative” in the district trumped any and all parental rights — was specious, legal observers say. judge conti was equally skeptical.

she writes:

    throughout this litigation, [the district and its administrators] have taken the position that in a public school, parents have no constitutional right to notice or to opt their children out of any kind of instruction, regardless of the content of that instruction, the age of the children, or whether the instruction is part of the published school curriculum.…that is simply not the law within the third circuit.

she continues:

    refusing to provide opt outs for parents who assert religious and fundamental parental rights objections to transgender instruction to young children, while providing notice and opt out rights for other sensitive secular and religious topics, constitutes disparate treatment and violates the equal protection clause.

though few local citizens seemingly know of the case (due to the news coverage blackout), what made it such a lightning rod is that first graders were involved.

“who decides how to determine a young child’s gender identity goes to the heart of parental decision-making authority on a matter of greatest importance,” judge conti writes.

she further observes: “concerns about undercutting parental authority are heightened when the children are in first grade and the person trying to influence them is their teacher.”

and court testimony clearly demonstrated that teacher williams was not the least bit repentant. she believed “i’m in the right here!” and “that she was free to instruct the young, captive students in her class in accordance with her beliefs without giving parents prior notice or an opportunity to opt their children out of that instruction,” judge conti writes.

in any other context, this would be called indoctrination. but because it occurred in a mt. lebanon public elementary school, and was a type of indoctrination the school board endorsed, it is considered exhibiting “tolerance” and “respect.” that’s how the pittsburgh post-gazette framed it in this column (in fairness to the pg, they did publish my rebuttal).

of note, judge conti drew a sharp contrast with how principal bielewicz dealt with the parents’ complaint compared to another situation that arose at the school.

in the fall of 2022, after the lawsuit had been filed over the first-grade transgender instruction, a german teacher in the same school was doing some introductory instruction to a fifth-grade class about family-related words in german. in response to one student’s question, the teacher was alleged to have told the class, “i understand biology, and there’s always one mother and there’s always one father.”

after discussing this incident with assistant superintendent marybeth irvin, bielewicz, the school’s principal, interviewed every student in the class to assess the damage that had been done to the students.

by contrast, williams’ earlier violation, the judge noted in her opinion, was not investigated by either bielewicz or the district.

the judge writes: “bielewicz characterized the parents’ position as merely objecting to williams’ reading books.… the adult aides in williams’ classroom were not interviewed or consulted at all.… the administrators made public statements in support of williams.”

this pattern of discrimination on transgender topics explains why the judge ruled as she did.

while parents were not provided any advance notice or the ability to opt their children out from williams’ outburst on march 31, teachers within the district had on prior occasions provided advance notice and opt outs to students participating in routine activities, including: the scripps spelling bee; dissecting animals in biology; viewing video clips from a television series involving a gay character; and an assembly featuring a therapy dog.
will anything change?

returning to the chronology of events: when one of the plaintiff parents (carmilla tatel) met with school principal bielewicz on april 5, 2022 to raise concerns about williams’ conduct, he could not guarantee that williams wouldn’t teach the transgender content again.

according to the court record, bielewicz had sent an email to williams the day before which read: “you got tons of support from top down — trust me!”

he was right. incredibly, everyone in the chain of command — assistant superintendent irvin, superintendent steinhauer, and school board president jacob wyland — expressed public affirmation for williams and her actions.

no one was disciplined then, nor even now (one shortcoming of the ruling, in my view). williams and bielewicz still work at jefferson. steinhauer and irvin are retired, while wyland still heads the school board.

until recently, bielewicz’s public message as jefferson’s principal read as follows: “i thank you in advance for allowing me the opportunity to ‘be the change we wish to see in our world!’”

as part of the judge’s ruling, change will finally be enforced on him and others in the district. after more than two years of litigation, mt. lebanon schools have been ordered to give parents advance notice and opt out of transgender instruction. the total cost of this fiasco to community taxpayers has not been revealed.

“we are pleased that judge conti did a detailed examination of the facts and the law, and confirmed what we have said from the start: parental rights and beliefs matter in public education and cannot be disregarded or ignored. we are hopeful the district now understands that and will act accordingly,” says the victorious pittsburgh attorney david berardinelli, who very ably represented the plaintiffs.

will the mt. lebanon school district act accordingly in the future? the people who run it haven’t done anything sensible or truly tolerant since the start of this sad affair, so i have my doubts.

a decision on whether the district will appeal the decision is expected on oct. 21, when the school board meets. although an appeal might seem ill-advised under the circumstances, modern standards of “tolerance” dictate that it may.","['mt', 'lebanon', 'pa', 'leafy', 'suburb', 'south', 'pittsburgh', 'know', 'quality', 'life', 'fine', 'public', 'school', 'accord', 'educator', 'sit', 'blue',
