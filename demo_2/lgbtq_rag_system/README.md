# Main Application Logic

This directory contains the main logic for the LGBTQ.AI+ system, including:

- Vertex AI inference calls via `model/llama_runner.py`
- Embedding generation and similarity scoring
- Model classification code
- Support files for integrating with the frontend or triggering jobs

This is the active directory where model inference and LLM calls happen.
