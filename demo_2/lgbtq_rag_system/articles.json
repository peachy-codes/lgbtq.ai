This decision overturns a previous ruling by U.S. District Judge Robert Hinkle, who had blocked the law, citing it as discriminatory against transgender individuals. The appellate court's majority opinion stated that the legislature likely did not act with discriminatory intent. However, the dissenting judge emphasized the potential harm to transgender individuals denied care. The law, known as SB 254, prohibits puberty blockers and hormonal treatments for minors and mandates that transgender adults can only receive treatment from a doctor, not from nurse practitioners or other qualified providers. The legal battle continues as the case may eventually reach the U.S. Supreme Court, which is already reviewing a similar law from Tennessee.",
