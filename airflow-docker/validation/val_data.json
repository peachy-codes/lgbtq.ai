    "full_text": "Transgender women in Britain fear ruling could place toilets, sports and hospitals off limits Transgender women will be excluded from women\u2019s toilets, hospital wards and sports teams after a U.K. Supreme Court ruling, the head of the Equality and Human Rights Commission said Thursday, as trans groups digested a judgment that could have a broad and detrimental impact on daily life.\n\nWhile Britain\u2019s highest court said there was no clear winner in its ruling defining a woman for anti-discrimination purposes as someone born biologically female, noting that transgender people remain protected from discrimination, trans groups said the decision would undermine their rights.\n\nEquality Commission Chairwoman Kishwer Falkner said the \u201cenormously consequential\u201d ruling brought clarity and would prompt her organization to update public codes by summer to comply.\n\n\u201cSingle-sex services like changing rooms must be based on biological sex,\u201d she told the BBC. \u201cIf a male person is allowed to use a women-only service or facility, it isn\u2019t any longer single-sex, then it becomes a mixed-sex space.\u201d\n\n\nCourt challenge arose from public board quota\nThe ruling Wednesday came in a case that had nothing to do with those spaces, but stemmed from a 2018 law passed by the Scottish Parliament that required at least 50% women on boards of Scottish public bodies. Transgender women with gender recognition certificates were to be included in meeting the quota.\n\nBut the court said that using a certificate to interpret someone\u2019s sex would clash with definitions of man and woman and, therefore, the anti-discrimination provisions of the 2010 Equality Act could \u201conly be interpreted as referring to biological sex.\u201d\n\nOut of some 66 million people in England, Scotland and Wales, about 116,000 identified as trans in the latest census count. About 8,500 gender recognition certificates have been issued.\n\nThe feminist group that brought the court case said the outcome provided common sense, protected same-sex spaces for women and brought clarity to the thorny issue. But trans groups said it had caused fear and uncertainty. Trans support services overwhelmed\nTrans activist jane fae, a director of the group TransActual, said she worried the ruling would mean \u201ctotal exclusion and segregation\u201d of trans women.\n\n\u201cNo trans women in women\u2019s changing rooms, no trans women in women\u2019s loos, no trans women in women\u2019s sports,\u201d fae said.\n\n\u201cThe number of people I have come across on social platforms, on forums, etc., saying \u2018How do I go on? I am in tears, I\u2019m in pieces. I am shattered. I am broken,\u2019\u201d fae said. \u201cThat seems to be pretty much a unanimous reaction.\u201d\n\nGendered Intelligence, a charity dedicated to understanding gender diversity and improving trans lives, said its support services had been overwhelmed with calls from people worried about whether they\u2019d be able to return to their soccer team next week, receive medical care or get support for domestic violence.\n\n\u201cThe fear and the despair is very, very real,\u201d said spokesperson Cleo Madeleine. \u201cAnd in all of this talk of whether or not people are going to be excluded, whether or not people are going to be banned, there\u2019s been no real sense of what we\u2019re supposed to do if we are.\u201d\n\nFalkner noted that there was no law requiring single-sex spaces and she encouraged trans groups to advocate for neutral spaces such as unisex toilets or changing rooms. Divisive issue in the culture wars\nGender identity has not been as divisive in the U.K. as the U.S., where it has created political firestorms in some states, but the topic factors into Britain\u2019s own culture wars.\n\nNewspapers have reported on a group of female nurses who sued their employer after they had to share a changing room with a male colleague who identifies as female, and about a nurse who was suspended for calling a transgender pedophile \u201cmister.\u201d\n\nChris Evans, editor of The Telegraph, a politically conservative London newspaper, said in its morning newsletter Thursday that the court had \u201cdeclared that transgender women are not legally women,\u201d and said it was looking into what the ruling means for \u201cpublic bodies who have sacrificed women\u2019s rights on the altar of inclusivity.\u201d\n\nBritish Transport Police announced it was reviewing its policies in light of the ruling and would temporarily change the way it conducts strip searches of transgender people in custody by assigning an officer of the same biological birth sex. Uncertainty over what comes next for trans people\nFalkner said her group would continue to defend the rights of trans people.\n\n\u201cThey have rights, and their rights must be respected,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a victory for an increase in unpleasant actions against trans people. We will not tolerate that.\u201d\n\nBut Madeleine said that Falkner had provided no sense of what the future holds for vulnerable people who may find themselves shut out of sports, counseling services and health care.\n\n\u201cMy concern is that if the equalities minister does push for transgender people to be shut out from these spaces, as they say, there\u2019s going to be nowhere else for them to go,\u201d Madeleine said. \u201cThe message we\u2019re getting, frankly, from the highest equalities office in the country is that they want to get rid of us, and they don\u2019t really care where we go.\u201d\n\n",

    "full_text": "State District Court of Appeals Blocks Ohio\u2019s Ban on Gender-Affirming Care for Trans Minors, in an Historic Win for Families and Bodily Autonomy Today, in an historic win for bodily autonomy and LGBTQ+ Ohioans, a three judge panel on the Tenth District Court of Appeals overturned House Bill 68, Ohio\u2019s law banning gender-affirming medical care for trans youth, and prohibiting trans women and girls from participating in sports.\n\nThe case, Moe v. Yost, was originally filed on March 26 by the American Civil Liberties Union, the ACLU of Ohio, and the global law firm Goodwin on behalf of two families whose transgender adolescents would be negatively impacted by HB 68. On August 6, following a five-day trial in July, the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 challenge, and allowed the ban to take effect. Today, transgender youth in Ohio will once again be able to access lifesaving healthcare.\n\nThe following is reaction to the ruling:\n\nFreda Levenson, Legal Director at the ACLU of Ohio:\n\n\u201cToday, we celebrate this win not only for our brave plaintiffs, but for all LGBTQ+ Ohioans and their families. This win restores the right of trans youth in Ohio to choose vitally important health care, with the support of their families and physicians. We are gratified by the Court\u2019s decision, which soundly rejects this interference of politicians with Ohioans\u2019 bodily autonomy. Although this litigation will likely not end here, we remain fervently committed to preventing this egregious bill from ever again taking effect. The path towards protecting the rights and civil liberties of trans Ohioans goes on, and we will continue to hold the torch.\u201d\n\nHarper Seldin, Senior Staff Attorney, American Civil Liberties Union:\n\u201cThis is a critical victory for transgender youth and their families across Ohio. The state\u2019s ban is discriminatory, baseless, and a danger to the well-being of the same Ohioan youth lawmakers claim to want to protect. It\u2019s also part of a sweeping effort to drive trans people out of public life altogether by controlling our health care, our families, and our lives. We\u2019re thankful the court upheld their rights under the state constitution.\u201d\n\nMiranda Hooker, Complex Litigation & Dispute Resolution Partner, Goodwin:\n\n\"We applaud the families who courageously shared their personal experiences to oppose House Bill 68. This victory underscores the critical need to safeguard bodily autonomy and access to essential healthcare. The decision marks an important milestone in advancing equality and personal freedom for all Ohioans and we will continue to fight against the unconstitutional Bill moving forward.\"\n",

She also accused the trans ban\u2019s proponents of creating a problem where there is none.\n\n\u201cRedlands should not and cannot stand for this form of discrimination,\u201d she said.\n\nRedlands joins its fellow California school district, Chino Valley, in voting to ban trans athletes.\n\n\u201cIt is not controversial, it is common sense,\u201d said Chino Valley Shaw school board President Sonja Shaw, who traveled to Redlands for the vote. \u201cWe are here to make common sense common again.\u201d\n\nThe vote comes on the heels of a recent poll of Californians, which shows a strong majority of that state\u2019s likely voters disagree with allowing transgender athletes to compete in girls\u2019 sports.\n\n\u201cA new poll found that 65 percent of California likely voters think transgender-identifying athletes should be required to play on teams that match their sex rather than their claimed \u2018gender identity,\u201d Breitbart\u2019s Katherine Hamilton reported. \u201cThe survey, which was conducted by the nonpartisan Public Policy Institute of California, found that nearly half of Democrats in the state agree.\u201d",

    "full_text": "Transgender Activists Say Your Kids Have A \u2018Right\u2019 To Carve Up Their Bodies If you pay attention to the transgender debate, it\u2019s been obvious for a while now that the trans movement is interested in children. The specter of state lawmakers or even parents hindering or discouraging children from \u201ctransitioning\u201d seems to haunt trans activists, who view recent political efforts to ban so-called \u201cgender-affirming care\u201d in some states as the worst sort of tyranny. Children, in their view, have a right to transition, and any obstacle placed in their way, even by parents, is a gross injustice crying out for redress.\n\nUp until recently, this argument was simmering just below the surface of the transgender discourse in America. It was the subtext first of the bathroom debate, then of the debate over girls\u2019 sports, then of the debate over the role teachers and public schools are playing in transing kids socially without informing parents, and finally of state laws restricting transgender surgeries, puberty blockers, and other treatments for minors. In each case, the unstated argument was that minors who believe they are trans should be allowed to transition, socially and medically, and no one, not even their parents, should have the right to stop them.\n\nNow that argument is out in the open \u2014 declared in bold black letters against a blood-red field on the latest cover of New York Magazine: \u201cFreedom of Sex, the moral case for letting trans kids change their bodies.\u201d\n\nThe author of the piece is a man named Andrea Long Chu, the magazine\u2019s Pulitzer Prize-winning literary critic and a self-identified lesbian \u201ctrans woman,\u201d who by his own admission was persuaded of this particular gender identity after becoming addicted to pornography \u2014 specifically to something called \u201csissy porn,\u201d which encourages men to \u201cfeminize\u201d and sexually humiliate themselves.\n\nChu has probably done more than anyone else in recent years to mainstream transgenderism, mostly through his 2019 book, Females, which chronicles his dark obsession with sissy porn. I won\u2019t quote it here, but suffice it to say, it makes for unpleasant reading (even in small excerpts). To give you a sense of this person, he was aptly described by Peachy Keenan on Twitter this week as \u201ca radical trans activist who is an obese man who now calls himself a lesbian and has a neovagina.\u201d\n\nWhat better spokesman, then, for the idea that children should be allowed to undergo an array of surgical procedures and drug therapies, even against their parents\u2019 wishes or without their knowledge. Chu\u2019s argument relies on holding up bizarre anecdotes and medical anomalies as normative and quoting radical gender theorists from the 1970s. The essay itself is weighed down with the intentionally opaque academic jargon of gender studies, which makes reading it an unhappy chore. So I\u2019ll save you the trouble: His main point is that we need to jettison the idea that youth transgenderism is something that can be diagnosed by medical experts, that it requires one to meet any sort of criteria, and that it even has a cause. It is simply a fact of modern life that we must all accept.\n\n\u201cWe will never be able to defend the rights of transgender kids until we understand them purely on their own terms: as full members of society who would like to change their sex,\u201d he writes. \u201cWe must be prepared to defend the idea that, in principle, everyone should have access to sex-changing medical care, regardless of age, gender identity, social environment, or psychiatric history.\u201d\n\nThis is a radical argument that carries an equally radical agenda. Among other things, it means there is no point to the political debates now raging over girls\u2019 sports, the legality of \u201cgender-affirming care\u201d for youth, and pretty much everything else related to the transgender movement. The \u201canti-trans bloc,\u201d writes Chu, has \u201ctargeted children because Americans tend to imagine children both as a font of pure, unadulterated humanity and as ignorant dependents incapable of rational thought or political agency.\u201d\n\nNever mind that children by definition are rightly incapable of political agency; they are in the charge of their parents, who exercise political agency on their behalf. Nor are they entirely capable of rational thought, which is why we don\u2019t allow them to vote or drink alcohol or get tattoos.\n\nBut such realities are brushed aside by Chu, who insists that \u201cthe freedom to bring sex and gender into whatever relation one chooses is a basic human right,\u201d and that we cannot deny this right to children.\n\nInterestingly, Chu\u2019s primary target here is liberals, not conservatives \u2014 readers of The New York Times and The Atlantic. He calls them \u201ctrans-agnostic reactionary liberal,\u201d or TARLs, whose primary concern is the illiberality of the trans movement itself and its habit of \u201ctrafficking in censorship, intimidation, and quasi-religious fanaticism. On trans people themselves, the TARL claims to take no position other than to voice his general empathy for anyone suffering from psychological distress or civil-rights violations.\u201d\n\nThey err, he says, in supposing that there is any psychological distress behind a person\u2019s desire to transition, or that transitioning is something we should tolerate for those who really need it but certainly not encourage. Reconceiving of transgenderism as a basic human right means getting away from that kind of thinking and clearing the public square of these debates entirely.\n\nIn practice, he says, this means a kind of radical laissez-fair policy when it comes to things like castration and sterilization and the entire smorgasbord of \u201ctreatments\u201d now on offer for those who identify as transgender. \u201cLet anyone change their sex,\u201d says Chu. \u201cLet anyone change their gender. Let anyone change their sex again. Let trans girls play sports, regardless of their sex status. If they excel, this means only that some girls are better at sports than others.\u201d\n\nThere is something deeply wrong with the reasoning here, as if reality itself can offer no resistance to the ideology of self-creation that Chu would enshrine in our polity. In the concluding paragraphs, he makes statements like, \u201c[I]f children are too young to consent to puberty blockers, then they are definitely too young to consent to puberty, which is a drastic biological upheaval in its own right.\u201d\n\nThe conflation of powerful drugs like puberty blockers with the natural process of puberty is not just a disfigurement of reason, it is an assault on the idea that there is a natural order at all. It is a claim of human will and desire over and against reality itself, an assault on the givenness of the created order. In secular terms, one might call it delusional or fantastic. In Christian terms, one should rightly call it Satanic. \n\nTrans kids, writes Chu, \u201care busy taking charge of their own creation\u201d \u2014 that is, themselves. The idea that we can \u201ccreate\u201d ourselves is popular among trans activists, including AI-addled transhumanists. But it\u2019s also popular among ordinary liberals and unreligious, uncatechized modern people who generally like the idea that we all make ourselves into what we are.\n\nTherein lies the strategy behind Chu\u2019s approach. He is appealing to a bias embedded in the liberal worldview, an assumption that we are not limited by a created order, much less a Creator. It\u2019s a clever ploy because, at the end of the day, liberals have no answer to this argument. They must accept its premise \u2014 that every person can create his own truth, and indeed has a right to his own truth \u2014 or fall back on some notion of natural law, which necessarily implies a created natural order and all that it entails.\n\nChu and the trans movement for which he speaks are betting that liberals will not be able to resist what amounts to an extension of liberals\u2019 own logic. They are betting, smartly, that most of them lack the theological vocabulary to apprehend the old lie from the Garden, now disguised in the modern verbiage of rights and identities: You will not surely die, you will become like God.",

    "full_text": "Federal judge blocks Trump's transgender military executive order A federal judge appointed by former President Joe Biden has blocked President Donald Trump's executive order banning transgender people from serving in the U.S. military. \n\nU.S. District Judge Ana Reyes in Washington, D.C., issued a preliminary injunction barring the Pentagon from enforcing Trump's order, which asserted \"expressing a false \u2018gender identity\u2019 divergent from an individual\u2019s sex cannot satisfy the rigorous standards necessary for military service.\" The order, issued Jan. 27, instructed the Department of Defense (DOD) to update its medical standards for military service and pronoun policies, stating that \"beyond the hormonal and surgical medical interventions involved, adoption of a gender identity inconsistent with an individual\u2019s sex conflicts with a soldier\u2019s commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one's personal life.\" \n\nReyes said that the executive order likely poses constitutional rights violations. \n\n\"The court knows that this opinion will lead to heated public debate and appeals. In a healthy democracy, both are positive outcomes,\" Reyes wrote, delaying her order until Friday morning to allow time for the Trump administration to appeal. \"We should all agree, however, that every person who has answered the call to serve deserves our gratitude and respect.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump issued an executive order banning transgender troops. (Win McNamee/Getty Images)\n\nTransgender individuals were considered unfit for U.S. military service until the DOD changed its policy during former President Barack Obama's second term. \n\nIn her 79-page ruling, Reyes in part cites Lin-Manuel Miranda's musical \"Hamilton\" to justify blocking the ban on transgender troops. \n\n\"Women were \u2018included in the sequel\u2019 when passage of the Nineteenth Amendment granted them the right to vote in 1920,\" Reyes wrote in the footnotes, adding, \"That right is one of the many that thousands of transgender persons serve to protect.\"\n\nReyes said plaintiffs \"face a violation of their constitutional rights, which constitutes irreparable harm.\" \n\n\"Indeed, the cruel irony is that thousands of transgender servicemembers have sacrificed \u2013 some risking their lives \u2013 to ensure for others the very equal protection rights the Military Ban seeks to deny them,\" the judge wrote, adding that the defendants, on the other hand, \"have not shown they will be burdened by continuing the status quo pending this litigation, and avoiding constitutional violations is always in the public interest.\" \n\nWhite House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller condemned Reyes' ruling on X, writing, \"District court judges have now decided they are in command of the Armed Forces\u2026is there no end to this madness?\" \n\nReyes was the second judge of the day to rule against the Trump administration. Trump called for impeaching a third judge who temporarily blocked deportation flights, drawing a rare rebuke from Chief Justice John Roberts.\nTransgender veteran protests against Trump\n\nA transgender person speaks as U.S. military veterans and supporters protest against the Trump administration outside the Indiana Statehouse in Indianapolis. (Jeremy Hogan/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)\n\n\"Unelected rogue judges are trying to steal years of time from a 4 year term. It\u2019s the most egregious theft one can imagine: robbing the vote and voice of the American People,\" Miller wrote in another X post. \n\nIn response to Trump's executive order, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth issued a policy on Feb. 26 that presumptively disqualifies people with gender dysphoria from military service. The policy says, \"a current diagnosis or history of, or exhibit symptoms consistent with, gender dysphoria are incompatible with the high mental and physical standards necessary for military service.\"\n\nPlaintiffs\u2019 attorneys contend Trump\u2019s order violates transgender people\u2019s rights to equal protection under the Fifth Amendment.\n\nGovernment lawyers argue that military officials have broad discretion to decide how to assign and deploy service members without judicial interference.\nPlaintiffs in lawsuit against Trump's transgender troops ban outside federal courthouse\n\nSenior Director of Queer and Transgender Rights Jennifer Levi speaks outside a Washington, D.C., federal courthouse on Feb. 18, 2025. A group of transgender service members and prospective enlistees requested a preliminary injunction against President Donald Trump's ban on transgender troops. (JIM WATSON/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nReyes said she did not take lightly her decision to issue an injunction blocking Trump\u2019s order, noting that \"Judicial overreach is no less pernicious than executive overreach.\" However, she said, it was also the responsibility of each branch of government to provide checks and balances for the others, and the court \"therefore must act to uphold the equal protection rights that the military defends every day.\"\n\nThousands of transgender people serve in the military, but they represent less than 1% of the total number of active-duty service members, according to The Associated Press. \n\nIn 2016, a DOD policy permitted transgender people to serve openly in the military. During Trump\u2019s first term, he issued a directive to ban transgender service members. The Supreme Court allowed the ban to take effect. \n\nBiden, a Democrat who served as Obama's vice president, scrapped it when he took office.",

    "full_text": "Tennessee Town Faces Down Liberal Protests, Votes To Remove Books Promoting Transgenderism To Kids MURFREESBORO, Tenn. \u2014 A Tennessee library board voted Monday evening to remove all books promoting transgenderism to children from its system, facing down protesters who called them \u201cNazis\u201d for taking the stand. \n\nThe Rutherford County Library board voted 5-3 in favor of a resolution to take books encouraging children to adopt radical gender ideology off their shelves. The vote came after a tense 2-hour meeting attended by over 100 community members who showed up at the Historic Rutherford County Courthouse in Murfreesboro, about 34 miles from Nashville, to hear debate on the resolution.\n\nThe resolution directed the library to \u201cremove material that promotes, encourages, advocates for or normalizes transgenderism or \u2018gender confusion\u2019 in minors.\u201d\n\nAfter the vote was taken, a group of supporters of the resolution, who showed up wearing white shirts, erupted with cheers and clapping. Opponents, who heckled the board throughout the meeting, shouted things like \u201cNazis!\u201d at the library board. During debate on the resolution, audience members would break out in cheers after a board member spoke in favor of their position.\n\nCody York, who introduced the measure, said that he did so because the board had an obligation to protect children.\n\n\u201cThe library board is expending money to keep books on the shelf. By just keeping a book we are making a decision to expend funds, taxpayer dollars, to keep those books there,\u201d York said. \u201cBooks that promote transgender ideology are harmful to children.\u201d\n\nYork referenced detransitioners across the country who have sued their doctors for performing transgender medical procedures on them.\n\n\u201cThe state and federal government have determined that these are harmful practices,\u201d York said, pointing to President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order that the federal government would not promote transgender procedures on kids. \u201cThe fact that some children in our community struggle with gender confusion means that we should be equipping them to successfully deal with the dangers of, and root cause of, that danger.\u201d\n\nBefore the votes, 10 community members were given 3 minutes each to speak.\n\n\u201cIf we cause children to go down this road, they can make decisions they will regret for the rest of their lives. When we expose them to things that they don\u2019t have a level to understand, it\u2019s really sexualizing them,\u201d a woman named Michelle said, urging the board to take away books promoting transgender ideology. \u201cChildren, they don\u2019t have a capacity for this. If we say we love them, if we say that \u2018you are loved,\u2019 \u2018we loved you,\u2019 we should want to tell that person the truth. Love is truth.\u201d\n\nUnder the new policy, staff at libraries across the county would have to flag books promoting transgender ideology to kids and turn them over to the board for evaluation.\n\nBoard members who voted in favor included York, Marzee Woodard, Dina Piazza, and Susan Quesenberry. Those who voted against included Benjamin Groce, Kory Wells, and Rollie Holden.\n\nPreviously, in the meeting the board voted to remove a book called \u201cMe & My Dysphoria Monster,\u201d a children\u2019s illustrated book that tells the story of a boy who believes that he is a girl who meets a \u201ctrans man\u201d who teaches him about gender dysphoria.\n\nThat vote was 5-2 along almost the same lines as the other vote, except with an abstention from Holden.\n\nTennessee state lawmakers have already moved to get sexually explicit books out of school libraries, and this new Rutherford County resolution would enact a similar policy at the county level for transgender ideology.",

If you or someone you know is having thoughts of suicide, please contact the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline at 988 or 1-800-273-TALK (8255).\n\nSo-called \"gender-affirming surgery\" could lead to potentially dangerous mental health effects, a new study has found.\n\nTransgender individuals face \"heightened psychological distress,\" including depression, anxiety and suicidal ideation, \"partly due to stigma and lack of gender affirmation,\" as stated in the study, which was published in The Journal of Sexual Medicine.\n\nResearchers from the University of Texas set out to determine the mental health impacts from transgender people who underwent \"gender-affirming surgery.\"\n\nThe study focused on 107,583 patients 18 and over with gender dysphoria, some who underwent surgery and others who did not.\nWoman hospital from back\n\n\"Gender-affirming surgery\" could lead to dangerous mental health effects, a new study has found. (iStock)\n\nThey determined rates of depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation and substance-use disorders were \"significantly higher\" among those who underwent surgery, assessed two years later.\n\nMales with surgery had depression rates of 25% compared to males without surgery (11.5%). Anxiety rates among that group were 12.8% compared to 2.6%.\n\n    Depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation and substance-use disorders were \"significantly higher\" among those who underwent surgery.\n\nThe same differences were seen among females, as those with surgery had 22.9% depression rates compared to 14.6% in the non-surgical group.\n\nFemales who underwent surgery also had anxiety rates of 10.5% compared to 7.1% without surgery.\nMale and female symbols drawn using chalk on a chalkboard\n\nThe study focused on 107,583 patients 18 and over with gender dysphoria, some who underwent surgery and others who did not. (iStock)\n\nSurgeries that aimed to \"feminize individuals\" showed \"particularly high\" rates of depression and substance abuse two years after the procedures, the study found.\n\n\"Findings suggest the necessity for gender-sensitive mental health support following gender-affirming surgery to address post-surgical psychological risks,\" the researchers wrote.\n\u2018Not a cure-all\u2019\n\nJonathan Alpert, a Manhattan-based psychotherapist and author, said the study findings highlight the \"often overlooked\" psychological risks that accompany gender-affirming surgery.\n\n\"While these surgeries can be critical in helping individuals align their physical appearance with their gender identity, they are not a cure-all for the mental health challenges many transgender individuals face,\" Alpert, who was not involved in the study, told Fox News Digital.\n\n\"These findings suggest that surgery alone doesn\u2019t eliminate the complex psychological burdens that stem from societal stigma and personal struggles with identity,\" he went on.\n\n\"In fact, taking a scalpel to treat a psychological disorder can sometimes lead to more issues, as the study results are elucidating.\"\nMan at doctor\n\n\"This isn\u2019t about politics and ideology \u2014 it\u2019s about health, longevity, and making sure people don\u2019t undergo drastic, life-altering procedures only to regret them.\" (iStock)\n\nFlorida neurosurgeon Dr. Brett Osborn, who also was not part of the study, agreed that \"surgery is no guarantee of happiness.\"\n\n\"We\u2019re often told that gender-affirming surgery is essential for alleviating gender dysphoria \u2014 but what happens when the euphoria fades?\" he said in an interview with Fox News Digital.\n\n\"The key question remains: Is the surgery itself causing distress, or are preexisting mental health issues driving people toward it? Correlation or causation? No one knows.\"\nPotential causes of gender dysphoria\n\nA 2022 study showed that around 1.4 million American adults identify as transgender and about 0.6% of all American adults experience gender dysphoria.\n\n\"The dramatic upward trend of gender dysphoria among young people in recent years should raise serious questions about the role of cultural and social influences,\" Alpert said.\n\n\"While increased awareness has made it easier for some children to express their struggles, we cannot ignore the possibility that social contagion, along with peer influence and social media, may be contributing to this surge.\"\nGender-affirming care hormones puberty blockers consent\n\nOne doctor also cautioned against sexual hormone therapy \u2014 \"we\u2019re talking about irreversible changes that demand lifelong management.\" (Adobe Stock )\n\nBoth experts caution against rushing into surgery or other irreversible decisions.\n\nTeens who are being treated for gender dysphoria should be \"properly supported and treated with compassion\" without being pressured into making \"life-altering\" medical decisions, Alpert advised.\n\n    \"You don\u2019t amputate a limb because of temporary pain, and you certainly don\u2019t permanently alter your body without exhausting every other option first.\"\n\nOsborn also stressed the need for comprehensive psychological evaluations, especially for those with preexisting mental health challenges. Mental health support, lifestyle modifications and counseling should all take precedence before surgery, not after, he said.\n\n\"You don\u2019t amputate a limb because of temporary pain, and you certainly don\u2019t permanently alter your body without exhausting every other option first,\" he said.\nTeen girl at therapist\n\nThe doctors stressed the need for comprehensive psychological evaluations, especially for those with preexisting mental health challenges.  (iStock)\n\nOsborn expressed the same cautions about hormone therapy \u2014 \"we\u2019re talking about irreversible changes that demand lifelong management.\"\n\n\"This isn\u2019t about politics and ideology \u2014 it\u2019s about health, longevity, and making sure people don\u2019t undergo drastic, life-altering procedures only to regret them,\" he said.\n\nFor more Health articles, visit www.foxnews.com/health\n\n\"That said, to a great degree, the burden is on us physicians who took an oath to first do no harm.\"\n\nMark Trammell, executive director of The Center for American Liberty, which provides legal representation to people who are de-transitioning after trans surgeries, provided the below statement to Fox News Digital.\n\n    \"Surgery alone doesn\u2019t eliminate the complex psychological burdens that stem from societal stigma and personal struggles with identity.\"\n\n\"The findings of this study should serve as a wake-up call. But for the young detransitioners we represent in lawsuits against gender clinics, these statistics are their lived reality,\" he said.\n\n\"Their so-called 'gender-affirming care' did not alleviate their distress \u2014 it created new mental health struggles and, for many, introduced suicidal thoughts for the first time. This is why we are fighting to hold those responsible accountable.\"\n\nFox News Digital reached out to the study researchers requesting comment.",

    "full_text": "The Trump Admin Has Already Decided That Trans Athletes in Maine Violate Title IX The Trump administration has already declared that the state of Maine violated federal law by allowing transgender and cisgender girls to play in the same sports leagues, following an \u201cinvestigation\u201d that lasted less than one week and reportedly did not include contacting state administrators.\n\nAdministration officials first announced on February 21 that they would investigate Maine\u2019s compliance with Title IX civil rights regulations, following a heated exchange between Trump and Maine Gov. Janet Mills at a National Governors Association gathering. At the event, Mills publicly refused to comply with Trump\u2019s executive order against trans youth in school sports, which threatens to withdraw federal funding from states that maintain inclusive policies.\n\nOnly four days later, in a document later obtained by ABC affiliate WMTW, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) notified Mills and Maine Attorney General Aaron Frey that the state Department of Education was found to have violated Title IX.\n\nThe document \u2014 signed by Anthony Archeval, acting director of the Office of Civil Rights (OCR) \u2014 claims that the Maine Department of Education currently \u201cviolates Title IX by denying female student athletes in the State of Maine an equal opportunity to participate in\u201d school athletics, because of the possible inclusion of trans girls.\n\nOffering \u201cadditional opportunity\u201d for people who \u201cassert a \u2018gender identity\u2019 different from their sex, constitutes discrimination on the basis of gender identity, against students who identify as their sex,\u201d the document continues. Archeval\u2019s letter also explicitly casts aside discussion of trans boys, asserting that cis boys \u201care not subject to heightened safety or competitive concerns\u201d in sports.\n\nAbsent from the document is any record of an official investigation, which would usually include interviewing witnesses and collecting evidence over the course of weeks or months. Instead, Archeval\u2019s letter referenced two news stories alleging that two trans girls have participated in high school sports in Maine. One of the stories \u2014 published on OutKick, a right-wing sports website known for negative coverage of trans athletes \u2014 focused on allegations that a trans girl placed third and fourth in competitive skiing events. The other was based on a Facebook post last month by Maine Republican Rep. Laurel Libby, in which Libby posted photos of a high schooler she claimed was trans and had recently won a track meet.\n\nThe identity of that student has not been publicly confirmed, though the named high school temporarily increased security in the days after Libby\u2019s post. Libby has since been censured by the state House of Representatives, but refused to apologize this week.\n\nDanna Hayes, a spokesperson for A.G. Frey\u2019s office, told the Portland Press Herald that \u201cthere is no pending litigation\u201d against the state regarding Title IX. Hayes also told the Bangor Daily News that \u201c[n]o action has been taken yet\u201d by the federal government in regards to stripping funding from the state Department of Education, as Trump threatened. Mills\u2019 office declined to comment to reporters this week, directing press to the governor\u2019s previous statement, in which she said \u201cthe outcome of this politically directed investigation is all but predetermined.\u201d\n\nSince taking office in January, Trump has sought to eliminate civil rights for trans people in numerous areas, particularly the rights of trans minors to participate in school sports and receive gender-affirming medical care. In his address to Congress earlier this week, Trump repeatedly denigrated and misgendered trans people of all ages, vowing that \u201cwokeness is dead\u201d in the U.S. under his administration.",

    "full_text": "Most Justices Skeptical of Interfering With Tennessee\u2019s Ban on \u2018Gender-Affirming Care\u2019 for Minors The U.S. Supreme Court had only one case slated for oral argument Wednesday morning, but it was a doozy.\n\nWith protesters chanting outside, the court heard arguments for two-and-a-half hours from attorneys for the state of Tennessee, the Department of Justice, and the ACLU in a challenge to the constitutionality of Tennessee\u2019s ban on \u201cgender-affirming\u201d care for minors.\n\nIn U.S. v. Skrmetti, the Biden Justice Department and the ACLU argued that the state law violates the equal protection clause of the Constitution\u2019s 14th Amendment because it discriminates based on sex. To the contrary, the state of Tennessee and its attorney general, Jonathan Skrmetti, say the law restricts conduct based only on age (for those children under the age of 18) and how certain drugs are used (for so-called gender-affirming care). Legal challenges to these types of laws are typically brought by parents who seek drugs, such as puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones, and surgical intervention for their children who profess to identify with the opposite sex. They argue that laws like Tennessee\u2019s violate two parts of the 14th Amendment\u2014the due process clause, by depriving parents of the right to make medical decisions for their children, and the equal protection clause, by discriminating against their children based on sex.\n\nPresident Joe Biden\u2019s administration, rather than parents, brought this challenge, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit rejected both arguments. Last year, the 8th Circuit struck down a similar Arkansas law, but only on equal protection grounds.\nThe Supreme Court, therefore, is addressing only that argument, because that is the one on which the 6th and 8th circuits disagreed. During the argument, however, Justice Amy Coney Barrett clarified that upholding the Tennessee statute on equal protection grounds would not prevent parents from pursuing their claim that such laws violate the due process clause.\n\n\u2018Main Issue on the Table\u2019\nThe heart of the challengers\u2019 case is that the Tennessee statute treats people differently based on sex. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson agreed that this is the \u201cmain issue on the table.\u201d The kind of classification of a law is important to determining the appropriate standard of review, which in turn determines how easy or difficult it is to defend that law against a challenge under the equal protection clause.\n\nMost laws that make distinctions as to when they will or will not apply do not do so on the basis of a \u201csuspect class.\u201d Such laws are subject to rational basis review and are constitutional if they are a \u201crational\u201d way of addressing a \u201clegitimate\u201d legislative purpose\u2014a relatively easy standard to meet.\n\nIf a law makes distinctions by classifying people based on a \u201csex,\u201d it is subject to heightened or \u201cintermediate scrutiny\u201d review. Such laws will be upheld only if they are \u201csubstantially related\u201d to achieving an \u201cimportant\u201d government purpose.\n\nAs Tennessee persuasively argues, rather than classifying based on sex, the law classifies on based on purpose. In other words, it distinguishes based on minors seeking drugs for gender transition and minors seeking drugs for any other medical purposes. The Supreme Court has never recognized restrictions on the use of drugs for a particular medical purpose to demand heightened scrutiny review, so rational-basis review applies.\n\nThat standard, the state of Tennessee easily satisfies, and the 6th Circuit agreed. \u2018A Sex-Based Classification\u2019?\nBut the challengers want to label the law a sex-based classification to make it harder for Tennessee to defend.\n\nArguing for the Biden administration, U.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar asked the court simply to put the Tennessee statute in that category and send the case back to the lower courts to apply the \u201cintermediate scrutiny\u201d review test. But Justice Brett Kavanaugh observed that, if it did, the case would soon be right back in the Supreme Court\u2019s lap.\n\nPrelogar insisted that the Tennessee statute is obviously based on sex, but her argument is inconsistent with the text of the statute itself. She argued that the law would allow a boy to obtain puberty-blockers to delay experiencing a normal male puberty, but a girl could not. But the statute only says that a minor may not obtain such drugs for the purposes of identifying with a different sex\u2014and that prohibition applies equally to both boys and to girls.\n\nDespite Prelogar\u2019s insistence, the law only restricts access to the drugs based on age and on the medical use of the drugs.\n\nKavanaugh, Chief Justice John Roberts, and Justice Samuel Alito expressed hesitancy about involving themselves in issues that are better left to state legislatures to decide.\n\n\u2018Leave the Issue to the Legislatures\u2019?\nRoberts argued that the court was \u201cnot [in] the best situation to make determinations about medical considerations. Doesn\u2019t that make the case for us to leave the issue to the legislatures?\u201d He also alluded to the court\u2019s landmark ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization in June 2022, which overturned Roe v. Wade, saying that the current case was really about \u201cconstitutional allocations of authority.\u201d In an almost verbatim recitation from the Dobbs majority opinion, he continued: \u201cPerhaps we should leave this issue to the people and their elected representatives.\u201d\n\nRoberts and Kavanaugh also stressed the shaky scientific footing of gender \u201cmedicine,\u201d and cited various European reports, saying that \u201ccountries who have been at the forefront [are now] pumping the brakes on this,\u201d something that Kavanaugh noted gave the court \u201ca yellow light, if not a red light\u201d in moving forward into \u201cconstitutionalizing\u201d a new area of law.\n\nBut it was perhaps the line of questioning from Alito that was the most intense of the morning. Alito, too, cited specific studies from Sweden and England, including the bombshell Cass report, which indicated that gender medicine is largely unproven and presents significant health risks to children.\n\nHe chided Prelogar, saying that she had \u201crelegated [it] to a footnote.\u201d\n\nIn their briefs, both the government and the ACLU asserted a different basis on which the court could provide relief.\n\nIf the justices didn\u2019t think the law discriminated based on sex, they could find that the law discriminated on the basis of transgender status, and that, too, they argued, would require that the law be subject to intermediate scrutiny review. This alternative argument also took center stage in Wednesday\u2019s argument. A majority of the justices, however, did not seem to buy it.\n\nBoth Barrett and Alito pointed out that the court had turned down other requests to expand constitutionally protected categories, such as age and mental disability. Their line of demarcation in equal protection clause cases had always been immutable characteristics\u2014those derived by accident of birth, such as race, sex, and national origin.\n\nSo, when transgender lawyer Chase Strangio took the podium for the ACLU, Alito continued his grilling, asking pointedly \u201cIs transgender status immutable?\u201d When Strangio responded that it would indeed \u201csatisfy an immutability test,\u201d Alito peppered the ACLU lawyer with various hypotheticals: What about people who are \u201cgender-fluid,\u201d or who change gender identities over time, or who are \u201cnonbinary\u201d?\n\n\u2018An Immutable Characteristic\u2019?\nWhen Strangio floundered, Alito retorted, \u201cSo, transgender status is not an immutable characteristic, is it?\u201d\n\nUnsurprisingly, the more liberal members of the court, Jackson and Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, appeared more favorable to Prelogar\u2019s and Strangio\u2019s arguments. Jackson likened the current case to Loving v. Virginia, the court\u2019s landmark civil rights decision that determined that laws banning interracial marriage violated the Equal Protection and Due Process clauses of the 14th Amendment.\n\nIn arguing that the state had once legislated in such a way based on racial classifications, and that the court had overridden those state legislative judgments based on the Constitution\u2019s promise of equality, Jackson argued it should do the same here.  Twenty-six states have passed laws similar to Tennessee\u2019s in the past few years, and some of them have been challenged in the courts. But U.S. v. Skrmetti is the first case of its kind to reach the Supreme Court.\n\nThe court\u2019s decision, which likely won\u2019t be issued till June, no doubt will have a significant impact on the legislative and litigation efforts on this controversial issue for years to come.\n",

    "full_text": "Chris Mosier: \u201cTrans athletes play sports for the same reasons as anybody else. For our love of the game.\u201d Chris Mosier is an out transgender athlete, and a trailblazer, and he\u2019s speaking out about President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order that seeks to ban transgender athletes from competing in women\u2019s and girl\u2019s school-sponsored sports.\n\nMosier told CNN, \u201cSports has just been the entry point to other areas of discrimination against our community, including health care access, safety in schools, removing things from school curriculum about transgender people, and so on.\u201d\n\nMosier is the first transgender athlete to represent the United States in international competition, first transgender athlete in the ESPN Body Issue, and first transgender athlete sponsored by Nike. He\u2019s also the first transgender athlete to qualify for the Olympic Trials in the gender they identify.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no evidence that trans athletes have an advantage over anyone else in sports,\u201d Mosier continued. \u201cTrans athletes play sports for the same reasons as anybody else. For our love of the game, to be a part of a team, to challenge ourselves, and most of all, at the youth level, to have fun. And every young person deserves that opportunity to be their authentic self and to play the sports they love without compromising any part of who they are.\u201d\n\nLike many of the Trump executive orders, there are inherent contradictions and inconsistencies. The executive order gives instructions to the Department of Education, which President Trump has already strongly hinted he wants to close, and that legally must happen through a law passed in Congress. It threatens to defund education institutions that permit transgender athletes to participate in sports. The order falsely claims that including trans participation is a violation of Title IX, the federal legislation that prohibits sex-based discrimination in educational settings. In essence, it is encouraging discrimination by weaponizing protections against discrimination to target transgender people. \n\nNCAA President Charlie Baker testified in December that he knew of \u201cless than 10\u201d transgender collegiate athletes out of 510,000 total. He did not specify how many of those athletes are transgender women, who are specifically targeted by the order. The NCAA announced on Feb. 6, the day after Trump signed the nonbinding executive order, that its Board of Governors voted to update the Association\u2019s participation policy for transgender student-athletes. The new policy limits competition in women\u2019s sports to student-athletes assigned female at birth only.\nThe decision was made without consulting the NCAA\u2019s board of medical experts that has advised the NCAA for years on safety and fairness. Dr. Jack Turban announced he is resigning from the NCAA Committee on Competitive Safeguards and Medical Aspects of Sports, stating: \u201cIt is clear that your decision was based on politics and not science, as the CSMAS was not consulted prior to the decision.\u201d\n\nThere is no evidence of a need for this new policy, or the need to immediately implement it. Instruction from the Department of Education to educational institutions that would guide the policy and its enforcement will likely take months and then will be subject to legal scrutiny.\n\nThe administration currently has no Secretary of Education, and its nominee, has yet to answer questions about her role in accusations of enabling sexual assault and exploitation of children. \n\nTransgender people have been playing sports for decades. The NCAA and International Olympic Committee (IOC) have developed scientifically-based guidelines to ensure fairness and inclusion for at least a decade. And research shows states that include transgender participation have more girls participating in sports than states with bans.\n\nSports bans are part of a systematic and expanding targeting of transgender people and youth that has surged to include their medically-necessary and supported health care, book bans and curriculum bans, and access to the restroom. This ban follows executive orders that challenges the right of out trans people to serve in the military, and the right of transgender people to receive health care. \n\n\u201cSo we can see that this is a part of a larger picture,\u201d Mosier said. \u201cAnd the talking point of trying to ban trans women and girls from girls and women\u2019s sports has just been so incredibly divisive that it\u2019s been what they\u2019ve latched onto to kick off discrimination against our community.\u201d\n\nJournalist and activist for transgender rights Raquel Willis spoke to ABC News about the ban: \u201cThis has never really been about trans women and girls in sports. This has always been about trying to erase us from society, from access to health care, employment, education, safety and security. We are not going to let this happen. Trans folks and the folks who love us and support us and understand our brilliance are rising up.\u201d\n\nWillis continued, \u201cI want us to see the connections around all of the attacks, the attacks on our immigrant family, our undocumented immigrant family, that is part and parcel of the attacks on transgender people. The attacks on our passports\u2014right now we\u2019re not able to change our gender to have our true identity reflected there, that is a document and security that ties us to the fights against immigrants right now. The attacks on DEI\u2014if you have an administration who says you don\u2019t exist, how are you going to get a job? We need a culture of deeper empathy.\u201d\n\nGLAAD also responded to the proposed ban: \u201cThis administration\u2019s latest inaccurate and incoherent piece of paper smears an entire group of Americans but does not change the law or the facts. All women and girls, including transgender women and girls, should be welcome to play sports if they want, make decisions about their own bodies, be hired for jobs they are qualified for, and be free from lawless attacks by extremists in elected office.\u201d\n\nMany of Trump\u2019s executive orders have been blocked in court as unconstitutional and illegal. Multiple orders are being challenged in court.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s record of targeting LGBTQ people is documented on the Trump Accountability Tracker.",

    "full_text": "USA Fencing responds to federal investigation over transgender competitor incident USA Fencing has acknowledged a forthcoming federal investigation into an incident that occurred at one of its events where a women's fencer was punished for refusing to face a transgender competitor. \n\nThe investigation, which will be carried out by the newly-formed Title IX investigations team in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Education and Department of Justice, was announced on Friday by Education Secretary Linda McMahon. \n\nThe incident, which occurred at the Cherry Blossom Open in Maryland on March 30, saw female fencer Stephanie Turner take a knee in protest of trans competitor Redmond Sullivan. Turner was then disqualified from the event and escorted out of the venue.\n\nUSA Fencing provided a statement to Fox News Digital saying it will cooperate with the investigation. \n\n\"USA Fencing will respond and cooperate to any inquiry as required by law,\" the statement read. The incident involving Turner quickly drew national attention after a video of her taking a knee to protest Sullivan went viral. The footage ignited widespread awareness and backlash against USA Fencing's gender eligibility policies. \n\nTurner told Fox News Digital that she came to the decision to take the knee the night before the event, when she checked the competition pools and saw that she would be competing against Sullivan.\n\n\"I saw that I was going to be in a pool with Redmond, and from there I said, \u2018OK, let\u2019s do it. I'm going to take the knee,'\" Turner said. \"I knew what I had to do because USA Fencing had not been listening to women's objections regarding [its gender eligibility policy].\" USA Fencing first enacted its current trans-inclusion policy in 2023. It allows transgender athletes to compete in the women's category at both the junior and senior level after completing one calendar year of testosterone suppression treatment. Proof of compliant hormone therapy must be provided prior to competition, but the organization has taken even further steps to prioritize its trans competitors. \n\nIn November 2022, it announced a policy to give preference when selecting host cities for national tournaments to states without laws that \"harm members of LGBTQ communities\" and states that do not \"have laws undermining the reproductive health of women.\" That policy went into effect in the 2023 season, the same year it changed its gender policy. It later released a list of states that it intended to \"avoid where possible\" and the states that it flat out would not allow hosting major events. This past December, a nonprofit fencing organization, the Fair Fencing Organization, penned an open letter to USA Fencing Board Members urging the re-evaluation of its stance on several issues, including transgender inclusion. Just days later, however, board members voted against several motions to approve an all-female task force to re-evaluate and revise the current transgender policy, in an 8-3 vote. \n\nNow, after siding against women fencers seeking protection from trans inclusion, USA Fencing faces potential federal sanctions.\n\nThis Title IX investigation will be one of the first missions for the newly formed Title IX investigations team, which was officially formed last week. The initiative was announced last Friday with the mission to \"protect female athletes, from the pernicious effects of gender ideology in school programs and activities.\"",

    "full_text": "Trans Activists Take Over Women\u2019s Bathroom On Capitol Hill Transgender activists took over at least one women\u2019s bathroom Thursday on Capitol Hill.\n\nLaw enforcement arrested approximately 15 demonstrators protesting against Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson\u2019s recent ban on biological men entering bathrooms and facilities of the female sex, according to Axios.\n\nVideo shows a crowd of protesters clog a hall near a women\u2019s bathroom while holding signs. This took place in the Cannon House Office Building close to Johnson\u2019s office. One sign read, \u201cCongress Stop Pissing on Our Rights!\u201d\n\nJohnson\u2019s bathroom ban issued to protect women\u2019s spaces from infiltrating males came after Republican South Carolina Rep. Nancy Mace raised the issue by introducing a bill before Democratic Delaware Representative-elect Sarah McBride \u2014 the first ever representative to identify as transgender \u2014 is sworn in. (RELATED: Nancy Mace Introduces Bill To Block Trans Woman From Capitol Bathrooms)\n\nThe activist group echoed chants of \u201cSpeaker Johnson, Nancy Mace,\u201d \u201cour bodies are not debate\u201d and \u201cour genders are not debate.\u201d\n\nChelsea Manning was among the pro-transgender activists occupying the women\u2019s bathroom, according to Axios. It is unknown whether authorities took Manning into custody.\n\nDemocrats were not off the hook when it came to the issue as protesters chanted, \u201cDemocrats, grow a spine! Trans rights are on the line.\u201d\n\nA transgender activist posted a video on social media while appearing to use the women\u2019s bathroom. \u201cMeeting in the ladies room at the US Capital,\u201d TikTok user RealTayChaTLC wrote in the caption to the video.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m coming in the ladies room to shake the dew off my lily. I\u2019m gonna shake the dew off my lily. I\u2019m gonna pop a squat. I swear, nothing bad\u2019s gonna happen. I\u2019m just going pee,\u201d the user said on camera, shutting the stall door and sitting down. \u201cSo I\u2019m sitting in the toilet, and I\u2019m going pee. I know this is newsworthy. I don\u2019t know why. But I just wanted to let you know that everything\u2019s coming out okay. And I hope you have a really nice day.\u201d\n\nThe women\u2019s bathroom blockage was organized by the Gender Liberation Movement, which issued a statement saying the protest \u201csets an example of the righteous defiance and solidarity needed under a second Trump administration.\u201c\n\n\u201cEveryone deserves to use the restroom without fear of discrimination or violence. Trans folks are no different. We deserve dignity and respect and we will fight until we get it,\u201d GLM co-founder Raquel Willis said.\n\nMace delivered a \u201cspecial message\u201d \u2014 megaphone in hand \u2014 to demonstrators in a video posted on X after the arrests were made.\n\n    Protestors came to the Capitol today to protest my bathroom bill. Poor things got arrested. So, I have a special message for them.#HoldTheLine pic.twitter.com/BK88X0BfBa\n\n    \u2014 Nancy Mace (@NancyMace) December 5, 2024\n\n\u201cSo, some tranny protesters showed up at the Capitol today to protest my bathroom bill. But they got arrested \u2014 poor things. So, I have a message for the protesters who got arrested. You ready?\u201d the congresswoman said, raising her megaphone.\n\n\u201cYou have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law,\u201d Mace spoke into the megaphone. \u201cYou have the right to speak to an attorney [and have an attorney] present during any question. If you cannot afford an attorney \u2014 I doubt many of you can \u2014 one will be provided to you at the government\u2019s expense.\u201d",

    "full_text": "Pro-LGBTQ Candidates Prevail in Wisconsin\u2019s Spring Election; Voters Reject Campaigns Targeting Transgender People Voters in Wisconsin have elected two candidates who support LGBTQ equality in the state\u2019s hotly contested Spring Election. Susan Crawford was elevated to the state Supreme Court and Jill Underly will return as State Superintendent of Public Instruction.\n\nBoth candidates defeated opponents and campaign ads that targeted LGBTQ people, including a late surge of ads and text messages that baselessly spread fear about transgender people.\n\nThe Grio also reports that voters in La Crosse, Wisconsin, made history on Tuesday when they elected the city\u2019s first Black and first out gay mayor, Shaundel Washington-Spivey.\n\nA high number of voters turned out, with reports that polling places needed to print more ballots to accommodate. The race was billed as a \u201clitmus test,\u201d ABC News reported, for voters to \u201cget the chance to weigh in on President Donald Trump\u2019s agenda,\u201d and express their opinion on the actions of Trump\u2019s billionaire donor and \u201cDOGE\u201d leader Elon Musk.\n\nMusk and related political action committees contributed more than $20million to Brad Schimel\u2019s campaign, making this the most expensive judicial race in history. Musk personally campaigned in Wisconsin to offer two voters one million dollars each.\n\nGLAAD and Fair Wisconsin had documented the LGBTQ and equality records of the supreme court candidates.\n\nCrawford\u2019s election secures a pro-equality majority on the court, which could decide on abortion access, voting rights, and accurately representative voting districts for the state legislature.\n\nSchimel made several appearances at Alliance Defending Freedom events, LGBTQ Nation reported. The group was designated an anti-LGBTQ+ hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center. Schimel aired an anti-trans ad during the campaign attacking Crawford for supporting transgender rights.\n\nCrawford defeated Brad Schimel by 10 percent (55% and over 1,300,000 votes / 45% and over 1,050,000 votes). Crawford spoke out against Musk\u2019s attempts to influence the election. \u201cI\u2019ve got to tell you, as a little girl growing up in Chippewa Falls, I never could have imagined that I\u2019d be taking on the richest man in the world,\u201d Crawford said. \u201cAnd we won.\u201d\n\nState Superintendent of Public Instruction Jill Underly beat Brittany Kinser by five percent (52.9% and over 1,100,000 votes / 47.1% and over 1,000,000 votes). Underly spoke in support of LGBTQ students during the campaign: \u201cSchools should be inclusive spaces where all students feel safe, supported and able to fully participate in extracurricular activities. Excluding transgender students from sports not only harms their mental health and well-being but also goes against the principles of fairness and equal opportunity in education.\u201d Kinser had campaigned to exclude trans students from school sports, and advocated for private school vouchers that compete for funding with public schools.\n\n\u201cThese results are a victory for LGBTQ+ rights in Wisconsin, and a victory for every Wisconsinite as we build a more fair, more inclusive state,\u201d said Abigail Swetz, Executive Director of Fair Wisconsin.\n\n\u201cThey show a strong commitment to a Wisconsin that lives up to our state motto \u201cForward.\u201d Thank you, Wisconsin, for voting for equality and against the cynical use of our LGBTQ+ community as political pawns.\u201d\n\n\u201cWisconsin voters spoke out on behalf of LGBTQ people and for future elections to be fair and free of interference from self-serving billionaires,\u201d GLAAD President and CEO Sarah Kate Ellis said.\n\n\u201cLies and fearmongering about transgender people do not win elections. Wisconsin sent a message of support for the health and safety of each person, and reaffirmed that every vote and every voter matters.\u201d\n\n\u201cSusan Crawford\u2019s victory is a rejection of extremism and a clear message that Wisconsinites want to protect our civil liberties, reproductive rights, and environment,\u201d said Milwaukee LGBTQ activist and GLAAD Media Institute Alumni Kat Klawes.\n\n\u201cVoters turned out in historic numbers, so many that some polling places ran out of ballots because they know what\u2019s at stake: the right to control our own bodies, breathe clean air and live in a democracy where every vote truly counts.\u201d\n\nApproximately 207,000 LGBTQ people live in Wisconsin. Due to a varying patchwork of local laws, only 21% of Wisconsin\u2019s population is protected from discrimination based on gender identity, with 12% partially protected in limited areas such as employment, housing, or public accommodations.\n\n\u201cThe identities we hold matter, and while race is a social construct, at the end of the day, who we are in our lived existence needs to be understood, appreciated and respected for what it is,\u201d LaCrosse\u2019s newly elected mayor said.\n\n\u201cI just look forward to making sure that we bring this community together across difference, across socio-economic status, across race, gender, sexual orientation, all of those things to ensure that we truly build a community that\u2019s for everybody.\u201d",

    "full_text": "Illinois School Staff Watched To Ensure Girls Changed In Front Of Trans-Identifying Boy, Mom Says The mother of a girl attending an Illinois middle school said that after her daughter refused to change her clothes in front of a biological boy who identified as a transgender girl, school officials stepped in and forced her to do so.\n\nNicole Georgas told the story of what she said happened to her 13-year-old daughter and other girls at Shepard Middle School while speaking at a Deerfield School District 109 School Board meeting on Thursday, National Review reported. Deerfield is a suburb of Chicago. Georgas said her daughter came home upset on February 5, saying a boy was using the girl\u2019s bathroom.\n\nAccording to Georgas, the girl was then told by school administrators that the boy was allowed to use the girl\u2019s locker room and bathroom because he identified as a girl, and the school\u2019s \u201cinclusive\u201d bathroom policy allowed him to use whichever locker room he wanted. Georgas said she spoke to school administrators and told them they were violating President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order that prohibited males from using female locker rooms and participating in girls\u2019 sports. The school stood its ground, citing the district\u2019s legal counsel.\n\nAfter this exchange, Georgas said Thursday, \u201cthe situation went from bad to worse.\u201d\n\n\u201cA few days later, the male student was present in the girl\u2019s locker room. Feeling violated, the girls made the choice not to change into their PE clothes with the biological male student present,\u201d Georgas said.\n\nThe mother said that school administrators then supervised the girls\u2019 locker room to make sure that the girls changed their clothes in front of the transgender-identifying boy without protest. She identified the district\u2019s assistant superintendent for student services, the school\u2019s assistant principal, and the director for student services as the administrators who forced the girls to change in front of the boy, according to the Lake County Gazette.\n\n\u201cThe girls just want their privacy and they want their locker room back,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are gender neutral options. This is my daughter\u2019s story, and the story of many other young girls who have been forced at the difficult age to do something they know and most adults know is wrong.\u201d\n\nGeorgas\u2019 story received boos from transgender activists in attendance at the school board meeting, including one transgender-identifying person who also happens to have a child identifying as transgender.\n\n\u201cThe discomfort or privacy concerns of other students, teachers, or parents are not valid reasons to deny or limit the full and equal use of those facilities based on a student\u2019s gender-related identity,\u201d said the activist, who serves as the director of operations for Trans Up Front, an activist organization. \u201cInstead, any student, teacher or other individuals seeking more privacy should be accommodated by providing that individual with a more private option.\u201d\n\nGeorgas said she filed a civil rights complaint with the Justice Department.",

    "full_text": "Planned Parenthood of Arizona \u201cPauses\u201d Gender Affirming Care for Trans Adults Clariece, a 23-year-old trans woman in Mesa, Arizona, said she got the phone call late on Friday from her Planned Parenthood doctor\u2019s office. It was in regards to her routine appointment that Monday\u2014the office was cancelling her visit, and all upcoming visits for trans patients seeking gender affirming care in the coming week.\n\n\u201cWe are hoping that this is a temporary pause for the next week,\u201d a representative said, as per a voicemail left to Clariece. The office said they would reach out when they knew they could reschedule.\n\nClareice was able to find another provider\u2014missing even a week of hormone replacement therapy can be destabilizing, and it can be a major setback due to the stringent regulations on hormones for trans patients\u2014but since getting the call, she says she\u2019s felt \"the sword of Damocles\u201d hanging over her head.\n\n\u201cEven a little bump can push back when you go and see somebody, which pushes back when you get your lab work, which pushes back when you can get a new prescription written, and that all means there will probably be a gap,\u201d she told Erin in the Morning. (She spoke on the condition that her last name be omitted from publication due to privacy concerns.)\n\nBy Saturday, April 12, Erin in the Morning reported that the Planned Parenthood of Arizona had added a new banner on its website.\n\n\u201cAt this time, Planned Parenthood Arizona is pausing Gender Affirming Care services,\u201d the header reads. \u201cWe are committed to keeping our patients updated about the services we provide and will communicate further once we can provide more information.\u201d\n\nIt says the catalyst for the stoppage was an April 11 letter from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) which ordered Medicaid agencies to halt funding for any clinics that provide gender affirming care for trans people.\n\nThe CMS is a government agency led by Mehmet Oz\u2014a doctor-turned-media-mogul-turned-politician whose claim to fame is promoting dangerous \u201cmiracle\u201d (pseudoscientific) weight loss drugs and cancer cures to a live studio audience via The Dr. Oz Show.\n\n\u201cInitiated with an underdeveloped body of evidence, [gender affirming] interventions lack reliable evidence of long-term benefits for minors,\u201d the CMS letter reads.\n\nPut simply, this is not true. Every major medical association supports affirming health care for transgender youth. Meanwhile, the CMS letter cites Southern Poverty Law Center-designated hate groups known for dubious, anti-LGBT \u201cscience,\u201d such as Do No Harm, which was founded to stop \u201cwoke\u201d health care, and the Society for Evidence-Based Gender Medicine, which pushes conversion therapy for trans kids.\n\nBut the Planned Parenthood of Arizona\u2019s pause on care is not just about kids; adults are also barred from gender affirming care.\n\nPlanned Parenthood did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nIn 2021, Dr. Bhavik Kumar, the medical director of primary and trans care at Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast, told NPR that over 35,000 patients nationwide had sought gender affirming hormone replacement therapy at Planned Parenthood clinics that year.\n\nAccording to Kumar, in areas where gender affirming care is sparse, Planned Parenthood may be the only place where transgender people can access health care, period.\n\n\"When that's taken away,\u201d he said, \u201cthey're left sometimes with no options.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, many scholars have denounced medical institutions for over-complying with attacks on trans-affirming care. In New York, activists plastered protest signs on sites associated with NYU Langone, which went above and beyond the law (if not against the law) when it cancelled medical appointments for trans youth. And protestors have gathered at hospitals across the country calling on health care providers to support trans patients.\n\nGender affirming care bans are \u201cintentionally vague,\u201d according to Rev. Jasmine Beach-Ferrara, Executive Director of the Campaign for Southern Equality, in a 2023 report on such bans. She said that this serves to intimidate and pressure providers of gender affirming care for trans people. The report found that \u201covercompliance leads to compounding harms for transgender youth.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen medical institutions shutter services that they are not legally required to, and we\u2019ve seen illegal denials of pharmaceutical care,\u201d she said. \u201cAs advocates fight these laws in the courts and on the ground, we urge medical providers, pharmacies, and communities at large to not make this crisis worse through overcompliance with the law.\u201d",

    "full_text": "U.K. Minister Says Trans Women Should Use Bathrooms That Correspond to Their \u201cBiological Sex\u201d The U.K. Department of Education\u2019s Minister for Women and Equalities, Bridget Phillipson, said that trans women should use bathrooms that correspond with their sex assigned at birth, although she stopped short of explicitly saying that trans women should use men\u2019s restrooms.\n\nPhillipson, who is a member of the U.K.\u2019s ruling Labour Party, appeared on Tuesday\u2019s edition of BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today program. During the interview, BBC presenter Anna Foster asked her which public restroom trans women should use following the U.K. Supreme Court\u2019s April 16 ruling that the legal definitions of \u201cman\u201d and \u201cwoman\u201d in the 2010 Equality Act are based on a person\u2019s \u201cbiological sex\u201d as assigned at birth. It is a question that another Labour minister, MP Karin Smyth, seemed unable to answer last week.\n\nPhillipson appears to have more clarity. Sort of. \u201cThe ruling was clear that provisions and services should be accessed on the basis of biological sex,\u201d Phillipson said.\n\nShe added that the U.K.\u2019s Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) \u201cwill be setting out additional guidance and a statutory code of practice, because we need to make sure that everyone has the ability to access services that are safe and appropriate, and respect their privacy and dignity.\u201d\n\nAccording to the BBC, the Equality Act 2010 allows for single-sex spaces and services that aren\u2019t considered discriminatory, when a user can reasonably object to the space being open to members of the opposite sex. Last week\u2019s Supreme Court ruling means that even if a trans woman has a gender recognition certificate, she can be barred from a woman\u2019s single-sex space like a bathroom.\n\nFoster continued to press Phillipson during their interview, replying, \u201cAnd just for clarity\u2026 If you are a trans woman, you\u2019re out in public, you need to use the toilet today, it is the men\u2019s toilet that you use?\u201d\n\nPhillipson repeated her first response verbatim before continuing, \u201cI know that many businesses, large and small, will ensure that they have appropriate provisions in place. For example, many businesses have moved towards unisex provision or separate [bathroom] cubicles that can be used by anyone.\u201d\n\nFoster pointed out that in some cases, \u201cthat third space doesn\u2019t exist yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn many cases, those do already exist, including in small businesses,\u201d Phillipson replied. \u201cThey do. Go into your local caf\u00e9, a local family caf\u00e9, chances are, you\u2019ll have one cubicle that\u2019s self-contained, that can be used by anyone.\u201d\n\nPhillipson\u2019s public position on which bathrooms trans women should use has shifted since last June, when the Labour Party announced plans to streamline the process that allows trans people to get approval for gender recognition certificates (GRCs), the document that changes a person\u2019s recorded sex, and registered trans women as legally female and trans men as legally male. The plan would have made it less burdensome for trans people to meet the criteria required to obtain GRCs.\n\nWhen Phillipson was pressed on which bathrooms trans women with gender recognition certificates should use during a June Times Radio interview, she responded, \u201cI would expect that if you were someone that had gone through that formal process of recognition you are, to all intents and purposes, for legal purposes, regarded as being in a different gender regardless of the sex into which you were born\u2026 I would think that in those cases people would be using female toilets.\u201d\n\nPhillipson isn\u2019t the first government minister who could or would not explain which public bathrooms trans people are now expected to use following the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling. When Karin Smyth, Minister of State for the Department of Health and Social Care, was asked whether trans women can use women\u2019s services and facilities during a Times Radio interview, she told the outlet that it is a \u201clarge complex issue\u201d that \u201cvaries upon what the provision of those service providers are.\u201d\n\nLabour Party leader and current Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who said last year that he opposes \u201cgender ideology\u201d and that \u201cbiological women\u2019s spaces need to be protected,\u201d praised the ruling shortly after it was issued last week. On Tuesday, the BBC reported that a spokesperson for Starmer said that he does not believe transgender women are women. This is a change from Starmer\u2019s position just a few years ago; in 2022, when he was an MP and leader of the Opposition Party, he said that trans women are women.\n\n\u201cNo, the Supreme Court judgment has made clear that when looking at the Equality Act, a woman is a biological woman,\u201d the spokesperson stated.\n\nAccording to U.K. legal experts and LGBTQ+ advocacy groups, the ruling may have sweeping negative consequences not only for trans people, but for intersex people and cis women as well.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re yet to see how all of this will play out in practice, but it seems clear that this won\u2019t just hurt the trans community. The reasoning adopted, and the relentless desire to police \u2018what is a woman\u2019 can only hurt our wider communities,\u201d legal researcher Jess O\u2019Thomson wrote for the U.K.-based LGBTQ+ website QueerAF last Wednesday. \u201cNow is the time to work in solidarity with other marginalised groups, and resist an establishment which wants to force us into even smaller boxes.\u201d\n\n",

    "full_text": "Indiana judge rules prison must provide transgender surgery for inmate who killed baby A federal judge has ruled that it would be unconstitutional for an Indiana prison to deny a transgender inmate sex reassignment surgery following the inmate's lawsuit against the facility.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) sued the Indiana Department of Corrections last year on behalf of a transgender inmate, Jonathan C. Richardson, also known as Autumn Cordellion\u00e8, who was convicted of strangling his 11-month-old stepdaughter to death in 2001.\n\nIndiana law, however, prohibits the Department of Corrections from using taxpayer dollars to fund sex reassignment surgeries for inmates. However, the ACLU argues in the lawsuit, filed on Aug. 28, 2023, that the law is a violation of the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition of \"cruel and unusual punishment.\"\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) sued the Indiana Department of Corrections on behalf of a transgender inmate, Jonathan C. Richardson, also known as Autumn Cordellion\u00e8, who was convicted of strangling his 11-month-old stepdaughter to death in 2001. (Indiana Department of Corrections/Getty Images)\n\nThe surgery for Richardson, who is serving out a 55-year prison sentence for reckless homicide, \"is a medical necessity,\" according to the ACLU lawsuit.\n\nJudge Richard Young agreed with the ACLU's claims and ruled in favor of Cordellion\u00e9 last week.\n\n\"Specifically, Ms. Cordellion\u00e9 has shown that her gender dysphoria is a serious medical need, and that, despite other treatments Defendant has provided her to treat her gender dysphoria, she requires gender-affirming surgery to prevent a risk of serious bodily and psychological harm,\" the ruling states.\n\nThe DOC must now take \"all reasonable actions\" to ensure Cordellion\u00e9 undergoes sex surgery, according to the order.\n\nIndiana Attorney General Todd Rokita, a Republican, said in a post on X that his office is still reviewing the judge's decision, \"but you can undoubtedly expect our office to appeal this decision.\"\n\n\"An Indiana inmate convicted of murder wants our taxpayers to fund their gender-altering surgery! Hoosiers do NOT want thism\" Rokita said.\n\nThe original ACLU filing says Cordellion\u00e9 was diagnosed in 2020 with gender dysphoria and prescribed female hormones and testosterone blockers, both of which he has \"consistently taken since that time.\" Other accommodations provided for the inmate include \"panties, make up, and form fitting clothing.\"\n\n\"Accordingly, at this point gender-affirming surgery is necessary so that her physical identity can be aligned with her gender identity and so her gender dysphoria can be ameliorated,\" the lawsuit states.\n\n\"She believes that the only remedy for her persistent gender dysphoria, and the serious harm it causes her, is to receive gender-affirming surgery, specifically an orchiectomy and vaginoplasty,\" it said.\n\nCordellion\u00e9 has identified as a woman since 6 years old, the ACLU lawsuit also claims, and the inmate is \"a woman trapped in a man's body.\"\n\nAccording to court documents, Cordellion\u00e9 strangled his then-wife\u2019s 11-month-year old daughter to death while she was at work on Sept. 12, 2001. During RCordellion\u00e9's initial interview with one of the detectives, he was calm and \"unemotional\" when recounting what happened, court documents from Indiana's Court of Appeals show. ",

    "full_text": "Research Explores How Trans Technologies are Removing Barriers to Access and Visibility Trans Technologies, a new book from MIT Press and written by University of Michigan researcher and faculty member Oliver L. Haimson, Ph.D. explores the creative and novel ways technologies are being utilized to address the inequalities the transgender community faces, highlight and correct misinformation, and grow safety, acceptance, equitability, and visibility.\n\n\u201cTrans technologies,\u201d as Haimson explains in the book (he also includes definitions from trans tech creators), are \u201cbuilt or adapted to address the specific concerns and needs of trans people and communities.\u201d On a more theoretical level, trans technologies \u201cembody or support themes or characteristics of transness.\u201d Haimson uses a broad brush to paint his definition, adapting the concept to a wide variety of digital and analog applications \u201cdesigned or adapted to help address some of the challenges transgender people face,\u201d including basic needs such as access to society, employment, health care, and housing. Examples include, but are not limited to:\n\nApps \u2013 U-Signal, a prototype smartphone and smartwatch app to aid transgender people of color in identifying and reporting threats to their safety. The Safe Transgender Bathroom app (2021-22) helped trans people find safe/gender-neutral restrooms.\nMaps \u2013 Trans activist and journalist Erin Reed created a map to assist trans people with finding health care providers who offer hormone therapy without requiring patients to obtain a letter of eligibility \u201cfrom a therapist or psychiatrist.\u201d Reed also created a map to identify legislative attacks against the transgender community in each state.\nWebsites \u2013 The Digital Transgender Archive offers a collection of historical transgender materials, including periodicals, news articles, photography.\nBrowser extensions \u2013 Deadname Remover updates \u201ctrans people\u2019s previous names with their current ones,\u201d while Gender Neutralize replaces gendered terms with \u201cgender-neutral alternatives.\u201d\nVideo games, augmented reality, and virtual reality \u2013 Through the Wardrobe uses augmented reality to empower \u201cvisitors [to] try out new identities via clothing and other artifacts.\u201d Trans Fucking Rage Jam (2022) gave trans game developers the agency to channel their anger over anti-trans legislation into creative projects. Woven throughout the book, \u201ccare\u201d and \u201cambivalence\u201d serve as grounding forces, illustrating the (sometimes simultaneous) push and pull each trans tech creator faces in concepting and creating technology to meet their own individual needs or, more ideally, working with the broader transgender community, including people with multiple marginalized identities, to address one or more of the 14 categories of challenges transgender people face, as identified by Haimson and his team of researchers. The U-Signal prototype addresses \u201cracial injustice,\u201d for example, while the Safe Transgender Bathroom app targeted \u201caccess to society.\u201d Another category, \u201cpressure to educate cisgender people about trans identities,\u201d includes The Trans Language Primer, a web site that defines more than 200 LGBTQ terms.\n\n\u201cTrans care\u201d demonstrates the ways transgender people \u201cshow up for each other when society and family fail them.\u201d Meanwhile, ambivalence, a word Haimson notes \u201chas a particularly trans quality,\u201d involves \u201ctwo or more distant (maybe opposite) poles between which a person wavers and that they contemplate simultaneously.\u201d For example, trans tech creators \u201chave agency to create technology that addresses some trans needs,\u201d but can\u2019t solve the societal issues at the root of them \u2013 a moving target that continues to grow with each anti-LGBTQ executive order issued, law enacted, and the continued proliferation of hate speech online and in public settings.\n\nAnother ambivalence includes funding sources for trans technology: \u201ccapitalist and anticapitalist approaches, funders\u2019 values and community values, paid work and volunteer work, profit and mutual aid,\u201d among others. \u201cWhile each of these pairs may seem like opposites,\u201d Haimson explains, \u201cin reality they are closer than they seem,\u201d and may involve more than one approach.\n\nTrans Technologies comes at a critical moment for the transgender community. Since assuming office in January, President Donald Trump has spent an outsize amount of time targeting transgender people and censoring evidence of their existence. These efforts include restricting federal websites from nearly 200 words used to describe marginalized people and communities, including LGBTQ, gender-affirming care, transgender, nonbinary, Black, race and racism, DEI, and yes, even the word \u201cmarginalized\u201d itself.\n\nAlso at risk is important and life-saving academic research. President Trump\u2019s recent anti-transgender executive orders have attempted to withdraw hundreds of research grants at several prominent educational institutions. In response, and to protect federal funding, universities throughout the country are scaling back or ending DEI efforts.\n\nHaimson explained to GLAAD the cooling effect the Trump Administration\u2019s harmful actions could have on future transgender research, including studies on the impact of trans technology on the community:\n\n\u201cThe funding cuts to scientific research and universities will have tangible negative effects for so many marginalized groups, including trans people,\u201d Haimson said.\n\n\u201cWith the crackdown on \u2018DEI\u2019 research and the list of words that academics have been advised to no longer use in grant proposals, research that aims to improve trans people\u2019s life chances is unlikely to be funded in the future (at least in the next four years). I have already seen my colleagues who are doing crucial trans health research have their NIH grant funding taken away, which means that we will have less knowledge about health disparities and action towards how to address them.\u201d\n\nHaimson warned that the absence of federal funding will require the support of trans folks \u201cwho typically have very little financial means and resources.\u201d\n\nTrans Technologies is the result of interviews with more than 100 English-speaking technology creators, 80 percent of whom are transgender and/or nonbinary. Haimson acknowledges this limitation in not including non-Western technologies and perspectives, and that he and many of his interviewees come from \u201crelatively privileged\u201d backgrounds in terms of education and socio-economic status. Regardless, Trans Technologies offers readers a thorough, yet approachable look at the types of technologies and their effects, both positive and negative, on transgender people and the trans community at large.\n\nTrans Technologies can be purchased through most major booksellers. A digital edition of the book is also available at no cost on the MIT Press website.",

    "full_text": "Trump's passport policy leaves trans, intersex Americans in the lurch Louie figured he was taking a gamble when he submitted his passport application after President Trump's inauguration.\n\nHe had a passport, which was valid for another two years. But at the end of December, a New York state court approved Louie's request to change his name and gender marker. As a result, he needed a new passport \u2014 regardless of who was in office. Louie asked NPR to identify him by his first name because he fears harassment and retaliation at work.\n\nLouie, 24, identifies as transmasculine. At the end of 2024 and early January, he changed his driver's license and Social Security card to reflect the female-to-male gender marker update. It went smoothly, he told NPR.\n\nThe trouble started in January, when he submitted his application for a new passport \u2014 just hours after Trump took office on Jan. 20.\n\nThe same day, Trump issued an executive order stating that the federal government recognizes only two sexes, male and female. That led the State Department to eliminate the X gender as an option and to suspend its policy allowing transgender, intersex and nonbinary people to update the sex field of their passports.\n\nThis executive order has upended the lives of individuals in prisons, at schools, seeking health care and in sports. It's now disrupting the lives of some trans, nonbinary and intersex people when they travel.\n\nAn estimated 1.3 million adults in the U.S. identify as transgender or gender nonconforming, and as many as 5 million Americans may be intersex, according to a brief published last month from the Williams Institute, a think tank at UCLA Law School that researches sexual orientation and gender identity. Those who spoke to NPR for this story say the policy change is yet another example of the Trump administration's persecution of the LGBTQ+ community by creating new barriers in their daily lives.\n\nThe changes resulting from the executive order also mean that the gender identity of trans, nonbinary and intersex people won't be reflected in official documents, they say, forcing them to \"out\" themselves every time they present their passports \u2014 heightening their distress and fear and adding unpredictable logistical and safety challenges for travel and even everyday life.\n\n\"As a transgender person in this country \u2026 this fight for our freedom, our recognition, our ability to just live our lives, this isn't new,\" says Westley Ebling, who identifies as a transmasculine nonbinary person who faced issues getting a new passport recently. \"But this scale of attacks is just horrid. It has been a really hard time, to just feel that a country is so against you just for trying to live.\" Passport applications thrown into disarray\nAbout a week after Trump signed the order, Secretary of State Marco Rubio suspended  passport applications of Americans who chose X as their gender or who were trying to update their document's gender marker. Now, under new policies, the State Department will only issue passports that say male or female and that match the applicant's sex at birth. The State Department did not respond to NPR's questions about the new policies and their enforcement. NPR spoke to LGBTQ+ advocates as well as seven people who identify as trans, nonbinary or intersex who have been directly impacted by the changed passport policy or who have put plans to apply for a new passport and to travel on hold as a result of the confusing new rules.\n\nIn Louie's case, he received a new passport with the correct name change. But the gender marker was still \"female,\" like his old passport. Louie says he wasn't surprised, given the State Department's policy changes, but is still upset and frustrated and unsure what it means for him. (Euphoria actress Hunter Schafer shared on TikTok that she also received a new passport that reflected her sex assigned at birth, not her current gender marker, which is on her other documents.)\n\nLouie is now rethinking his international travel destinations and is concerned about how even interactions in the U.S. with law enforcement, for example, could become a problem when his passport lists one gender and his other legal documents another.\n\nTrump's passport policy already faces at least one federal lawsuit by the American Civil Liberties Union. It argues that the executive order and passport policy are unlawful, unconstitutional and \"unmoored from scientific and medical reality.\"\n\nThe American Medical Association supports policies \"that allow for a sex designation or change of designation on all government IDs to reflect an individual's gender identity, as reported by the individual.\" Designating sex as either male or female only fails to factor in \"the medical spectrum of gender identity,\" risks stifling an individuals' self-expression and contributes to marginalization, the organization says. What were the old passport policies?\nThe ability for people to change the sex field on their passports from male to female or vice versa has been allowed since 2010, including through the first Trump administration. To qualify for that change, a doctor had to certify that the applicant was being treated for gender transition. In 2021, the State Department allowed people to make those changes without doctor certification and permitted applicants to select a third gender option, X, on their passport \u2014 after years of litigation. Thousands of gender X passports are believed to be in circulation now, but the State Department has not given a specific number.\n\nMany countries such as Canada, Australia, India and New Zealand allow the \"X\" designation on their passports. Dozens of states already allow residents to update their driver's licenses to reflect their gender identity, with \"X\" being a gender marker option in 22 states and the District of Columbia. At least 16 states and D.C. allow an X gender marker option for updated birth certificates.\n\nWith the new passport policy in place, legal and advocacy groups say they are hearing from people like Louie who have received passports with the wrong gender markers and some whose passports and other legal documents are being held by the State Department.\n\nPassports withheld, questions unanswered\nAll of these issues have left people like Westley Ebling with passport applications in a state of limbo, with no word from the State Department, and important documents, like old passports and birth certificates, withheld.\n\nEbling, a 26-year-old in Washington, D.C., submitted his passport renewal application with a gender marker change from female to male on Jan. 15. The application was received on Jan. 22, shortly after Trump issued his executive order.\n\nEbling wondered what this would mean for him, and when he contacted the office of his congressional representative, Democratic Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton, he was told passport applications with gender changes were being suspended indefinitely.\n\n\"That's all the information I have,\" Ebling says. So for now, he doesn't have a new passport and his old one hasn't been returned. He and his partner have put travel plans on hold, he says.\n\nIntersex Americans face particular challenges\nThe policy changes are having a profound impact on intersex people \u2014 those born with genitalia, chromosomes or reproductive organs that don't fit typical definitions for males or females \u2014 says Erika Lorshbough, the executive director of interACT, a nonprofit that advocates for the legal and civil rights of people with intersex traits.\n\nUnder Trump's Jan. 20 executive order \u2014 titled \"Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government\" \u2014 the federal government now views \"female\" as meaning \"a person belonging, at conception, to the sex that produces the large reproductive cell\" and male as \"a person belonging, at conception, to the sex that produces the small reproductive cell.\"\n\nIntersex people, by definition, cannot fall into these categories, Lorshbough says.\n\n\"For folks in the intersex community, visibility has always been an issue. Every time you're trying to define sex in these perfectly binary terms, you're going to impact intersex people who, by definition, don't present with perfectly binary sex,\" Lorshbough says.\n\nSome intersex people are assigned a sex at birth that doesn't match their development later in life, Lorshbough says. The addition of the X gender marker as an option on official documents helped intersex people feel better represented, she says.\n\nSo, what happens to intersex people looking to get or update a passport now?\n\nIt's unclear for Jennifer Sensiba, who lives in New Mexico. Sensiba, 40, is intersex and was assigned male at birth.\n\n\"It became obvious when I was a teenager and young adult that I wasn't actually male. This was fine by me, because I never felt right in a male gender role,\" Sensiba wrote in an email to NPR. \"I was often mistaken for a transgender man, and was sometimes accused of being a woman pretending to be a man in those days.\"\n\nSensiba eventually changed how she identifies, changed her name legally and updated her gender marker on her driver's license and other IDs. But her birth certificate is still unchanged, so she has \"mixed paperwork,\" as she calls it. As a young adult, Sensiba had a passport under her old name, but it has long since expired. She'd have to apply all over again for a new passport.\n\n\"From what I've been reading, if there's any discrepancy in paperwork, they go with the birth certificate,\" she said.\n\nShe's tried to get answers from her local congressman, but has heard nothing. The fact that these policy decisions have pulled her and other intersex people in a black hole, shows the federal government is \"trying to regulate an issue that they know nothing about,\" she says. Despite the chaos, uncertainty and fear people are feeling in the face of these changes, many say they will continue to live their lives as they have for years.\n\n\"These laws, executive orders, attempts to legislate trans people out of existence won't work,\" Louie, from New York, says. \"We've won our rights over decades and we've existed before we were legally recognized by the state and we will continue to do so regardless of that.\"",

Rowling, who posted a photo of herself enjoying a cigar and drink on X with the caption \u201cI love it when a plan comes together\u201d after reportedly donating over \u00a370,000 to For Women Scotland, the anti-trans organization that had brought the Supreme Court case forward. Yet other U.K. celebrities, like Coughlan, have wasted no time publicly reaffirming their support for the trans community in the ruling\u2019s aftermath.\n\nOn April 17, Coughlan took to Instagram to announce that she was launching a fundraiser for Not A Phase, a trans charity that aims to improve the lives of trans adults across the U.K. \u201cthrough awareness campaigning, social projects, and funding trans+ lead initiatives,\u201d per the organization\u2019s official website. The actress originally set a fundraising goal of \u00a310,000 and pledged to match donations up to that amount.\n\n\u201cTo see an already-marginalized community\u2026 be further attacked in law is really stomach turning and disgusting, and these people celebrating it [are] more stomach turning and disgusting,\u201d Coughlan said in a video. \u201cIf you are a cisgender person who is an ally of a trans person, I think now is the time to just\u2026 speak up and make your voice heard, and let your trans, nonbinary friends and just the community at large know that you\u2019re there for them and will keep fighting for them.\u201d\n\n\nJust an hour after launching the fundraiser, Coughlan shared on her Instagram Story that fans had already met her \u00a310,000 target. In just over 24 hours, the fundraiser has raised well over \u00a370,000 at the time of writing. She has since set a new fundraising goal of \u00a379,699.21 (roughly $105,725).\n\nCoughlan isn\u2019t the only cis U.K. celebrity who\u2019s spoken out on behalf of trans rights following the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling. On April 17, The White Lotus star Aimee Lou Wood re-shared a post from LGBTQ+ activist Ellen Jones to her Instagram Story denouncing the ruling.\n\n\u201cPure rage,\u201d Wood captioned her story. \u201cThis country is a hell hole.\u201d\n\nCoughlan\u2019s Bridgerton co-star, Charitha Chandran, also called out the ruling in an April 17 TikTok that has received over 2.3 million likes.\n\n\u201cHow pathetic to target one of the most oppressed groups in our society,\u201d Chandran said. \u201cHonestly? Loser behavior\u2026 You don\u2019t care about women. You just want to target those who are already oppressed.\u201d",

    "full_text": "CMS tells states Medicaid funds cannot be used for gender-affirming care The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) is urging states to not use Medicaid funds for gender-affirming care for minors, specifically gender reassignment surgeries or hormone treatments.  \n\n\u201cAs a doctor and now CMS Administrator, my top priority is protecting children and upholding the law,\u201d Mehmet Oz, the recently confirmed agency head, said in a statement Friday.  \u201cMedicaid dollars are not to be used for gender reassignment surgeries or hormone treatments in minors\u2014procedures that can cause permanent, irreversible harm, including sterilization,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe have a duty to ensure medical care is lawful, necessary, and truly in the best interests of patients.\u201d \n\nThe CMS sent a letter to state Medicaid agencies Friday notifying them of their responsibility to make sure program payments are \u201cconsistent with quality of care\u201d and that covered services are in the best interest of the patient.  \n\nThe letter, signed by CMS Deputy Administrator and Director Drew Snyder, claims both surgery and hormone treatments lack evidence to support that they offer long-term benefits for transgender minors and that these interventions can cause \u201clong-term and irreparable harm.\u201d It adds that some developed countries like the United Kingdom, Sweden and Finland have issued restrictions on the use of puberty blockers and hormone treatments on children.  \n\nHowever, every major medical association in the U.S. supports gender-affirming care, including gender reassignment surgery and hormone treatments, for transgender adults and minors. The American Medical Association also supports public and private health insurance coverage for the gender-affirming care to treat gender dysphoria and opposes the \u201cdenial of health insurance based on sexual orientation or gender identity.\u201d  At least 10 states \u2014 Kentucky, Arizona, Idaho, Missouri, Florida, Nebraska, Ohio, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas \u2014 have introduced legislation to prohibit Medicaid coverage of gender-affirming care for adults and minors, according to nonprofit think tank the Movement Advancement Project.

    "full_text": "Trump Accountability Tracker255 attacks ON LGBTQ PEOPLE 2025\n04.15.2025  Sent a memo to lawmakers requesting that Congress rescind $1.1 billion in federal funding from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which contributes money to NPR and PBS. The funding is already appropriated by Congress. Public broadcasters like NPR and PBS have a track record of airing programming that highlights LGBTQ stories, issues, and communities,  providing representation and education often not found on commercial networks. The White House memo advocating for the cuts specifically criticized PBS for airing programs featuring transgender characters.\n\n04.04.2025  Issued a proclamation recognizing National Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month that erroneously claims that assaults by undocumented immigrants are one of the leading causes of sexual violence. In fact, eight out of 10 rapes are committed by someone known to the victim, according to data from the Department of Justice. Previous proclamations emphasized support for survivors and perpetrator accountability. Trump was found liable for sexual abuse in 2023. \n\n04.04.2025  Created a new Title IX Special Investigations Team focused on preventing transgender women and girls from women\u2019s and girls\u2019 sports teams and restrooms. The Departments of Education and Justice jointly said that this team will \u201cprotect students, and especially female athletes, from the pernicious effects of gender ideology in school programs and activities.\u201d Title IX was enacted by Congress in 1972 to protect students from discrimination \u201con the basis of sex.\u201d NCAA President Charlie Baker testified in December 2024 that he knows of fewer than ten transgender college student athletes among 510,000 athletes total.\n\n04.04.2025  Targeted transgender people and health care in a proclamation declaring April National Child Abuse Prevention Month. The proclamation is defamatory and without basis and betrays the month\u2019s purpose. Trump\u2019s proclamation singled out transgender care, and without basis, called it a form of child abuse. The proclamation does not address the most common risk factors for neglected or abused children.Transgender people exist, and every major medical association and leading world health authority supports health care for transgender people and youth.   \n\n03.24.2025  Announced attempt to terminate at least 68 grants to 46 institutions, many of which were for research on the health of LGBTQ people. The grants totaled nearly $40 million when awarded and are funded through Congressional budget appropriation, which the executive branch does not control. Most were in some way related to LGBTQ health, including research on HIV prevention. Other canceled studies centered on cancer, youth suicide, and bone health. The AP reports that, \u201cOne canceled project at Vanderbilt University had been following the overall health of more than 1,200 LGBTQ people age 50 and older.\u2026 \u2018We now no longer have anywhere studying LGBT cancer in the United States,\u2019\u201d a researcher noted.\n\n03.15.2025 Shut down the 83-year-old Voice of America (VOA) asserting that the venerable international broadcasting state media network had distributed \u201cradical propaganda,\u201d citing a March 2019 segment about transgender migrants seeking asylum in the United States. The Washington Post\u2018s fact checker described this as an \u201cordinary news story\u201d that was produced during the first Trump administration. The Trump administration has shut down VOA and other U.S.-funded media by placing nearly all staff on administrative leave and terminating contracts with affiliated broadcasters, effectively silencing operations that had promoted democracy globally for decades.\n\n03.07.2025 Signed an executive order directing administration officials to modify the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program to exclude nonprofit organizations engaged in activities he baselessly described as having a \u201csubstantial illegal purpose.\u201d The order to limit the program is aimed at organizations supporting immigrants, diversity initiatives, or transgender care for youth.\n\n03.07.2025 The Department of Defense is reportedly flagging content for removal via keyword search including \u201cgay,\u201d meaning references to the Enola Gay, an airplane that dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima, Japan, would be scrubbed. The AP reports the \u201cvast majority of the Pentagon purge targets women and minorities, including notable milestones made in the military. And it also removes a large number of posts that mention various commemorative months\u2014such as those for Black and Hispanic people and women.\u201d Additional content flagged includes a photo of an Army Corps of Engineer that had an engineer with the last name Gay, and a photo of Army Corps biologists \u201cseemingly because it mentioned they were recording data about fish\u2014including their weight, size, hatchery and gender.\u201d\n\n03.04.2025 Falsely claimed in his Address to Congress that he \u201cbrought back free speech in America.\u201d In fact, his administration has aggressively censored LGBTQ people and identities in executive orders, from federal websites, in health care, and from the Stonewall National Monument website. \n\n03.04.2025 Made the dangerous and misleading claim that $8 million in taxpayer dollars were going towards creating \u201ctransgender mice.\u201d In fact, this baseless claim comes from a far-right watchdog group. Transgenic mice are lab research mice that have been genetically altered to better model human disease response. They have been called a \u201crevolutionary research resource\u201d for medical advancements in asthma and cancer among other areas. \n\n03.04.2025 Falsely claimed the USA was giving \u201c$8 million to promote LGBTQI+ in the African nation of Lesotho, which nobody has ever heard of.\u201d In fact, the U.S. government does not support LGBTQ initiatives in Lesotho, but it does promote widely used health programs, particularly HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment. Trump has previously disparaged African countries and Haiti.\n\n03.04.2025 Touted his executive orders banning transgender women from sports and cited anti-transgender advocate Payton McNabb, a former volleyball player injured during a match against an alleged trans player. In fact, more than 214,000 female student athletes have been injured playing volleyball since 2012, with the vast majority of accidents involving cisgender players.\n\n03.06.2025 Marked Women\u2019s History Month with a proclamation from the U.S. Embassy in Romania. The proclamation cited Trump administration policies that impinge on the right of some people to have passports that accurately reflect their gender identities, to restrict some women from participating in sports, and to seek to define \u201csex\u201d in a way that excludes transgender women from the protections of civil rights laws. Trump\u2019s own history with women includes nominating the Supreme Court justices who helped overturn the federal protections of Roe, and a jury found Trump liable for sexually abusing E. Jean Carroll in 1996, awarding her $5 million. In a leaked 2005 Access Hollywood tape, Trump was recorded bragging about kissing and groping women without their consent. Trump defended several political allies accused of sexual misconduct or domestic abuse, including his first nominee for Attorney General Matt Gaetz, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., and Education Secretary Linda McMahon who is accused of enabling child sex assault when she led the WWE. More than 40 women have publicly accused Trump of various forms of sexual misconduct since the 1970s.\n\n02.19.2025 Rolled out a new HHS webpage, titled \u201cProtecting Women and Children,\u201d that employs Trump\u2019s narrow and scientifically baseless definition of sex and asserts that gender-affirming care is a form of child abuse. The department is promoting a rigid definition of sex that excludes transgender identities, falsely framing gender-affirming care as \u201cchemical and surgical mutilation\u201d and targeting trans inclusion in sports. In fact, every major medical association and leading world health authority supports health care for transgender people and youth. The site section titled \u201cKeeping Men Out of Women\u2019s Sports,\u201d repeats far-right rhetoric used to justify bans on transgender women athletes. \n\n02.18.2025 Added a baseless disclaimer to the top of government websites for the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control, and the Health and Human Services after a federal judge ordered that web pages that contained vital information about trans people and other marginalized groups be reinstated. The pages were posted again with a false header that reads, \u201cAny information on this page promoting gender ideology is extremely inaccurate and disconnected from the immutable biological reality that there are two sexes, male and female\u2026 The Trump Administration rejects gender ideology and condemns the harms it causes to children, by promoting their chemical and surgical mutilation, and to women, by depriving them of their dignity, safety, well-being, and opportunities. This page does not reflect biological reality and therefore the Administration and this Department reject it.\u201d The statement is false and contradicts global medical standards defining gender and sex. Transgender people exist. Every major medical association and leading world health authority supports health care for transgender people and youth.  \n\n02.14.2025 National Park Service removes the word \u201ctransgender\u201d from the Stonewall National Monument website. Transgender people were central in the Stonewall Riots and remain essential in the past, present and future of the LGBTQ movement.\n\n02.10.2025 Signed an executive order to target mainstream essential health care for transgender youth, using inaccurate and inflammatory graphic language. The care is supported by every major medical association and has been prescribed for decades, including throughout the first Trump administration. The order was blocked by a federal judge and prohibits federal agencies from conditioning or withholding federal funding based on the fact that a healthcare entity or professional provides gender-affirming medical care to a patient under nineteen.\n\n02.10.2025 Removed \u201cT\u201d from State Department travel advisory website which now only offers guidance for \u201cLGB\u201d travelers.\n\n02.07.2025 Department of Justice directs federally-funded nonprofit organizations including the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) to remove references to transgender people from public materials. The Verge reported that three reports previously on the NCMEC website had become inaccessible, each of which mentioned LGBTQ people. LGBTQ youth are among the most vulnerable to housing insecurity, violence, and abuse.\n\n02.04.2025 Paused foreign development assistance, including HIV drug supply to USAID-supported countries. Marco Rubio, as Secretary of State, has been put in charge of USAID while Pete Marocco, a Trump appointee, manages the defunding and dismantling of USAID programs. USAID supported HIV treatment and prevention programs, including PEPFAR, which provided lifesaving treatment to millions of people in 54 countries. In addition to HIV programs, USAID supported the rights of LGBTQ people in Dominican Republic, Uganda, Bangladesh, Kosovo, and Guatemala, and worked with LGBTQ populations across Central Asia, the Middle East, and North Africa.\n\n02.04.2025 Froze applications for the gender-neutral \u201cX\u201d marker on U.S. passports. The option had been added in 2021 by the Biden administration. Several countries worldwide already offer options other than male and female on official documents. India, Pakistan and Nepal already have a nonbinary option, and  the Netherlands issued its first gender-neutral passport in 2018.\n\n02.02.2025 Directed schools to stop using federal funding for purposes related to \u201cgender ideology.\u201d Transgender people are real, and not an ideology. More here on the origins of the phrase used to dehumanize trans people.\n\n01.27.2025 Signed an executive order directing the Secretary of Defense to reinstate a ban on transgender people serving in the military. This policy prohibits transgender people from enlisting, bars currently serving transgender personnel from transitioning, and ends the use of authentic pronouns. The order revokes Biden\u2019s policies that had allowed transgender troops to serve openly and access transition-related medical care and reversed protections for LGBTQ people in military service, education, housing, and federal employment.\n\n01.23.2025 Moved some transgender women in prisons to administrative isolation and mandated that transgender women prisoners be detained in men\u2019s prisons. \n\n01.23.2025 Falsely claimed, among multiple baseless claims and wild exaggerations in a speech to global leaders at the World Economic Forum, that \u201cthere are only two genders, male and female. And we will have no men participating in women\u2019s sports and transgender operations, which became the rage, will occur very rarely.\u201d Facts: Science and medicine as well as cultures throughout history have long acknowledged wider diversity of gender. Transgender women are women, and sometimes play sports. \u201cTransgender operations\u201d are already quite rare.\n\n01.20.2025 Signed an executive order revoking multiple Biden-era policies. This order revoked an executive order that addressed discrimination based on gender identity or sexual orientation. \n\n01.20.2025 Ordered an end to Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) programs across the federal government, putting such staff on immediate administrative leave.\n\n01.20.2025 The Trump administration has eliminated nearly all LGBTQ and HIV focused content and resources from the White House website, as well as eliminated LGBTQ and HIV content from key federal agency webpages. Mentions of \u201clesbian,\u201d \u201cbisexual,\u201d \u201cgay,\u201d \u201ctransgender,\u201d \u201csexual orientation,\u201d \u201cgender identity,\u201d and related terms are no longer accessible on WhiteHouse.gov, and the search term \u201cLGBTQ\u201d now brings up zero results on the site. In addition, some LGBTQ-specific pages have been taken down from the Centers for Disease Control, Department of State, and more. \n\n01.20.2025 Signed an executive order declaring that the federal government would recognize only two immutable sexes: male and female. The order aims to  prevent taxpayer funds from being used for gender-transition health care and add \u201cprivacy in intimate spaces\u201d in facilities such as prisons, migrant shelters and rape shelters. In fact, the development of the human body is a complex process, and sex is not solely determined by anatomy, nor is it strictly binary. As many as 1.7% of people are born with an intersex trait.\n\n2024\n10.28.2024 Repeatedly referred to CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper as \u201cAllison\u201d at a rally in Michigan when Cooper\u2019s town hall with Vice President Kamala Harris came up. The anti-LGBTQ and misogynistic rhetoric evokes the trope of gay men as effeminate, suggesting that gay men are women and that being a woman is degrading.\n\n10.13.2024 Aired a anti-transgender campaign ad that pictured Vice President Kamala Harris superimposed with transgender members of the Biden administration and a scene lifted from the television show Orange Is the New Black of inmates in prison jumpsuits. \u201cKamala supports taxpayer funded sex changes for prisoners and illegal aliens. Kamala is for they/them. President Trump is for you.\u201d The assertion echoes a statement Trump made in the presidential debate with Harris: \u201cNow she wants to do transgender operations on illegal aliens that are in prison.\u201d In fact, by law the government must provide medical care to prisoners and immigrant detainees. During Trump\u2019s presidency, officials at the Bureau of Prisons, which operates under the Justice Department, facilitated transgender health care for a limited number of incarcerated individuals who sought such care. This policy was implemented throughout Trump\u2019s four-year term, despite his administration\u2019s public stance on transgender issues.\n\n09.10.24. In the presidential debate Trump said, \u201cNow [Kamala Harris] wants to do transgender operations on illegal aliens that are in prison.\u201d In fact, by law the government must provide medical care to prisoners and immigrant detainees. During Trump\u2019s presidency, officials at the Bureau of Prisons, which operates under the Justice Department, facilitated transgender health care for a limited number of incarcerated people who sought such care. This policy was implemented during Trump\u2019s term.\n\n09.04.2024 Lied about access to gender-affirming care for minors, saying at a Moms for Liberty summit, \u201cThink of it, your kid goes to school and comes home a few days later with an operation\u2026.The school decides what\u2019s going to happen with your child.\u201d The statement is a false, gross misrepresentation of the highly regulated process of transgender health care for minors in the United States. No children are going to school and receiving surgery there for gender dysphoria.\n\n08.02.2024 In an interview at The National Association of Black Journalists conference he falsely questioned Vice President Kamala Harris\u2018 racial identity, claiming she \u201chappened to turn Black\u201d a few years ago and suggesting she previously only promoted her Indian heritage. The lie echos his previous racist remarks, such as the \u201cbirther\u201d conspiracy theories he promoted against former President Barack Obama.\n\n07.18.2024 During 90-minute nomination acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention, he repeats baseless disinformation about transgender women and girls participating in sports. GLAAD\u2019s Voter Poll shows a majority of voters in all parties oppose \u201ca political candidate [who] speaks frequently about restricting access to health care and participation in sports for transgender youth.\u201d\n\n07.10.2024  Campaign website includes formal policy plans called \u201cAgenda 47\u201d that includes a pledge titled \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s Plan to Protect Children From Left-Wing Gender Insanity.\u201d The Advocate reports, \u201cTrump promised to outlaw gender-affirming care for minors at the federal level, and \u2018cease all programs that promote the concept of sex and gender transition at any age.\u2019 He also promised to ban transgender athletes from competing on teams that match their gender identity.\u2026 Trump stated that he \u2018will ask Congress to pass a bill establishing that the only genders recognized by the United States government are male and female \u2014 and they are assigned at birth.\u2019 He then claimed that being transgender was \u2018invented\u2019 by the \u2018radical left,\u2019 though he did not use the term \u2018transgender\u2019 once throughout Agenda 47.\u201d\n\n06.21.24  Announced that if elected for a second term, he would cut federal funding for inclusive schools: \u201cOn day one, I will sign a new executive order to cut Federal funding of any school pushing critical race theory, transgender insanity, and other inappropriate racial, sexual, or political content onto the lives of our children.\u201d He also announced his intent to target transgender people in sports.\n\n05.17.2024 Recommitted to criminalizing abortion, telling Time that he would not intervene in decisions to monitor or prosecute pregnant people. He refused to say whether his second administration would enforce the Comstock Act, an 1873 \u201czombie law\u201d that bans the mailing of \u201cobscene\u201d materials, including birth control and \u201cinstruments\u201d used for abortions. The act has been unenforceable for the past 50 or so years, largely because it was rendered unconstitutional by Roe v. Wade, which Trump has repeatedly taken credit for overturning.\n\n05.14.2024 Vowed to roll back Title IX protections for transgender student enacted in April 2024 by the U.S. Department of Education \u201con day one,\u201d if he\u2019s reelected. Trump said: \u201cWe\u2019re going to end it on day one. Don\u2019t forget, that was done as an order from the president. That came down as an executive order. And we\u2019re going to change it\u2014on day one it\u2019s going to be changed\u2026. It\u2019ll be terminated.\u201d\n\n04.08.2024 Stated his current position on abortion on his social media platform in a video saying, \u201cMy view is now that we have abortion where everyone wanted it from a legal standpoint, the states will determine by vote or legislation, or perhaps both. And whatever they decide must be the law of the land. In this case, the law of the state.\u201d In the same video he made the baseless claim that Democrats want to legalize the \u201cexecution\u201d of babies that were already born, which is not true. Trump\u2019s position on abortion rights has changed many times from saying he is \u201cvery pro-choice\u201d in 1999, to personally taking credit for overturning Roe vs. Wade in 2022, to saying Florida\u2019s six-week abortion ban is \u201ca terrible mistake\u201d in 2023, to saying he would \u201cbe open\u201d to a 15 week ban in 2024.\n\n04.04.2024 Announced he would declare November 5 to be \u201cChristian Visibility Day\u201d after a baseless complaint about Transgender Day of Visibility coinciding with Easter in 2024. Previously Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt issued a statement calling it \u201cappalling and insulting\u201d that Biden \u201cformally proclaimed Easter Sunday as \u2018Trans Day of Visibility.\u2019 \u201d\n\n03.16.2024 Defended Ohio Senate primary candidate Bernie Moreno, whose email address was used to create an account on Adult Friend Finder in 2008 seeking \u201cmen for 1-on-1 sex.\u201d Moreno\u2019s campaign said the account was created by an intern as a prank. Trump defended Moreno and claimed \u201cDemocratic fake treatment\u201d for the story Moreno\u2019s campaign had confirmed: \u201cWe all know this man. He\u2019s a hero, he\u2019s a winner and we\u2019re not going to let these people \u2014 these people are sick.\u201d\n\n03.16.2024 Appeared at a campaign rally for Ohio Senate primary candidate Bernie Moreno, sponsored by the pro-Moreno Buckeye Values PAC. The PAC released an ad targeting a Moreno rival as \u201ca champion for trans equality.\u201d The PAC also reportedly sent campaign mail asking \u201cWhat Team Does Frank LaRose Play For?\u201d and \u201cIs he with us \u2026 Or is he with they/them?\u201d\n\n03.04.2024 Endorsed North Carolina Lt. Governor Mark Robinson for governor, despite Robinson\u2019s history of anti-LGBTQ disinformation and rhetoric, including calling gay people \u201cfilth\u201d and \u201cmaggots.\u201d Trump repeated his past claims that Robinson is \u201cbetter than Martin Luther King\u201d and \u201cMartin Luther King on steroids.\u201d \n\n02.02.2024 Used vulgar slang to refer to LGBTQ legal icon Roberta Kaplan, who represented E. Jean Carroll against Trump. Trump was found liable for sexually abusing Carroll in the 1990s and for defaming her by mocking her claims after he left the White House. A jury awarded Carroll with $83 million in damages. Kaplan recalled leading the deposition of Trump, saying that at the end Trump\u2019s lawyers asked to go \u201coff the record,\u201d meaning what he said would not be included on the court deposition transcript. Kaplan said Trump then said to her: \u201cSee you next Tuesday,\u201d a slang term referring to a word for female genitalia used as an insult for women.\n\n02.20.2024 Supported by the anti-LGBTQ national organization Heritage Foundation with a 180-page document detailing regulations and executive orders to be taken in first days in office, including: \u201cdeleting [from federal agencies and federal rule] the terms sexual orientation and gender identity (\u201cSOGI\u201d), diversity, equity, and inclusion., gender, gender equality, gender equity, gender awareness, gender-sensitive, abortion, reproductive health, reproductive rights;\u201d limiting abortion access with executive orders using the Comstock Act \u2014 a long-inactive 19th century law that banned birth control and abortion medication by mail. Semafor reported: While Project 2025 bills itself as being \u201ccandidate agnostic,\u201d [project director Paul] Dans noted that at this point in the primary, they expect \u201cand hope\u201d that Donald Trump will ultimately end up in office again. NBC News reported that Project 2025 includes representatives from anti-LGBTQ, anti-equality and anti-democracy groups \u201cled by veterans of the Trump administration, such as America First Legal, the Center for Renewing America and the Conservative Partnership Institute, the Claremont Institute, the Family Research Council and the Independent Women\u2019s Forum.\u201d (Links to groups added by GLAAD).\n\n01.10.2024 Boasted of his role in the Supreme Court decision ending the right to abortion by nominating three of the justices who joined the decision: \u201cIf it weren\u2019t for me, with Roe v. Wade, you wouldn\u2019t even be talking about this stuff. For 54 years they were trying to get Roe v. Wade terminated, and I did it and I\u2019m proud to have done it,\u201d Trump said. Abortion is an LGBTQ issue: LGBTQ people can and do get pregnant, lesbian young women are two to ten times more likely to become pregnant than heterosexual youth, lesbian and bisexual women are often at higher risk of sexual assault due in part to their sexual orientation, which may also result in an unplanned pregnancy. \n\n2023\n12.30.2023 Criticized Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine for vetoing state bill banning essential health care for transgender youth and banning trans youth from school sports, spread disinformation about the care and school sports. DeWine had said his veto was based on conversations he had with parents, patients and providers who told him how the care saves lives. Trump said in a Truth Social post: \u201cDeWine has fallen to the Radical Left\u2026 What was he thinking. The bill would have stopped child mutilation, and prevented men from playing in women\u2019s sports. Legislature will hopefully overturn. Do it FAST!!!\u201d Ohio hospitals and providers, along with hundreds of others, had testified that they do not perform surgeries on youth, and Ohio\u2019s school sports association has long had policies to ensure inclusive participation of transgender students.\n\n12.17.2023 Announced on social media, \u201cOn Day One [of a second term if he were reelected President], I will sign a new executive order to cut federal funding for any school pushing Critical Race Theory, transgender insanity, and other inappropriate racial, sexual, or political content on our children\u2026\u201d\n\n11.03.2023 Mimicked a Canadian weightlifter in an extended campaign event skit to mock and misgender transgender women in sports, claiming he will \u201cend this on day one\u201d if he\u2019s re-elected.\n\n09.13.2023 In \u201cAgenda47: President Trump\u2019s Ten Principles For Great Schools Leading To Great Jobs\u201d on Trump\u2019s campaign web site, he disparaged transgender people and includes misinformation about gender in eight of the ten principles. The Agenda targets LGBTQ people, particularly transgender people, by opposing gender-affirming care, restricting teachers from supporting transgender students, defining gender strictly as binary and assigned at birth, and eliminating LGBTQ-inclusive curricula. These policies aim to remove recognition and support for transgender identities in education and healthcare while promoting a restrictive view of gender and sexuality.\n\n05.17.2023 Proudly stated, \u201cI was able to kill Roe v. Wade,\u201d taking credit for the Supreme Court overturning the national right to an abortion in the Dobbs decision. The Dobbs decision suggested that the right to same-sex marriage should be reconsidered by the Court as well. \n\n06.11.2023 Said of transgender athletes at a rally, \u201cWho would even think that you can allow this? Who would say that this is okay? These people are sick. They are deranged\u2026. It\u2019s astonishing how passionately people react to that. When you talk about tax cuts, they remain calm. But when you mention transgender issues, everyone goes wild. Who would have imagined five years ago that they wouldn\u2019t even know what \u2018it\u2019 meant?\u201d\n\n04.14.2023 Said that if re-elected, he would use the government to investigate and potentially halt transgender health care during a National Rifle Association (NRA) speech. \u201cUpon my inauguration, I will direct the FDA to convene an independent outside panel to investigate whether transgender hormone treatments and ideology increase the risk of extreme depression, aggression and even violence,\u201d said Trump. He also accused Democrats of \u201cpushing the transgender cult\u201d on children.\n\n03.26.2023 Vowed to crack down on \u201ctransgender insanity\u201d and pledged to \u201crevoke every Biden policy promoting the disfigurement of our youth\u201d at the first rally of his 2024 presidential campaign. He said that he would \u201ckeep men out of women\u2019s sports\u201d if re-elected president, after he last year misgendered transgender athlete Lia Thomas. He added: \u201cI will immediately sign an executive order to cut federal funding for any school pushing critical race theory, transgender insanity, and other racial, sexual or political content on our children.\u201d\n\n01.31.2023 Made multiple false claims about gender affirming care, tweeting a so-called \u201cPlan to Protect Children from Left-Wing Gender Insanity.\u201c Every major medical association and world health authority supports gender affirming care; statements here including from the American Academy of Pediatrics: \u201cThere is strong consensus among the most prominent medical organizations worldwide that evidence-based, gender-affirming care for transgender children and adolescents is medically necessary and appropriate. It can even be lifesaving. The decision of whether and when to start gender-affirming treatment, which does not necessarily lead to hormone therapy or surgery, is personal and involves careful consideration by each patient and their family.\u201d\n\n01.29.2023 At a campaign event, falsely claimed and without evidence or fact: \u201cWe\u2019re going to stop the left-wing radical racists and perverts who are trying to indoctrinate our youth, and we\u2019re going to get their Marxist hands off our children\u2026We\u2019re going to defeat the cult of gender ideology and reaffirm that God created two genders: men and women. We\u2019re not going to allow men to play women\u2019s sports.\u201d\n\n01.26.2023 Released so-called education policy that cuts federal funding for any school or program that includes \u201ccritical race theory, gender ideology, or other inappropriate racial, sexual, or political content onto our children.\u201d",

    "full_text": "Fact Sheet: Misleading Narratives About Transgender People and Restrooms, Locker Rooms, and Other Single-Sex Spaces Current proposals in the US that prohibit transgender people from being able to use public restrooms that align with who they are (e.g. proposals forcing transgender men to use women\u2019s bathrooms, and trans women to use the men\u2019s room) are constructed on intentional falsehoods. This trend of inflammatory fearmongering and demonization is a threat to the health and safety of transgender people, as well as cisgender people perceived to be trans. Safety and privacy is important to all of us, and banning transgender people from these spaces does nothing to make other people safer.\n\nThese discriminatory endeavors are part of the broader, escalating wave of attacks on basic civil rights. These attacks include attempts to ban essential health care for transgender youth and adults, restrict participation in sports, block accurate identity documents, curb freedom of expression, endanger transgender inmates by incarcerating them in institutions inconsistent with their gender identity, and suppress and even criminalize books, education, and culture by and about LGBTQ people.\n\nAll of these efforts are part of the same broader goal to roll back the clock on acceptance for transgender people, and make it increasingly difficult for transgender Americans to go about their daily lives.\n\nReporters should include these facts when reporting on these issues:\n\nCurrent legislative and executive branch efforts to restrict transgender people and youth from public restrooms and similar spaces are based more in fearmongering than facts. Research shows no evidence of safety risks for cisgender people when trans people use restrooms aligning with their authentic gender; in fact, transgender people are at elevated risk for harassment and violence in these spaces.\nAccording to the Movement Advancement Project, bathroom bans can result in \u201chigh rates of harassment and violence against transgender people as well as cisgender people, particularly women who do not conform to traditional ideas of femininity.\u201d\nHarming someone in a public restroom is already illegal. Bathroom bans often have no guidance on enforcement, and can result in invasions of privacy for everyone when individual citizens randomly (and often mistakenly) attempt to enforce these vaguely constructed statutes.\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s executive orders inaccurately state that there are only two sexes, ignoring the reality of intersex people and decades of established medical and scientific research about sex and gender diversity throughout history and cultures. That\u2019s why every major medical association and health authority in the world recognizes and supports health care for transgender people. President Trump has attempted to use his orders to impose discriminatory anti-trans bathroom bans for restrooms on federal property. The executive orders do not override the US Constitution, federal statutes, or established legal precedent. Federal judges have already struck down many of his executive orders, while the constitutionality of others continues to be challenged in court.\nImposing discrimination on transgender people at the federal level would be illegal under the Supreme Court\u2019s Bostock decision, which ruled that discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity is unconstitutional sex discrimination.\nPresident Trump\u2019s executive order mandating the transfer of transgender inmates to prisons that do not align with their gender (e.g. putting transgender men in women\u2019s prisons and transgender women in men\u2019s prisons) endangers the safety of trans prisoners, and is also likely unconstitutional. The Supreme Court ruled, in a 1994 case brought by a trans inmate, that it is the government\u2019s duty to protect prisoners from violence. The decision noted the particular vulnerability of trans inmates.\nAs of early March 2025, 600 anti-transgender bills have been introduced nationwide, and nine have passed. In 2024, 674 anti-trans bills were proposed and 50 passed. Of the potential bills in 2025 so far, 44 seek to restrict transgender bathroom access.\nTransgender people should not be unfairly discriminated against and should be allowed to \u201cuse facilities and participate in activities that match who they are,\u201d notes the ACLU. \u201cWe believe it is not only the right answer from a human point of view, but it is also legally required by statutory and constitutional bans on sex discrimination.\u201d\nWhen a bill or proposal explicitly addresses transgender people and the use of restrooms, locker rooms, or other single-sex spaces, journalists should contextualize it with the facts above, speak with transgender people and organizations to include their perspectives, and make note of broadscale patterns of targeting trans people with false, harmful, and dehumanizing narratives in efforts to retract their basic civil rights.\n\nADDITIONAL RESOURCES\n\nGLAAD: Debunking the \u201cBathroom Bill\u201d Myth report explores the harmful effects of bathroom discrimination on transgender people, and debunks misinformation spread by proponents of anti-trans legislation: \u201cOpponents of discrimination protections typically focus on generating fears about bathrooms, falsely claiming that such laws will make it legal for sexual predators to enter women\u2019s restrooms.\u201d\nMovement Advancement Project (MAP): tracks laws and potential legislation. MAP shares this data via an interactive map.\nThe ACLU tracks anti-LGBTQ legislation nationwide and shares data through an interactive map that allows users to sort information by issue, state, and status.\nThe Trans Legislation Tracker monitors legislation attempting to ban transgender people from various public services and facilities.\nHarvard School of Public Health: A 2019 LGBTQ Teen Study, an anonymous survey of more than 3,600 youth ages 13 to 17, revealed that transgender and nonbinary teens face a higher risk of sexual assault when forced to use bathrooms and locker rooms that don\u2019t match their gender identity: \u201c36% of transgender or gender-nonbinary students with restricted bathroom or locker room access reported being sexually assaulted in the last 12 months.\u201d\nMAP/GLSEN: \u201cSingling out transgender students and telling them they must use separate restrooms is humiliating and discriminatory \u2026 forcing transgender students into restrooms that don\u2019t match the gender they live every day puts their safety at even greater risk.\u201d Nearly three-quarters of transgender students (70%) say they have \u201cavoided bathrooms because they felt unsafe or uncomfortable.\u201d\nThe Trevor Project: \u201cTransgender and nonbinary young people who had access to gender-affirming clothing, gender-neutral bathrooms at school, and had their pronouns respected by the people they live with had lower rates of attempting suicide compared to those who did not.\u201d",

    "full_text": "South Dakota governor signs anti-transgender bathroom bill A new law in South Dakota will restrict transgender people\u2019s use of communal facilities in public schools and state-owned buildings starting July 1.\n\nRepublican Gov. Larry Rhoden signed bill HB 1259 into law on Friday, which prohibits transgender people from using changing rooms and restrooms that align with their gender identity. The bill also allows people who encounter transgender people in these facilities to seek declaratory and injunctive relief against the school or state if officials did not take reasonable steps to prevent the transgender person from using that facility.\n\n\u201cSouth Dakota is a place where common-sense values remain common,\u201d Rhoden said in a statement, adding that the bill promotes \u201cfreedom from the \u2018woke\u2019 agenda like what has happened in too many other places.\u201d\n\nThis is the first time South Dakota has had a state law restricting transgender people\u2019s bathroom access, thanks to the overwhelmingly conservative state legislature this session. A bill had previously passed through both chambers of the state legislature in 2016 before it was vetoed by then Gov. Dennis Daugaard. Samantha Chapman, advocacy manager at the ACLU of South Dakota, said the organization is exploring its options against the law.\n\n\u201cThis is a really painful law,\u201d Chapman said. \u201cIt\u2019s really disheartening and kind of heartbreaking, frankly, to see Rhoden take this position and sign this bill into law.\u201d\n\n\nSouth Dakota is at least the 13th state to adopt a law barring transgender girls and women from girls and women\u2019s bathrooms at public schools, and in some cases other government facilities. A similar measure was sent Thursday to the governor in Tennessee; a bill is also on the governor\u2019s desk in Montana.\n\nMost of the bans in other states face court challenges, but those haven\u2019t had final rulings. Courts have struck down some school district-level bathroom bans across the country. But this week, a federal appeals panel ruled 3-0 that a district judge was not wrong to allow Idaho\u2019s ban to be enforced while the case is considered. Since he returned to office in January, President Donald Trump has signed a series of executive orders intended to curtail the rights of transgender people. President Joe Biden\u2019s administration had sought to apply the federal barring of gender discrimination at schools to gender identity, but the courts put the brakes on that.",

The Supreme Court on December 4 will hear oral arguments in a case dealing with Tennessee\u2019s law banning irreversible gender transition procedures for children \u2014 and it promises to be one of the most significant cases the court has looked at this term.\n\nTennessee Gov. Bill Lee (R.) signed the much-discussed Senate Bill 1 into law on March 22, 2023, which went into effect on July 1, 2023. The bill bans doctors or health care providers from performing so-called \u201cgender-affirming\u201d surgeries or hormonal procedures on minors, including surgery, puberty blockers, and hormones.\n\nThe bill followed a September 2022 investigation into Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) by the The Daily Wire\u2019s Matt Walsh, who exposed VUMC\u2019s gender transition procedures for children and shocking attitudes towards gender transitions in general. Walsh and The Daily Wire found that the hospital regarded transgender procedures as a \u201cbig money maker\u201d and pressured employees to ignore their \u201creligious beliefs\u201d on transgender issues or face \u201cconsequences.\u201d\n\nThe Biden administration joined the ACLU and several teenage plaintiffs suing to stop the law, and a Tennessee district court initially blocked it in April 2023. But in September 2023, a sixth circuit court upheld Tennessee\u2019s protections for children. The Supreme Court took up the case in June 2024, combining the Justice Department and ACLU cases into United States v. Skrmetti, marking the first time that the High Court took up a case of this kind.\n\n\u201cThe people of Tennessee, through their elected representatives, took measured action with Senate Bill 1 to protect kids from irreversible, unproven medical procedures,\u201d Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti said in an October statement. \u201cLawmakers recognized that there is little to no credible evidence to justify the serious risks these procedures present to youth and joined a growing number of European countries in restricting their use on minors with gender-identity issues.\u201d\n\nThe ACLU led a variety of left-wing legal groups in suing Tennessee in April 2023 to block the law from going into effect, calling these transgender procedures \u201cmedically necessary gender-affirming care for Tennessee\u2019s transgender youth.\u201d That claim is based on activist assertions that young people suffering from gender dysphoria may commit suicide if they do not have access to transgender hormones or surgeries.\n\nRecent research has shown that, contrary to such claims, these procedures actually increase the likelihood that minors will attempt suicide. According to an April study, \u201cgender-affirming surgery is significantly associated with elevated suicide-attempt risks, underlining the necessity for comprehensive post-procedure psychiatric support.\u201d\n\nYet the ACLU and their allies are suing Tennessee on behalf of a Nashville, Tennessee couple and their 15-year-old son, who identifies as a girl, as well as a doctor from Memphis, Tennessee, Dr. Susan Lacy.\n\n\u201cIt was incredibly painful watching my child struggle before we were able to get her the life-saving healthcare she needed. We have a confident, happy daughter now, who is free to be herself and she is thriving,\u201d the ACLU\u2019s client, Samantha Williams, said earlier this year of her trans-identifying son.\n\n\u201cI am so afraid of what this law will mean for her,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to leave Tennessee, but this legislation would force us to either routinely leave our state to get our daughter the medical care she desperately needs or to uproot our entire lives and leave Tennessee altogether. No family should have to make this kind of choice.\u201d\n\nSkrmetti\u2019s office argues that states have governed the practice of medicine within their borders since the United States was founded, pointing out that it is states who license doctors and regulate medical practices, which includes restricting the administration of drugs. The Tennessee lawmakers who passed Senate Bill 1 used that power to stop the use of hormonal and surgical procedures for minor gender transition procedures, Skrmetti\u2019s office said.\n\nMore than 20 other states have passed similar laws protecting children, they pointed out.\n\n\u201cThe federal government, in its arguments to the Supreme Court, puts its faith in a false and manufactured consensus that ignores the many doctors, States, and countries who have looked at the evidence and determined these treatments are too risky for kids,\u201d Skrmetti added. \u201cThe Constitution does not prevent the States from regulating the practice of medicine where hot-button social issues are concerned. People who disagree with restrictions on irreversible pediatric procedures for gender transition are free to advocate for change through state elections.\u201d\n\nThe ACLU\u2019s case will be argued by Chase Strangio, a woman who identifies as a transgender man. The ACLU has advertised that Strangio will be the first openly trans-identifying individual to argue a case before the Supreme Court, describing Strangio as \u201cour nation\u2019s leading legal expert on the rights of transgender people, bar none.\u201d",

    "full_text": "You Are Not Dreaming: Senate Dems Actually Banded Together to Block an Anti-Trans Sports Ban Senate Democrats voted unanimously on Monday to block a Republican-led bill that would have banned federally funded schools from allowing trans athletes to compete in women\u2019s sports.\n\nThe party line vote was 51-45, with zero Democrats voting in favor. Four senators did not vote: Republican senators Shelley Moore (WV) and Cynthia Lummis (WY) and Democratic senators Elissa Slotkin (MI) and Peter Welch (VT). Although the Republican party has a majority in the Senate with 53 seats, the bill \u2014 deceitfully titled the \u201cProtection of Women and Girls in Sports Act\u201d \u2014 needed seven Democratic votes to reach the 60-vote threshold required for it to advance.\n\nThe Republican-majority House passed their own version of the bill in January with a 218-206 vote. Two House Democrats \u2014 Texas representatives Henry Cuellar and Vincente Gonzalez \u2014 voted in favor of the anti-trans measure, while one Democrat (North Carolina Rep. Donald G. Davis) voted \u201cpresent.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat Republicans are doing today is inventing a problem to stir up a culture war and divide people against each other,\u201d Hawaii Democrat Sen. Brian Schatz said on the floor on Monday, per The Hill.\n\n\u201cI, for one, trust our states, our leagues, our localities to make these decisions [about women\u2019s sports] without interference from Congress or the president,\u201d Wisconsin Democratic Senator Tammy Baldwin said on the floor, per the Washington Post.\n\nThe bill, sponsored in the Senate by Alabama Republican Senator Tommy Tuberville, sought to ban trans girls and women from competing in women\u2019s sports at public K-12 schools and universities by amending Title IX, the federal civil rights law that prohibits sex discrimination in educational institutions. If signed into law, the bill would have changed the statute of Title IX to explicitly exclude transgender people from a federal civil rights law. The bill narrowly and falsely defines sex as \u201cbased solely on a person\u2019s reproductive biology and genetics at birth.\u201d\n\nConversely, the Biden administration\u2019s Title IX regulations allowed LGBTQ+ students to fight discrimination without a lawsuit. Instead, they could file a complaint with the Education Department\u2019s Office of Civil Rights.\n\nThe legislation also would have codified into law Donald Trump\u2019s February executive order derisively titled \u201cKeeping Men Out of Women\u2019s Sports,\u201d which directed federal agencies to withdraw funding from educational programs that allow trans girls to play on teams that align with their gender. Although the executive order doesn\u2019t have the power to immediately ban trans women and girls from sports across the country, the Trump administration has already attempted to use it to intimidate states into bending to the administration\u2019s will. Last week, for instance, the president threatened to cut Maine\u2019s federal funding if state governor Janet Mills did not comply with the order.\n\nAnti-trans fearmongering was a major talking point for Republicans during the 2024 election cycle, particularly when it came to demonizing trans women\u2019s inclusion in sports. An October New York Times analysis of AdImpact data found that Republicans had spent over $65 million on anti-trans campaign ads since the beginning of August and the Trump campaign had spent $15.5 million on anti-trans ads in just three weeks.\n\nDemocrats have come under criticism in recent months, including from this publication, for their responses to right-wing anti-trans attacks. During the last election cycle, for instance, Democratic candidates like Texas Rep. Colin Allred and Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown faced pushback after responding to Republican anti-trans attack ads with anti-trans talking points of their own. Shortly after Trump\u2019s presidential victory in November, Democratic New York Rep. Tom Suozzi told the New York Times that the party must \u201cstop pandering to the far left\u201d on trans rights, sparking outrage from LGBTQ+ advocates. And even as South Carolina Republican Rep. Nancy Mace spent the beginning of 2025 hurling anti-trans slurs at Delaware Rep. Sarah McBride, the first out trans woman to serve in Congress, Democrats have largely remained silent. Suffice it to say, holding the line against Republicans\u2019 latest anti-trans attacks is a nice change of pace.\n\nIris Turmelle, one of the plaintiffs now in high school, told Them in a statement last August that her goal is simply to compete alongside her peers.\n\u201cA whole host of overpaid consultants and talking heads told [Democrats] not to do the right thing, and they still chose to do the right thing, so I\u2019d even go a step further and encourage people to contact Senators who opposed this measure (SB 9) and thank them for standing by trans people and our families,\u201d ACLU communications strategist Gillian Branstetter wrote in a March 3 Bluesky post.\n\nAs many experts and trans athletes have pointed out, athletic ability among trans people varies as much as it does for cis people. Meanwhile, research has found that trans women who undergo testosterone suppression through gender-affirming care have no clear biological advantages over cis women in elite sports. According to an April 2024 study funded in part by the International Olympic Committee, trans women athletes may indeed have several physical disadvantages when competing with cisgender women.\n\nFor all that their existence has been politicized, trans athletes represent a very small percentage of all student-athletes. In December, NCAA President Charlie Baker told a Senate panel that out of the over 510,000 NCAA athletes, fewer than 10 are transgender to his knowledge.",

    "full_text": "Montana Court Blocks State From Refusing to Correct Sex Markers on Transgender People's Birth Certificates and Driver's Licenses A Montana court has granted a preliminary injunction preventing the state of Montana from enforcing policies that bar transgender people from obtaining accurate sex designations on their birth certificates and driver\u2019s licenses.\n\nAfter a prior restriction on amendments of birth certificates was struck down by the courts, in early 2024 the state of Montana enacted a new rule that categorically bars transgender Montanans from correcting the sex designation on their birth certificates. Around the same time, the Montana Department of Justice adopted a policy similarly restricting amendment of driver\u2019s licenses. The plaintiffs challenged these policies in state district court, arguing that they violate various constitutional provisions, including the right to equal protection of the law.\n\nIn a recent Montana Supreme Court decision, two justices concluded that discrimination on the basis of transgender status \u2013 as the state is engaging in here \u2013 is a form of sex discrimination that violates the Montana Constitution\u2019s equal protection clause.\n\nThe plaintiffs, two transgender women, are represented by the American Civil Liberties Union, the ACLU of Montana, and Nixon Peabody LLP.\n\nPlaintiff Jessica Kalarchik, a veteran who served in the United States Army for 31 years, said: \u201cAfter finally being able to live my life openly as the woman I know myself to be, I am frustrated that my birth state, Montana, wants me to carry around a birth certificate that incorrectly lists my sex as male. I live my life openly as a woman, I am treated as a woman in my daily life, and there is no reason I should be forced to carry a birth certificate that incorrectly identifies me as male. Fortunately, the court agrees that this ridiculous policy should not be in effect.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnce again the State of Montana chose to adopt a draconian policy that is clearly intended to marginalize transgender Montanans, only for that discriminatory action to be blocked by the courts,\u201d said Akilah Deernose, executive director for the ACLU of Montana. \u201cHere in Montana we treasure our right to privacy and to live our lives free from governmental intrusion. The State of Montana clearly has not learned any lessons from the past few years, where courts have repeatedly struck down unconstitutional laws targeting transgender Montanans.\u201d\n\n\u201cForcing anyone to carry documents that contradict their identity unjustly violates their rights to privacy, equal treatment, and not being compelled to convey a government message about their sex that they disagree with,\u201d said Malita Picasso, staff attorney for the ACLU\u2019s LGBTQ & HIV Project. \u201cSuch a policy marks transgender people for further mistreatment and discrimination, essentially requiring them to carry papers that out them as transgender any time they need to provide identity documents. Fortunately, the court has refused to allow the state of Montana to subvert the freedom of transgender Montanans to control their own identity as this case goes forward.\u201d\n\nIn granting the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction, the court held, \u201c[i]f the challenged state actions discriminate against transgender individuals on the basis of their transgender status, they also necessarily discriminate the basis of sex.\u201d\n\nThe state has the option of appealing the district court\u2019s ruling to the Montana Supreme Court, but the underlying case will proceed in district court. A trial has not yet been scheduled.",

    "full_text": "Federal judge blocks Trump\u2019s passport policy affecting transgender Americans A federal judge on Friday blocked the Trump administration from enacting a policy that bans the use of \u201cX\u201d marker used by many nonbinary people on passports as well as the changing of gender markers.\n\nIn an executive order signed in January, the president used a narrow definition of the sexes instead of a broader conception of gender. The order says a person is male or female and it rejects the idea that someone can transition from the sex assigned at birth to another gender. The framing is in line with many conservatives\u2019 views but at odds with major medical groups and policies under former President Joe Biden.\n\nREAD MORE: Federal judge blocks Trump ban on transgender people serving in military\n\nU.S. District Judge Julia Kobick, who was appointed by President Joe Biden, sided with the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction, which stays the action while the lawsuit plays out.\n\n\u201cThe Executive Order and the Passport Policy on their face classify passport applicants on the basis of sex and thus must be reviewed under intermediate judicial scrutiny,\u201d Kobick wrote. \u201cThat standard requires the government to demonstrate that its actions are substantially related to an important governmental interest. The government has failed to meet this standard.\u201d\n\nThe ACLU, which sued the Trump administration on behalf of five transgender Americans and two nonbinary plaintiffs, said the new policy would effectively mean transgender, nonbinary and intersex Americans could not get an accurate passport.\n\n\u201cWe all have a right to accurate identity documents, and this policy invites harassment, discrimination, and violence against transgender Americans who can no longer obtain or renew a passport that matches who they are,\u201d ACLU lawyer Sruti Swaminathan said.\n\nIn response to the lawsuit, the Trump administration argued the passport policy change \u201cdoes not violate the equal protection guarantees of the Constitution.\u201d They also contended that the president has broad discretion in setting passport policy and that plaintiffs would not be harmed by the policy, since they are still free to travel abroad.\n\n",

    "full_text": "Trump Checks on Nancy Mace After Alleged Assault by Pro-Trans Activist President-elect Donald Trump checked on Rep. Nancy Mace (R-SC) after a transgender activist allegedly assaulted the congresswoman, leaving her in a wrist brace.\n\n\u201cJust got off the phone with @Realdonaldtrump,\u201d Mace said on Wednesday, the day after the reported assault.\n\n\u201cThank you, Mr. President, for checking in on me and for standing up for women,\u201d she continued. \u201cWe cannot wait to see you back in the White House. #HoldTheLine.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s call to Mace came after she revealed on X that she was \u201cphysically accosted at the Capitol tonight by a pro-tr*ns man.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne new brace for my wrist and some ice for my arm and it\u2019ll heal just fine. The Capitol police arrested the guy. Your tr*ns violence and threats on my life will only make me double down. FAFO,\u201d she said, using her frequently used mantra, \u201cHold the Line.\u201d\n\nU.S. Capitol Police confirmed the incident.\n\n\u201cTonight, the United States Capitol Police (USCP) arrested a person who is accused of assaulting a U.S. Representative,\u201d a Capitol Police spokesperson said.\n\n\u201cJust before 6:00 p.m., the Member of Congress\u2019 office reported an incident in the Rayburn House Office Building. House Division officers, and agents with the Threat Assessment Section, tracked down the suspect,\u201d the spokesperson continued, confirming that the suspect \u2014 identified as 33-year-old James McIntyre of Illinois \u2014 has been arrested.\n\n\u201cMcIntyre is facing a charge for Assaulting a Government Official,\u201d the spokesperson added.\n\nMace has continued to face a wave of hate from the radical left over her insistence that biological men should not use single-sex spaces designated for women, pushing a measure to ensure that only women are using women\u2019s facilities in the U.S. Capitol. That comes as transgender Delaware Rep.-elect Sarah McBride (D) \u2014 a man who believes he is a woman \u2014 is joining the House of Representatives in January.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to allow biological men into women\u2019s private spaces,\u201d Mace said, defending her position.\u201dI will stand in the brink and stand in the way of anyone on the radical left who thinks that it\u2019s ok for a penis to be in a women\u2019s locker room or a bathroom or a changing room. Hell no, I\u2019m not going to stand for it.\u201d\n\nDuring that interview, which occurred prior to Tuesday\u2019s incident, Mace said she had received death threats over her common sense position.\n\n\u201cWhy is it that these crazy people, the insanity, the radical left are willing to kill women over a man\u2019s right to be in a women\u2019s restroom?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cForcing women to share private spaces with men is not dignity and not respect,\u201d she continued. \u201cI\u2019m absolutely going to stand in the way of anyone who thinks it\u2019s ok for a man to be in our locker room and our changing rooms, in our dressing rooms and women\u2019s bathrooms.\u201d\n\nShe later doubled down with the Stop the Invasion of Women\u2019s Spaces Act, which would block biological men from using single-sex spaces for women \u2014 restrooms, locker rooms, and changing rooms \u2014 at all federally-funded facilities.\n\n\u201cNever want to hear the Left call themselves the party of love and tolerance ever again,\u201d Mace said on X on Wednesday following the incident.\n\u201cThe Left is the party of Violence Against Women,\u201d she continued, casting doubt that she would hear a condemnation of the violence from those who oppose her position, such as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), who bizarrely asserted that preventing biological men from using women\u2019s facilities endangers women.",

    "full_text": "Maine Democrats Want to Amend State Constitution to Codify Allowing Trans Athletes in Girls\u2019 Sports Maine Democrats want to amend the state constitution to permanently allow transgender-identifying males to compete in female sports.\n\nMaine\u2019s Democrat House Majority voted on Thursday to pass a bill that would codify the Maine Human Rights Act (MHRA) in the state\u2019s constitution. The proposed bill, LD 260, passed with a slim majority and will ultimately need two-thirds majority in both chambers before it can go before voters, Fox News reported. \n\nState officials have cited the MHRA in their ongoing dispute with the Trump administration over its allowance of males in female sports and spaces. MHRA is the state\u2019s anti-discrimination law, and lawmakers added \u201cgender identity\u201d protections in 2021. \n\n\u201cOur position is that Title IX, consistent with the Maine Human Rights Act, so both federal and state law, supports that trans girls will be able to participate in high school sports consistent with their gender identity,\u201d Maine Attorney General Aaron Frey said in a recent CNN interview. \u201cSo my contention is Maine is following Title IX, Maine is following the Maine Human Rights Act.\u201d  \n\nAt the same time, Maine Republicans are working to strip \u201cgender identity\u201d from the law.\n\nThe state House voted on the legislation one day after the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) filed a lawsuit against Maine for its refusal to comply with President Trump\u2019s executive order \u201cKeeping Men Out of Women\u2019s Sports,\u201d which interprets Title IX to prohibit the inclusion of males in female sports.\n\nThe DOJ\u2019s complaint accuses Maine of \u201copenly and defiantly flouting federal anti-discrimination law.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy prioritizing gender identity over biological reality, Maine\u2019s policies deprive girl athletes of fair competition, deny them equal athletic opportunities, and expose them to heightened risks of physical injury and physiological harm,\u201d the complaint reads.\n\nRELATED: Boy Wins High School Girls\u2019 Pole Vault Competition in Maine After State Pledged to Flout Trump Order\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s executive order was created to protect female student athletes from having \u201cto compete with or against or having to appear unclothed before males.\u201d The order also mandates each federal department to \u201creview grants to education programs and, where appropriate, rescind funding to programs that fail to comply with the policy established in this order,\u201d which protects women \u201cas a matter of safety, fairness, dignity, and truth.\u201d\n\nFollowing Trump\u2019s order, Maine officials publicly said they would not comply, siding with transgender-identifying males over women and girls and citing state law allowing students to play on teams that match their \u201cgender identity.\u201d\n\nThen a transgender-identifying boy claimed the victory in the Maine Class B championship for the Greely High School girls\u2019 track and field team in February.\n\nPresident Trump and Gov. Janet Mills had a public spat on February 20, during which he said at the Republican Governor\u2019s Association dinner that Maine is at risk of losing federal funding if the state continues to allow males to play on female sports teams.\n\n\u201cWe are the federal law. You better do it, because you\u2019re not gonna get any federal funding if you don\u2019t\u2026 your population also doesn\u2019t want men in women\u2019s sports,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou better comply, or you\u2019re not getting any federal funding.\u201d\n\n\u201cSee you in court,\u201d Mills replied.\n\n\u201cGood. See you in court, that should be a real easy one,\u201d Trump fired back. \u201cEnjoy your life after, governor. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be in elected office.\u201d\n\nBoth the Department of Education and Department of Health and Human Services subsequently launched investigations into the state and ultimately found the Maine Department of Education and other entities in violation of Title IX.\n\nThe Department of Education recently began the process of cutting federal K-12 funding to Maine over the transgender debate. The USDA also began freezing funding to the state, but a federal court ultimately blocked the move.",

The event wrapped with a rally at Liberty Plaza and a press conference inside the Capitol. The day-long action arrived just before Crossover Day on March 6, which marks the deadline for bills to pass in at least one chamber to have a chance of becoming law.\n\n\u201cPride to the Capitol\u201d served as a direct response to what advocates described as a \u201ctsunami of anti-trans hate\u201d from Georgia lawmakers who made restricting the civil rights of transgender Georgians a day-one legislative priority.\n\n\u201cThis is not a time to sit on our hands,\u201d said DeMarcus Beckham, Macon-based Regional Organizer for HRC and rally host. \u201cWe need people who are willing to confront those bullies across the street [inside the State Capitol]. We don\u2019t need any more allies; we need accomplices.\u201d\n\nThe stakes couldn\u2019t have been more precise for Danieelle, a transgender woman at the rally who requested to only be identified by her first name out of fear for her safety. She tells GLAAD she is often overwhelmed by the level of hatred directed at the transgender community by elected officials.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really depressing that it\u2019s 2025, and this is still where we are,\u201d Danieelle said. \u201cTo have it directed at you personally is really scary. You want to think about leaving the country, but then you also want to stick up for people you know who can\u2019t stand up for themselves,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWhether it is intentional or just complete ignorance, they should understand that they represent us\u2014Georgians,\u201d Beckham said as he looked out into the crowd with signs that read \u201cEquality Now\u201d and \u201cHuman.\u201d\n\nAs the rally commenced, so did the advancement of SB 36, a bill proponents say is necessary to protect religious rights, while LGBTQ advocates warned it would be a license to use religious belief to discriminate against LGBTQ people and other marginalized groups. The bill passed along party lines in a 32-23 vote in the Senate on Tuesday as LGBTQ advocates inside and outside the Capitol appealed to lawmakers to resist curtailing LGBTQ progress.\n\nOut legislator, Sen. RaShaun Kemp (D-South Fulton), told The AJC that Georgians already have religious freedom. The only thing the \u201cbill does is use their religion as a free pass to discriminate.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I go to church with my husband and my two kids, I get to worship and praise God with no limitations, and you can actually do the same,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen this political playbook before,\u201d Rep. Sam Park (D-107) said inside the statehouse during the press conference. Park is also an out Georgia legislator.\n\n\u201cWhen politicians fail to address the real challenges that Georgians face, like the skyrocketing cost of living, a broken healthcare system, and a need for better economic opportunities, they look for scapegoats instead of doing the work to solve real problems affecting every Georgian.\u201d\n\nTransgender advocate, rally speaker, and history-making Miss Georgia contestant Bella Bautista defiantly echoed the sentiments of Park, Kemp, and hundreds of LGBTQ people inside Liberty Plaza.\n\n\u201cThey want us to believe that being our authentic self is too much; too controversial, too political,\u201d Bautista said. \u201cBut here\u2019s the truth: I am not a controversy. I am not a debate. I am living proof that we belong. They may try to silence us, but you cannot silence a movement.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere have been moments where I questioned my place in a world that has often tried to erase us; erase Black men, erase Black trans men, men like me,\u201d said Dr. Elijah Nicholas, founder and executive director of The Global Trans Equity Project and a rally speaker.\n\n\u201cFor every single step I\u2019ve taken\u2014every moment of doubt\u2014every triumph has taught me one thing: I am here. I am worthy. And I am not invisible,\u201d Nicholas said.\n\nFor James Waldrop, 80, being present and visible at the rally held a significant meaning as a queer man who came of age and into the awareness of his sexual orientation and gender identity during the Silent Generation. Waldrop tells GLAAD that for 70 years, he has lived a \u201cfeminine life inside a male body.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am who I am, no matter what I look like. And that\u2019s why I say my sexual orientation is not a threat to anyone. And anyone\u2019s sexual orientation should not be a threat to any other,\u201d Waldrop said.\n\nWaldrop says the current political climate has forced him out of his comfort zone.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been pushed to the point that I can no longer sit and not participate,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to be heard, so the only way to be heard is to be out and present, and that\u2019s what I want to be.\u201d\n\nThe same is true for Aeden Rowell, 22, a transgender man and Duluth, GA resident who shared his story during the press conference of being raised in conservative Jackson County, GA, in a religious family who were members of the same Episcopal church as Gov. Brian Kemp.\n\n\u201cI played the role that was expected of me, but like any performance that lasts too long, it drained me,\u201d Rowell said.\n\n\u201cMy religious community support gave me the strength to get me through a difficult time in my life. But that support alone could not change the way I saw myself in the mirror. I needed medical care, life-saving care, gender-affirming care, so when I looked at my reflection, I saw the person who I knew I always was,\u201d he added.\n\nRowell had one question for lawmakers inside the Capitol working to convince their colleagues and Georgians that his existence as a transgender person poses a threat.\n\n\u201cI ask you this: think about someone in your life who you love. If they came out to you as transgender, how would you react?\u201d We are your friends. We are your neighbors. We are your children. We sit beside you in church pews, in classrooms, in communities with you across this state. We are not a threat, but right now, our lives are under threat,\u201dRowell said.\n\nStill, according to Jeff Graham, executive director of Georgia Equality, there is reason for hope.\n\n\u201cChange happens all the time. And change will happen for the transgender community here in Georgia as well,\u201d Graham said.\n\n\u201cWe are fighting laws that want to take us backward. The challenges are real, but we\u2019ve survived it all before. We are the most resilient community imaginable. We will make sure that people have access to medical care. We will make sure that our young people have the support they need,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd we will eventually win these laws in Georgia and find a day when they stop coming after us.\u201d",

    "full_text": "Walmart Abandons Trans Products For Kids, DEI Policies Walmart, the world\u2019s largest retailer, is scaling back its diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies, according to The Associated Press.\n\nThe retailer confirmed that it would not renew a five-year commitment for a racial equity center created after the death of George Floyd in 2020, it would withdraw from a gay rights index from the LGBTQ advocacy group the Human Rights Campaign measuring workplace \u201cinclusion\u201d and it would begin tracking third-party retailers to the cease sale of transgender items for minors, according to the AP. Walmart will also stop giving priority treatment to suppliers based on DEI factors such as race or gender, the AP reported.\n\nWalmart said it will be monitoring its third-party marketplace items more closely to ensure they do not feature sexual and transgender products marketed toward minors, including chest binders intended for youth, according to the AP.\n\n\u201cOur purpose, to help people save money and live better, has been at our core since our founding 62 years ago and continues to guide us today,\u201d Walmart said in a statement shared with the Daily Caller News Foundation. \u201cWe can deliver on it because we are willing to change alongside our associates and customers who represent all of America. We\u2019ve been on a journey and know we aren\u2019t perfect, but every decision comes from a place of wanting to foster a sense of belonging, to open doors to opportunities for all our associates, customers and suppliers and to be a Walmart for everyone.\u201d\n\nVarious corporations have been quietly backpedaling their DEI practices amid intense public and legal pressure from consumers and shareholders. President-elect Donald Trump has criticized DEI practices and promised to uproot \u201cwoke\u201d ideology. Dozens of investment advisors sent letters on Nov. 15 warning several of America\u2019s largest corporations that their diversity programs will become a liability when Trump returns to the White House.\n\nSeveral companies have faced backlash from supporting DEI and LGBTQ initiatives, including Target, which reported in August 2023 that it was lowering its sales and profit expectations for the rest of the year, after it faced criticism over the release of LGBTQ products for children. Target announced in May that it would only sell its LGBTQ \u201cPride\u201d collection online and at select stores after boycotts cost the retailer nearly $13 billion in market value the summer prior, according to Bloomberg. The retailer\u2019s stock prices also dropped in 2016 amid boycotts after it introduced a policy allowing customers to choose the dressing room or restroom that aligned with their gender identity.\n\nBud Light\u2019s pours reportedly declined in thousands of bars and restaurants across the U.S. after the brand partnered with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney in 2023. The company lost $1.4 billion in U.S. beer sales in 2023 due to boycotts over the marketing decision, according to Forbes.\n\nOther major companies have also recently backtracked DEI-related policies, including Lowe\u2019s, Ford and Stanley Black & Decker. Major aviation manufacturer Boeing also scrapped its entire DEI division in October. (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: Yeti Accused Of Going \u2018Full Woke\u2019 After Years Pushing DEI, Sponsoring Trans Ideology For Kids)\n\n\u201cThis is the biggest win yet for our movement to end wokeness in corporate America,\u201d conservative activist Robby Starbuck wrote in a post to X.\n\nWalmart employed approximately 2.1 million people worldwide and approximately 1.6 million in the U.S. as of the end of the fiscal year 2024, according to their website.",

    "full_text": "Trump administration sues Maine over participation of transgender athletes in girls sports Trump\u2019s departments of Education and Health and Human Services have said Maine\u2019s education agency is violating the federal Title IX antidiscrimination law by allowing transgender girls to participate on girls teams. The Justice Department is asking the court to order the state to direct all schools to prohibit the participation of males in athletic competition designated for females.\n\n\nMaine officials have refused to agree with a settlement that would have banned transgender students from sports, arguing that the law does not prevent schools from letting transgender athletes participate. Mills said Wednesday that the lawsuit was expected and is part of a pressure campaign by Washington to force Maine to ignore its own human rights laws. \u201cThis matter has never been about school sports or the protection of women and girls, as has been claimed, it is about states rights and defending the rule of law against a federal government bent on imposing its will, instead of upholding the law,\u201d Mills said in a statement.\n\nMaine\u2019s attorney general, Aaron Frey, said Wednesday he is confident Maine is acting in accordance with state and federal law.\n\n\u201cOur position is further bolstered by the complete lack of any legal citation supporting the Administration\u2019s position in its own complaint,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cWhile the President issued an executive order that reflects his own interpretation of the law, anyone with the most basic understanding of American civics understands the president does not create law nor interpret law. \u201d\n\nThe government\u2019s complaint cites as examples the case of a transgender athlete who in February won first place in pole vault at a Maine indoor track and field meet and a transgender athlete who last year began competing in female cross country races in the state and placed first in a girl\u2019s 5K run. The lawsuit reflects a stark philosophical turnabout from the position on gender identity issues taken during Democratic administrations.\n\nUnder President Joe Biden, the government tried to extend civil rights policies to protect transgender people. In 2016, the Justice Department, then led by Attorney General Loretta Lynch, sued North Carolina over a law that required transgender people to use public restrooms and showers that corresponded the gender on their birth certificate.\n\nTrump signed an executive order in February, \u201cKeeping Men Out of Women\u2019s Sports,\u201d that gave federal agencies wide latitude to ensure entities that receive federal funding abide by Title IX in alignment with his administration\u2019s interpretation of \u201csex\u201d as the gender someone was assigned at birth.\n\nBondi was joined at the news conference by former University of Kentucky swimmer Riley Gaines, who has emerged as a public face of the opposition to transgender athletes. Gaines tied with a transgender athlete for fifth place in a 2022 NCAA championship and has testified before lawmakers across the country on the issue. She and others frame the issue as women\u2019s rights. During a February meeting with governors, Trump threatened to pull federal funding from Maine if the state did not comply with his executive order. Mills responded: \u201cWe\u2019ll see you in court.\u201d\n\nMaine sued the administration this month after the Department of Agriculture said it was pausing some money for the state\u2019s educational programs because of what the administration contended was Maine\u2019s failure to comply with the Title IX law. A federal judge on Friday ordered the administration to unfreeze funds intended for a Maine child nutrition program.\n\nQuestions over the rights of transgender people have become a major political issue in the past five years.\n\nTwenty-six states have laws or policies barring transgender girls from girls school sports. GOP-controlled states have also been banning gender-affirming health care for transgender minors and restricting bathroom use in schools and sometimes other public buildings.\n\n",

    "full_text": "VA rescinds transgender veterans' health guidance as department denies policy change The Veterans Affairs Department on Friday reversed a policy that had protected gender-affirming healthcare provided to transgender veterans, causing confusion and fear in the community.\n\nIn an internal VA memo seen by NPR Friday, the VA says it's rescinding Directive 1341, which contains detailed guidance on the kinds of care transgender veterans can receive at VA facilities. The policy had also directed healthcare providers to use pronouns veterans preferred, directed facilities to allow veterans to use bathrooms and be assigned rooms in accordance with their self-identified gender.\n\nThe internal memo said that the rescission of the directive \"does not affect existing clinical guidance\" and that the VA \"affirms its commitment to provide care to all Veterans.\" After this story was published, VA press secretary Peter Kasperowicz reached out to NPR and denied that there was a policy change. He did not respond to NPR's request to verify the authenticity of the internal memo that announced the policy change before or after publication of NPR's story.\n\nBy Saturday evening the memo was publicly available on the VA web site.\n\nIn a statement Saturday, Rep. Mark Takano (D-CA) says the VA is \"allowing veterans to be a pawn in the president's cruel political games.\"\n\n\"VA's decision to rescind its directive on providing healthcare for transgender and intersex veterans and VA's announcement that it will be taking additional steps to undertake rulemaking to revise the care offered to transgender veterans are both shameful and cruel\" said Takano, who is the highest ranking Democrat on the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n\nAdvocates had been bracing for the rescinding of the directive.\n\n\"It's disingenuous.\" said Lindsay Church, executive director of advocacy group Minority Veterans of America. \"Transgender veterans now have to ask themselves: 'Is it worth it for me to get my care at VA? Am I safe to do so? What are the discriminatory factors that I will have to face in order for me to even go to the bathroom?'\"\n\nWhile transgender people make up a small percentage of the population, research suggests that they are more likely to serve in the military.\n\nVA's research shows that veterans who are sexual minorities \u2014 including LGBTQIA, non-binary, intersex and other veterans \u2014 are more likely than average veterans to take their own lives; that figure is higher for transgender veterans. Veterans have a higher average suicide rate than the general population.\n\nIn the internal memo, the VA also said it will \"conduct a comprehensive review of care with respect to trans-identifying Veterans and will undergo the rulemaking process to revise the medical benefits package as deemed necessary\".\n\nChurch said advocates for these veterans are concerned the upcoming rule review could mean wholesale rollback on transgender health at the VA.\n\nThe VA currently offers gender-affirming healthcare that includes hormone treatment, prosthetic devices, as well as tools to help transgender veterans present as their gender identity.\n\nWhile the VA does not offer gender-affirming surgeries, the rescinded directive also stipulated that veterans could receive surgeries for other medical conditions that also happen to be gender-affirming, such as procedures mitigating cancer risks.\n\nEven before the VA rescinded Directive 1341 on Friday, VA staff members told NPR that they have been receiving more calls from trans veterans worried about trusting their healthcare providers.\n\nIn the wake of the White House executive order that says it's now U.S. policy to \"recognize two sexes, male and female,\" the VA has removed references to the group on some of its websites as well as in internal documents in its healthcare system.\n\nThe VA has yet to respond to requests for comment on the new directive.\n\nNPR's Quil Lawrence contributed to this report\n\n",

    "full_text": "Election 2025: Wisconsin\u2019s Supreme Court Candidates on the Record Early voting has begun for the April 1 election for Wisconsin\u2019s Supreme Court. Susan Crawford and Brad Schimel are running for a 10-year term. These are their records on LGBTQ issues: \n\nIn response to the question from PBS Wisconsin, \u201cDo trans people have any specific protections under the law? Are they a protected class? Do they get any other category of protection when it comes to them being singled out as a group?\u201d\n\nCrawford: \u201cThat is a question where if a case came in front of me, that was making an argument about the rights of transgender people or making a claim that they\u2019d been discriminated against or something like that, I would have to look at the law and see what protections were available, and hear out what the attorney\u2019s arguments were both for and against those kinds of protections. Obviously, look at the facts to see what was happening in that case. And then make a decision based on what I thought the facts and the law required.\u201d\nSchimel: \u201cUnder the law, they\u2019re not in a particular protected class, no, but in a courtroom, in the justice system, you don\u2019t have to be in a protected class to enjoy, to enjoy our constitutional rights. You know, I, I do name changes. Every Monday morning is when we hold name change hearings. And I have \u2014 it\u2019s routine that I have individuals who have transitioned or are transitioning, want to change their names. I respect them for that decision, and I make those name changes as a matter of routine. I\u2019ve even had some cases where they\u2019ve undergone gender change operation and want to change their birth certificate. The law provides that they can do that. That\u2019s what the law provides. My personal opinions have nothing to do with that.\u201d Crawford\u2019s LGBTQ history:\n\n\u201cRepresented Planned Parenthood in challenging, along with the state and national ACLU, a 2013 law signed by Republican Gov. Scott Walker that required abortion providers to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals.\u201d The ACLU noted \u201ca federal judge blocked the law,\u201d a decision that was upheld by a federal appeals court in both 2013 and 2015.\nCalled the 2022 overturning of Roe v. Wade \u201cwrongly decided,\u201d and noted it marked \u201cthe first time the court has ever taken away a right that was recognized and long vested under our United States Constitution.\u201d Crawford said she found it \u201cdeeply concerning \u2026 when the government starts invading some of those fundamental decisions that men and women make every day about how to live their lives and what\u2019s best for them and their families.\u201d\nIn an interview with The Daily Cardinal (University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison\u2019s student newspaper), Crawford told young voters she is \u201clooking to protect their rights under our Constitution and under our state laws and make sure that their fundamental freedoms are protected.\u201d Referencing Brad Schimel\u2019s remarks against reproductive freedom, she added, \u201cI think young people should be concerned about a candidate who has an extreme position like that and is so willing to take rights away from people.\u201d\nIn a guest column in The Cap Times, Crawford affirmed her commitment \u201cto protecting the fundamental rights and freedoms of all Wisconsinites.\u201d Drawing from her personal experience, Crawford said she \u201crepresented Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin and their doctors to protect women\u2019s access to reproductive health care services.\u201d\nSaid she prefers a \u201ccommon sense\u201d approach to reproductive rights rather than being labeled as \u201cpro-choice,\u201d a term she avoids \u201cbecause of its policy implications and the way it\u2019s been politicized.\u201d Schimel\u2019s LGBTQ history:\n\nIn 2014, while campaigning for attorney general, \u201cSchimel pledged to defend Wisconsin\u2019s ban on same-sex marriage and initially said he would refuse to uphold a 2009 state law granting domestic partnership benefits to same-sex couples.\u201d Schimel later shifted his position on the latter, but remained committed \u201cto enforcing the state\u2019s same-sex marriage ban.\u201d\nCompared same-sex couples to Nazi skinheads in describing the religious exemption rights of Masterpiece Cakeshop plaintiff who fought to the U.S. Supreme Court to discriminate against a gay couple shopping for a wedding cake: \u201cWhat if a person who is a minority owns a store and a couple of Nazi skinheads come in and demand that [the owner] provides a service?\u201d Schimel said. \u201cCan that person say no? I don\u2019t know that they can if the Supreme Court decides that [the bakery owner] can be forced to make this cake.\u201d \nAs attorney general, hired Misha Tseytlin to be solicitor general. Tseytlin \u201cplayed a central role in crafting the legal strategy to dismantle Roe v. Wade.\u201d Schimel has an extensive record of attacks against reproductive freedom and once said Wisconsin has no \u201cconstitutional right to abortion.\u201d\nAP: Wisconsin taxpayers paid about $1,000 to send one of Schimel\u2019s top lawyers to an event sponsored by Alliance Defending Freedom, a group with a long history of advocating against LGBTQ people and equality and a designated hate group by Southern Poverty Law Center. Schimel claimed the group only wants to make sure \u201cLGBTQ+ rights did not interfere with the rights of other people.\u201d\nAccused the Wisconsin Supreme Court\u2019s liberal, female majority of being \u201cdriven by their emotions\u201d in determining whether to uphold the state\u2019s 1849 abortion ban. \u201cYou could see it in their eyes, and you could hear it in the tone of their voice.\u201d\nAt a recent campaign event in Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, Schimel sided with business owners who wished to use religious grounds to turn away LGBTQ couples. When an \u201cattendee asked whether Schimel would do anything to protect \u2018those of us who don\u2019t want to hire or offer services\u2019 to people whose marriages \u2018violate our religious beliefs,\u2019 Schimel responded, \u2018Your religious rights need to be protected.\u2019\u201d In a 2017 interview with Wisconsin Eye, Schimel suggested that marriage equality could pave the way for LGBTQ couples to \u201ctake their right to be married and now infringe on the legitimate religious liberty beliefs or rights of a person who is an artist. This isn\u2019t going down to the corner grocery store and buying a box of Ding Dongs. This is somebody who creates art.\u201d In fact, the opposite happened: attempts at expanding religious exemptions to more scenarios to discriminate against LGBTQ people followed the narrow ruling in Masterpiece. Anti-LGBTQ legal group Alliance Defending Freedom reportedly shopped for plaintiffs to continue to challenge anti-discrimination laws in 303 Creative, featuring a web designer who had not been approached by any LGBTQ person or couple.\nExpressed willingness to enforce a ban on marriage equality if the U.S. Supreme Court overturns Obergefell v. Hodges. At a campaign event in Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, Schimel said: \u201cWe have a constitutional amendment that\u2019s still on the books.\u201d Schimel previously explained his personal beliefs on marriage equality in an interview with Eye on Oshkosh in 2014, 18 months before the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s Obergefell decision legalized marriage equality nationwide: \u201cAs I do my job as attorney general, my personal view on that issue has no business entering into the equation. My job as the state\u2019s lawyer is to defend Wisconsin\u2019s law \u2026 until the Supreme Court says it\u2019s unconstitutional or the people change it. So, you start with that, but my view is I favor traditional marriage: one man, one woman. That\u2019s my personal view in my personal life, and that\u2019s how I voted when the marriage amendment was on the ballot. Now, that doesn\u2019t mean that I don\u2019t accept that people of the same sex can be deeply in love with each other, and committed to each other. I wonder whether the government ought to be in the marriage business at all, and whether we ought to leave that to religion and other things.\u201d\nCriticized transgender singer Laura Jane Grace, who opened a Wisconsin rally held by Sen. Bernie Sanders with a performance of \u201cYour God.\u201d Schimel said the song was an \u201cabsolutely grotesque attack on people of faith.\u201d \nRan an anti-transgender ad campaign featuring a parent accusing Susan Crawford of supporting the \u201cradical agenda\u201d of special interests. \u201cLet transitioning males use my girls\u2019 bathrooms at school? Allow boys to compete against them in sports? Giving puberty-blocking drugs to children without parents\u2019 consent? That\u2019s who Susan Crawford sides with.\u201d\nRefused to comment on anti-transgender text messages from \u201cWin Wisconsin, Win the Future,\u201d a group which is not \u201cregistered with the state, the Federal Election Commission or the Internal Revenue Service.\u201d The texts ask if \u201cparents should have the right to know if their child is transitioning genders at school\u201d and warn \u201cISSUES LIKE THIS COULD BE DECIDED BY THE WI SUPREME COURT.\u201d\nFair Wisconsin, the state\u2019s only statewide LGBTQ+ civil rights and political advocacy organization, issued a statement on the election: \u201cBrad Schimel would be a dangerous addition to the Wisconsin Supreme Court because he poses a threat to our rights, both for the rights of Wisconsinites in general and for the LGBTQ+ community in particular. Schimel has recently launched an anti-trans attack ad, and I find his cynical attempt to sow fear by preying on our trans friends, family, and neighbors in Wisconsin absolutely disgusting. As I have said before in the face of anti-trans attacks, we cannot let these ugly ads work. People are not issues; children are not weapons; health care, safety, and support are for everyone. Every bill passed into law, and every decision made by a court has an impact on the LGBTQ+ community, and that is why we need to have a court we can rely on to protect our rights as Wisconsinites, including LGBTQ+ Wisconsinites \u2013 our rights to safety, health, and the freedom to live as our authentic selves and love who we love.\u201d\n\nGLAAD statement: \u201cAll elections are a chance for voters to use their voices, and the Wisconsin Supreme Court race is one with a ten-year impact on LGBTQ people as well as fairness and impartiality. Voters can review the LGBTQ records of the candidates to understand how they will defend or dismantle protections for LGBTQ people, as well as reproductive rights. The election on April 1 will have a profound and lasting influence on the safety and equality of all Wisconsinites.\u201d\n\nThe court is expected to decide the future of abortion in the state and could redraw a congressional map. \n\nIn addition, there is a proposed constitutional amendment on the ballot that seeks to embed Wisconsin\u2019s voter ID law into the state constitution. Wisconsin currently requires voters to present their photo ID in person at the polls.\n\nAccording to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, \u201cThe referendum isn\u2019t asking whether to get rid of or keep that law. It\u2019ll remain in place regardless of the referendum results.\u201d Instead, it seeks to permanently add the voter ID law into the state constitution.\nCrawford previously expressed opposition to the law and called it \u201cdraconian,\u201d but declined to share how she would vote. Schimel is in favor of the state\u2019s voter ID law and said he would support the resolution.\nStrict voter ID laws can create barriers for transgender people, \u201cboth because of difficulties in obtaining an ID that\u2019s accepted, or because they might run into bias or misunderstandings of the law when it comes to their gender.\u201d\nUnelected billionaire Elon Musk has endorsed Schimel and donated to groups that have reportedly spent more than $10 million in ads against Schimel\u2019s opponent, Susan Crawford (including one that used a photo of the wrong individual to represent Crawford). Investigative reporters have noted that the groups have posted Facebook ads making false claims about Crawford\u2019s position on cash bail. Crawford has not taken a position on cash bail.\n\nThe GLAAD ALERT Desk (Anti-LGBTQ Extremism Reporting Tracker) has documented 47 anti-LGBTQ incidents in Wisconsin since June 2022, including three bomb threats, three cases of vandalism, and two assaults. Examples include:\n\nOn Feb. 1, 2025, an individual mailed anti-LGBTQ letters to an LGBTQ person / former pastor at their home in Oak Creek, Wisconsin. The letters addressed the victim, calling them a \u201cqueer piece of sh*t.\u201d\nStarting on March 8, 2024, at least four bomb threats were called into Butler Middle School in Waukesha, Wisconsin. The threats followed a post by Libs of TikTok four days prior, which showed a school employee posting about his partner and saying: \u201cAcceptance, equity and inclusion should be cornerstones of our schools.\u201d\n(TW) On Feb. 26, 2023, an individual shot and killed a transgender woman at her apartment in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The perpetrator allegedly filmed her death while making anti-trans comments.",

    "full_text": "\u201cSimply Trying to Exist\u201d: How Trans Americans Are Navigating the Confusion and Chaos of Trump\u2019s Passport Policy When C.J. Parker got his new passport in the mail, he was initially in disbelief. Parker thought that the contents of the UPS envelope that he had opened must have been a mistake: The 27-year-old\u2019s corrected birth certificate and a court order certifying his name and gender change had seemingly been destroyed. The judge\u2019s order was ripped in two with a piece missing, meaning Parker couldn\u2019t just tape it back together. His birth certificate was not only torn but it also appeared to have been partially burned; tiny black flakes spilled onto his kitchen table. And the passport he had received was itself unusable: The cover was deformed and melted.\n\n\u201cI, at first, tried to say, \u2018Well, maybe it was an accident. Maybe it got stuck in a printer.\u2019 That was my first thought,\u201d Parker, who requested to go by a pseudonym due to fear of retaliation, tells Them. He soon realized that the now-ruined paperwork was everything he owned that legally certified his gender as a trans man. \u201cRegardless of what happened, somebody took all of these documents and put them in the envelope and sent them to me that way, fully knowingly.\u201d\n\nMaking matters worse, Parker\u2019s new passport had the wrong gender marker listed on it: a jarring \u201cF\u201d where he had hoped that an \u201cM\u201d would be. He was still convinced that he must have hallucinated what had happened when he telephoned his state representative for help. The lawmaker became silent over the phone as he explained the situation, and when she expressed that she was at a loss for words, the moment\u2019s enormity hit him, and he suddenly started to sob. The deluge of grief startled him: Parker has never been prone to tears, and starting testosterone, he says, has made it near-impossible to cry.\n\nSpeaking over the phone with Them from his home, Parker says his heart is still racing as he talks about it. He says he feels stuck in place, as if he is sinking lower and lower into the floor. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m losing it,\u201d he says. \u201cI keep having moments where I think, \u2018Someone couldn\u2019t have done that. Someone wouldn\u2019t do that. Then I look at it and I say, \u2018No, I am looking at exactly what I\u2019m looking at. One plus one equals two.\u2019\u201d\n\nThese emotions are sadly familiar for many trans Americans who have been denied corrected passports since President Donald Trump\u2019s second inauguration in January. Just one day after Trump resumed office, he issued an executive order directing the State Department to halt all updates to gender markers on U.S. passports and discontinue the gender-neutral \u201cX\u201d designation. Following that guidance, numerous trans, nonbinary, and intersex people have reported receiving inaccurate gender markers on their passports, including Euphoria actress Hunter Schafer, who called the situation a \u201charsh reality check\u201d in a since-deleted TikTok video.\n\n\u201cYou know how they say that when a child is in danger, a mom could lift a bus off them, from the force of adrenaline? I feel like right now I\u2019m tasked with lifting the entire White House and everyone in it off of my daughter.\u201d\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) is currently suing the Trump administration on behalf of seven plaintiffs who were all denied passports that reflect their lived identities as trans people. In a statement, the ACLU describes the refusal of accurate documentation as a \u201cchaotic policy clearly motivated by animus that serves zero public interest\u201d and a \u201cblatant effort to violate their privacy and deny [trans people] their freedom to be themselves.\u201d\n\nAs the ACLU\u2019s lawsuit moves through the courts, trans people and their loved ones say that the inability to get accurate passports has destabilized their lives and made their futures uncertain. In states that place burdensome restrictions on updating birth certificates, driver\u2019s licenses, and state IDs, applying for a corrected passport has, for many, served as the safer and easier alternative. In 2021, the Biden administration announced that it would no longer require trans people to provide medical documentation certifying their transition before being granted a corrected passport. Under Biden, in 2021, the State Department said that it would begin issuing \u201cX\u201d gender markers following a years-long lawsuit from intersex activist Dana Zzyym.\n\nLacking access to those documents, as sources tell Them, makes it harder for trans people to move through the world without issue. After being sent an inaccurate passport in February, 29-year-old Lily Powers said that she worries about \u201csticking out like a sore thumb\u201d while passing through airport security. \u201cI don\u2019t want someone to see me when I\u2019m traveling and have a reason to question me,\u201d she said. \u201cFor me to have an \u2018M\u2019 on my passport puts me in danger immediately.\u201d\n\nPowers had been crossing her fingers, hoping that she might somehow slip through the cracks of the new administration\u2019s policies. She filed her application for a corrected passport at the beginning of January, and a few days before Trump\u2019s inauguration, Powers called the U.S. Passport Office and told them that she planned to visit a friend in Canada, hoping that her correction would then be expedited. But when she received an inaccurate passport three weeks later, Powers also received a notice from the Bureau of Consular Affairs detailing why she had received an \u201cM\u201d on her documents. On the sheet, an agent had circled two phrases: \u201cSex\u201d and \u201cTo Match Our Records.\u201d\n\n\u201ct felt like I\u2019ve been let down by my government. It felt like I\u2019d been let down by the American people. It felt like I was being rejected and ostracized by society at large for simply trying to exist.\u201d\n\nBefore this incident, Powers said that transitioning had been a wholly positive experience. She had been severely depressed before coming out as a trans woman, and she credits her transition with saving her life. \u201cI\u2019m happier than I\u2019ve ever been because I\u2019ve chosen to live and be happy,\u201d Powers says. \u201cAs someone who\u2019s a little more than three and a half years into her transition, it\u2019s really, really frustrating to be slapped in the face with this.\u201d\n\nAlthough Powers said that she was just beginning the long journey of updating her documents, what concerns Eris Discordia Montano, 53, is that the vast majority of her other identification accurately reflects her gender. Montano has an \u201cF\u201d on her driver\u2019s license and in the national Social Security database. If someone were to question why her documents don\u2019t match, such as a TSA agent or even a potential employer, Montano said that the answer could prove a problem for her. \u201cIt's a terrible, terrifying feeling,\u201d she tells Them.\n\nWhen the \u201cM\u201d passport was mailed to her ex-wife\u2019s house in February, Montano flashed back to the despair she felt after the 2024 presidential election: the knowledge that, while she would survive the casual brutality of the next four years, she didn\u2019t want to be forced to do so. \u201cIt felt like I\u2019ve been let down by my government,\u201d Montano says. \u201cIt felt like I\u2019d been let down by the American people. It felt like I was being rejected and ostracized by society at large for simply trying to exist.\u201d\n\nFor parents with trans kids, restricting the ability to apply for corrected passports makes it more difficult for them to plan for worst-case scenarios. In the early days of his new term, Trump enacted a series of orders targeting both trans youth and adults, including threatening health practitioners that provide gender-affirming care to minors with the loss of federal funding and limiting sports participation for trans student athletes. His administration is also punishing schools that permit trans students to \u201csocially transition\u201d on campus and erasing federal resources geared toward the LGBTQ+ community, such as removing mentions of queer youth from StopBullying.gov\n\nFearing how bad things might get under another Trump presidency, Lisa Suhay, 59, paid what she describes as \u201cexorbitant\u201d fees to expedite her 19-year-old daughter Mellow\u2019s first-ever passport. Suhay hoped to be able to rush the application through, but the day Trump\u2019s directive hit, they had to make a tough choice: Would they change the application to an \u201cM\u201d marker or risk the passport being rejected altogether? Fearing that a lack of documentation could jeopardize the possibility of fleeing the country in an emergency, they decided to play it safe with a male passport.\n\nWhile Mellow says that it\u2019s \u201cdisturbing\u201d that she has to be legally misgendered for her own safety, her mother notes that they are in uncharted waters. She says that she has called numerous attorneys, and no one can give her family a clear answer as to how they should navigate the \u201chorrific legal situation\u201d the country finds itself in. Suhay says that, some days, it feels like they\u2019re caught in a trap. \u201cYou know how they say that when a child is in danger, a mom could lift a bus off them, from the force of adrenaline?\u201d she tells Them. \u201cI feel like right now I\u2019m tasked with lifting the entire White House and everyone in it off of my daughter.\u201d\n\nThose affected by Trump\u2019s new passport policies said they are attempting to remain resilient and keep up the fight, but many admit that the past few weeks have been a low point. Fay Mortenson, 50, tells Them that she \u201cdropped to the floor sobbing\u201d after getting her 16-year-old son\u2019s passport back with an \u201cF\u201d on it. When she saw in the State Department\u2019s online database in February that the passport had been \u201capproved,\u201d Mortenson prayed that, for some reason, they had been spared the agonies others were suffering. She saw social media posts from trans people who had gotten their passports back damaged or had their applications put on hold, but just maybe, they got lucky. \u201cI had this tiny sliver of hope,\u201d she tells Them, \u201cand then it was just gone.\u201d\n\nMortenson, who asked to use a pseudonym for this story, says she has been attending rallies and vigils in her home state to regain her optimism, but she\u2019s finding it tough. She cycles through so many emotions throughout her day \u2014 rage, sadness, fear, and loneliness \u2014 but ultimately, she says she feels disoriented, as if the world around her is \u201cin this free fall and there\u2019s nobody to catch us right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople are just trying to live their lives,\u201d she says. \u201cIt is in no way a threat to anyone or anything for someone to have the correct documents. It\u2019s just cruel.\u201d\n\n",

    "full_text": "Fact Sheet: Transgender Participation in Sports Journalists covering legislation about transgender participation in sports should include these facts and context in their coverage, seek transgender voices in stories about transgender issues, challenge politicians\u2019 rhetoric to provide facts to back up any claims, and include any history of targeting LGBTQ people (200+ profiles on the GLAAD Accountability Project, here).\n\nTransgender people make up a tiny fraction of all athletes. NCAA President Charlie Baker testified in December 2024 that he knows of fewer than ten transgender college student-athletes among 510,000 athletes total.\nAll players follow protocols to participate. International Olympic Committee guidelines for transgender inclusion say there should be \u201cno presumed advantage\u201d based on sex assigned at birth or sex characteristics. IOC guidelines were created in consultation with experts in sports, medicine, and human rights.\nSports bans are part of a systematic and expanding targeting of transgender people and youth that has surged to include their medically-necessary and supported health care, book bans and curriculum bans, and access to the restroom.\nResearch shows states that include transgender participation have more girls participating in sports than states with bans. Claims that trans inclusion harms girls\u2019 sports are inaccurate and baseless.\nWomen and girls face significant barriers in sports that have nothing to do with transgender inclusion: inequitable facilities, pay, and marketing; abusive coaches; and racist, sexist, and homophobic harassment. Ask critics of transgender inclusion what efforts they have made to resolve real issues harming women and girls in sports.\nA 2024 NCAA study shows female players receive a barrage of social media harassment. 80% of abusive posts were directed at March Madness athletes, with female basketball players receiving about three times more abusive messages than their male counterparts.\nThe 2024 NCAA women\u2019s basketball and WNBA seasons and championships saw their highest ratings Women\u2019s sports are not suffering because trans people might be included.\nSports bans endanger all female players by encouraging baseless, false allegations and discriminatory, invasive screening. A college volleyball team in California had to get security to protect teams when one player was accused of being transgender. A high school player in Utah falsely accused of being transgender had to get police protection and a Utah elected official was censured for sharing disinformation about her. Bans on trans athletes have led to invasive screening that violate the privacy and safety of all women and girls, and discourages more who might want to play. Athletes of all ages and abilities who are not trans have been bullied and harassed when accused of being trans.\nSex verification testing, which is being pushed by opponents of transgender people who say bans on sports participation are not enough, could cost schools and leagues anywhere from $1,000 to $15,000+ per athlete. Opponents have not explained where funding for these invasive tests would come from.\nLGBTQ athletes continue to face challenges based on their identities. While LGBTQ acceptance in sports has advanced in recent years, racism, sexism, transphobia, homophobia, biphobia, and colonialism are ongoing barriers for LGBTQ athletes from multiple marginalized identities. Harmful policies, attitudes, and discourse about LGBTQ people in sports are directed at transgender people, people with intersex traits, people of color, people from non-Western countries, women who do not fit conventional norms around femininity, as well as men who do not fit outdated norms of masculinity.\nAthletes come in all shapes and sizes including physical advantages helpful to their sports, such as Michael Phelps\u2019 long arms and Simone Biles\u2019 compact size that help them excel, yet those physical attributes have never been used to restrict or ban their participation. Being an athlete is also more than bodies \u2013 it is about courage, dedication, luck, talent, and most urgently, expanding access and encouragement for all who want to play.\nSeek transgender voices in stories about transgender people.\nChallenge lawmakers proposing bills to provide evidence for any claims about athlete safety and privacy.\nInclude lawmakers\u2019 history of activating against women and LGBTQ equality (marriage, adoption, book bans, workplace discrimination, and efforts to restrict reproductive health care that have proven deadly for female patients nationwide.) Claims about \u201ckeeping women and girls safe\u201d should be contrasted with a record that explicitly endangers them.\nSeek expert opinion. South Carolina Gamecocks coach Dawn Staley said in 2024 that transgender women are women and all women should be able to play sports if they want to. The championship coach, who knows the game best and has nurtured and inspired hundreds of players, believes transgender women should be able to play. Listen to women who are in the game, who understand the real challenges their players face, and have worked to make more athletes feel welcome.\nChallenge paid spokespeople for evidence that blanket bans improve participation and fairness. Seek and include athletes who support transgender inclusion, not just those with time and monetized incentive to target transgender people.\nCDC research shows that transgender youth face disproportionate bullying, distress and increased risk of self-harm from being socially ostracized and excluded at school. 40% of transgender and questioning students have experienced bullying at school. 25% of transgender students and 26% of questioning students skipped school because they felt unsafe, compared with 8.5% of cisgender male students.\nThe CDC urged schools to \u201ccreate safer and more supportive environments for transgender and questioning students\u201d with inclusive activities, mental health and other health service referrals, and implementing policies that are LGBTQ-inclusive. \u201cHaving supportive families and peers, feeling connected to family and school, having affirmed name and pronouns used consistently by others, and having a sense of pride of identity are protective factors for transgender students that buffer the effects of minority stressors and promote better mental health.\u201d\nInclude the benefits of sports for all children and their peers, and how trans youth would be unfairly and harmfully excluded from these experiences and lessons. Sports offer multitudes of benefits, including being active and healthy, making friends, feeling a sense of belonging and purpose, learning how to be gracious competitors as well as winners and losers, learning how to cooperate as a team, learning how to emotionally regulate, learning new skills, learning how to set and achieve goals. Sports participation is proven to improve academic performance, boost social and emotional wellbeing, and build skills and relationships that help youth succeed in all facets of life.",

To that end, President Trump's order provides a clear, national standard.\n\n\"The NCAA Board of Governors is reviewing the executive order and will take necessary steps to align NCAA policy in the coming days, subject to further guidance from the administration. The Association will continue to help foster welcoming environments on campuses for all student-athletes. We stand ready to assist schools as they look for ways to support any student-athletes affected by changes in the policy.\"\n\nBaker addressed concerns over the issue of female athletes having to share teams and locker rooms with trans athletes during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in December. \n\nThere, Baker insisted that female athletes have the option to find other accommodations if they're uncomfortable sharing with transgenders and that the NCAA's policies that allow trans athletes to compete against women are based on federal standards. \n\nThe previous policy has resulted in multiple lawsuits against the NCAA and its member schools. Former NCAA swimmer and current conservative activist Riley Gaines is leading a lawsuit over her experience of having to compete with and share a locker room with trans swimmer Lia Thomas at the 2022 national championships. She is joined by several other women athletes who have also been affected by trans inclusion. \n\nAnother lawsuit was filed Tuesday evening, when three of Thomas' former UPenn teammates came forward with their own experiences of having to share a team and locker room with Thomas and were allegedly gaslit by their university administrators and fed pro-trans ideology. \n\nTrump's Department of Education (DOE) also launched an investigation into potential Title IX violations that occurred at UPenn over the Thomas situation, San Jose State University and at the Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Association (MIAA) for separate incidents.\n\nAt San Jose State, transgender volleyball player Blaire Fleming played three seasons on the women's team from 2022-24, as one of the Mountain West's top hitters, leading the team in kills. However, unlike UPenn's handling of Thomas, SJSU administrators allegedly withheld the truth about Fleming's birth sex from the other female players on the team, according to a lawsuit filed by 11 Mountain West volleyball players and a former SJSU assistant coach. \n\nAdditionally, DOE's Office for Civil Rights will be actively reviewing athletic participation policies at a number of schools to evaluate their alignment with Title IX protections for female athletes, sources told Fox News Digital. \n\nLast week, the DOE notified K-12 schools and higher education institutions of a return to enforcing Title IX protections on the basis of biological sex. \n\nA recent New York Times/Ipsos survey found the vast majority of Americans, including a majority of Democrats, don't think transgender athletes should be permitted to compete in women's sports. Of the 2,128 people polled, 79% said biological males who identify as women should not be allowed to participate in women's sports. \n\nOf the 1,025 people who identified as Democrats or leaning Democrat, 67% said transgender athletes should not be allowed to compete with women.",

    "full_text": "Forced Off Her Track Team, A Trans High Schooler in Virginia Joined the Boys Instead A transgender high school girl in Virginia has been effectively forced to join a boys\u2019 track and field team after state authorities introduced new restrictions on trans athletes to align with the Trump administration earlier this year.\n\nIn a profile for the Washington Post this week, Eliza Munshi, a senior at Falls Church High School in Virginia, said that she applied to join the girls\u2019 track team in early February. Munshi said she was inspired to join following news reports that the Virginia High School League (VHSL), the nonprofit organization which governs K-12 school sports in the state, would not change its trans-inclusive policies \u2014 most significantly a waiver process by which trans girls could apply to compete on girls\u2019 teams \u2014 to adhere to President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order seeking to ban trans women from women\u2019s sports leagues.\n\nBut the VHSL reversed that statement just days later, as Virginia Public Media (VPM) reported. Munshi told the Post that during her fourth practice with the girls\u2019 team, adults abruptly informed her she would no longer be allowed to compete with them. Along with an eight-point test governing trans boys\u2019 eligibility for boys\u2019 sports teams, the VHSL\u2019s updated handbook now specifies that trans girls \u201cmay not participate on a girls sports team other than cheerleading,\u201d specifically citing Trump\u2019s February executive order. Another section of the rulebook, which was already in place, notes that if an athlete who is \u201cofficially declared ineligible\u201d competes anyway, the athlete\u2019s \u201cschool shall be automatically suspended from the League for a period of one calendar year\u201d unless their participation was required by a court order.\n\n\u201c[W]e really felt like if we\u2019re to be the governing body of the Virginia High School League, our policies need to be in compliance with the executive order,\u201d VHSL executive director Billy Haun told VPM in a statement in February, \u201cso that our member schools and school divisions wouldn't have to choose between the league and the executive order.\u201d (Haun is VHSL\u2019s outgoing executive director, and is set to hand over the reins to current Assistant Director of Compliance Ty Gafford in July.)\n\nNot wanting her participation to negatively affect her friends on the girls\u2019 team, Munshi told her coach she would compete on the boys\u2019 team instead. She told the Post that despite the policy changes, everyone at her school has continued to make her feel welcome. \u201cSometimes I forget I\u2019m transgender. People around me forget too,\u201d she wrote last year in a college admissions essay, per the Post.\n\nLegally speaking, executive orders do not directly compel compliance outside of the executive branch of the federal government. But since taking office, the Trump administration has leaned on many such orders \u2014 some of which have already been blocked pending litigation \u2014 to demand state and local entities adhere to his sweeping anti-trans agend, or risk losing all federal funding. Trump has used his order regarding trans athletes in particular to threaten lawsuits and loss of funding for the University of Pennsylvania and multiple educational bodies across Maine for alleged noncompliance with his interpretation of Title IX civil rights law. The NCAA voluntarily altered its own participation rules to adhere to Trump\u2019s order earlier this year. Meanwhile, two teens in New Hampshire are challenging Trump\u2019s sports order in court, along with a state law that bars them from competing in girls\u2019 leagues.\n\nState and local bans on trans girls in K-12 and college sports continue to proliferate across the U.S., as conservatives have latched onto the topic as a useful wedge issue against LGBTQ+ rights. Such bans are often justified with assertions that trans girls have a \u201cbiological advantage\u201d over their cis peers in sports, even if they have received puberty blockers or hormone therapy to suppress testosterone levels. Those claims are not supported by current research. In fact, a 2024 study backed by the International Olympic Committee found that trans women who have suppressed their testosterone may face competitive disadvantages compared to cis women in some key metrics like vertical leap. (The Post reported that one of Munshi\u2019s best discus throws measure just shy of 47 feet; the current U.S. high school girls\u2019 record for discus throw is 193 feet and eight inches, set by athlete Emma Sralla in 2023.)\n\n\u201cThe way I kind of look at this right now is advanced compliance before all the legal maneuvering is done, and before courts have made their final decisions,\u201d said State Sen. Danica Roem, considered the first trans state lawmaker in U.S. history, in comments to VPM about VHSL\u2019s policy changes in February. \u201cI think it is going to cause actual harm to the people who are most vulnerable right now.\u201d",

In the six days since the executive order on Jan. 28 titled \u201cProtecting Children from Chemical and Surgical Mutilation\u201d (discussed here), three new significant developments have taken place, two highly positive ones that are coming from the Trump administration and one very negative one coming from Democrats. (RELATED: Trump Protects Children From Woke Abuse: New Executive Order Bans Chemical and Surgical Mutilation)\nThe Trump Administration Purifies the Executive Branch of \u201cGender Ideology\u201d\n\nOn Jan. 29, the Office of Personnel Management sent out a memo to all the heads of departments and agencies, telling them to end the promotion of \u201cgender ideology\u201d (the idea that males can become female and females male) in accordance with Trump\u2019s EO \u201cDefending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government,\u201d and to do so by Friday, Jan. 31 at 5 p.m. (READ MORE: Trump\u2019s Executive Order Ends \u2018Trans\u2019 Tyranny and Protects Females)\n\nThe scope and speed of the transgender housecleaning was impressive:\n\n    Take down all federal websites or information within them that promote gender ideology.\n    Terminate \u201call agency programs, contracts, and grants\u201d and withdraw any regulations or directives that \u201cpromote \u2026 gender ideology.\u201d\n    Require all federal employees to remove pronouns from their email signatures.\n    \u201cEnsure that intimate spaces \u2026 are designated by biological sex and not gender identity.\u201d No more biological males in female restrooms.\n    Cancel any training that promotes gender ideology \u2014 no more struggle sessions.\n    Remove from all documents \u201cgender\u201d or \u201cgender identity\u201d and replace with \u201csex,\u201d allowing only the binary option of \u201cmale\u201d or \u201cfemale.\u201d\n    Put on \u201cpaid administrative leave\u201d \u201call employees whose position description involves \u2026 promoting gender ideology.\u201d\n\nCompliance with the memo was reached by the deadline. Naturally, the left-wing media went into spasms over this memo (for examples go here, here, here, and here). Yet it was a boldly positive move for the country, which is growing increasingly tired of having to violate reason, conscience, and faith, not to mention endanger women and children, in order to appease the transgender idol.\n\nMy only regret is that the promotion of \u201csexual orientation\u201d did not incur the same fate as \u201cgender identity.\u201d\nThe First Fruits of Trump\u2019s Executive Order Combatting Trans Child Abuse\n\nThe second new (and positive) development was celebrated by the White House in a statement released on Feb. 3., Trump\u2019s executive order \u201cProtecting Children from Chemical and Surgical Mutilation\u201d was \u201calready having its intended effect \u2014 preventing children from being maimed and sterilized by adults perpetuating a radical, false claim that they can somehow change a child\u2019s sex.\u201d\n\nHospitals were the most impacted by the executive order: \u201cHospitals around the country are taking action to downsize or eliminate their so-called \u2018gender-affirming care\u2019 programs.\u201d The following are cases in point:\n\n    Denver Health in Colorado, while obviously not wanting to comply with Trump\u2019s EO, recognized in a Jan. 30 statement that they had little choice in the matter, since the EO\n\n    includes criminal and financial consequences for those who do not comply, including placing participation in federal programs including Medicare, Medicaid and other programs administered by HHS at risk. These programs represent a significant portion of Denver Health\u2019s funding\u2026. The loss of this funding would critically impair our ability to provide care for the Denver community.\n\nHow much is \u201ca significant portion\u201d? About $350 million per year in lost funding for Denver Health. Money talks even to transgender advocates who normally lack \u201cthe ears to hear.\u201d\n\n    Other hospitals that have \u201cpaused\u201d or \u201csuspended\u201d the use of puberty blockers, cross-gender hormones, and transgender surgery on minors include: Children\u2019s National Hospital in Washington, D.C.; Children\u2019s Hospital of Richmond, VA and Virginia Commonwealth University Health; and \u201cChildren\u2019s Hospital of The King\u2019s Daughters\u201d in Norfolk, VA.\n    New York City\u2019s NYU Langone Health, \u201cone of several major medical centers in the city with transgender health programs for youths,\u201d reportedly began canceling puberty-blocking arm implants for 12-year-olds. New York has a huge \u201ctransgender child\u201d problem from its coercive trans-indoctrination of children in the schools and the media. According to the New York Times, a whopping 3 percent of children aged 13 to 17 in the state of New York identify as transgender.\n\nDemocrats Strike Back in an Attempt to Reinstate Chemical Castration of Children\n\nThe third new development is a negative one: An attempt by Democrats to reinstate the destruction of children\u2019s bodies. This has taken two forms.\n\nFirst, New York\u2019s notorious attorney general, Letitia James, sent a letter on Feb. 3 threatening hospitals with prosecution for violating the state\u2019s anti-discrimination laws regarding \u201cgender identity\u201d as a protected class if they don\u2019t continue dispensing puberty blockers and cross-gender hormones to children. James is determined to continue the practice of state-sponsored child abuse, lying to impressionable children about whether they can switch sexes, transitioning them to lifelong sterility and gender freakishness without any thought for how neurological, psychological, and sociological factors may be fueling their gender dysphoria.\n\nSecond, two Democrat Federal District Court judges have issued temporary restraining orders designed to thwart Trump\u2019s attempt to manage federal funding consistent with his EOs. One restraining order was issued on Jan. 31 by the judge of the U.S. District Court of Rhode Island, John McConnell, an Obama appointee, in response to a lawsuit brought by Democratic state attorneys general.\n\nThe complaint had to do with the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s general freeze on federal assistance to the states until a review of federal programs and policies could be made. The judge ruled that, until further order of the court, the federal government will not be able to \u201cstop, delay, or otherwise withhold federal financial assistance programs\u201d to the states.\n\nOn Feb. 3, the U.S. District Court Judge for the District of Columbia, Loren AliKhan, a Biden appointee, in response to a lawsuit brought by nonprofits, issued a similar (but even more hostile) temporary restraining order. She indicated that the Trump administration would likely be ruled against for not \u201ctaking a measured approach to identify purportedly wasteful spending.\u201d According to the acting director for the Office of Management and Budget, these rulings may affect Trump\u2019s EOs, including \u201cfinancial assistance for \u2026 DEI, woke gender ideology, and the Green New Deal,\u201d pending further clarity by these judges.\n\nIt remains to be seen how this will all pan out. Not every issue is straightforward and obvious. This one is: The protection of children from the harmful clutches of transgender activism is a clear case of good. The pursuit of children by leftist sexual extremists, scarring children for life and destroying biological realities, is an obvious instance of evil.",

    "full_text": "Over 850 Anti-LGBTQ+ Bills Filed In The U.S. So Far In 2025 Over the past five years, Republican lawmakers have turned anti-trans legislation into a full-blown political obsession. What began as a handful of bills targeting sports participation and so-called religious exemptions has metastasized into a sweeping campaign against nearly every facet of transgender life\u2014bathroom access, IDs, medical care, even the legality of one\u2019s identity. In 2020, there were just over 100 bills aimed at LGBTQ+ people. In 2025, that number has ballooned to more than 850, the vast majority singling out transgender Americans. What we are witnessing now is not a legislative trend\u2014it\u2019s a coordinated nationwide crusade.\n\nIn 2020, most anti-trans legislation centered on banning transgender youth from sports\u2014a proposal that, at the time, was considered extreme. The political optics of attacking LGBTQ+ people so soon after the Obergefell ruling were poor, and the memory of North Carolina\u2019s disastrous bathroom ban was still fresh. That law, which forced trans people to use restrooms that didn\u2019t align with their gender identity, backfired spectacularly and was widely credited with helping sink Republican prospects in the 2018 midterms in the state.\n\nNevertheless, some Republicans had identified sports as a way to get their foot in the door to further discrimination. The president of the American Principles Project, Terry Schilling, detailed how this was the case, \u201cThe women's sports issue was really the beginning point in helping expose all this because what it did was, it got opponents of the LGBT movement comfortable with talking about transgender issues.\u201d\n\nIn the years that followed, the volume and severity of anti-trans legislation escalated dramatically. Over 200 bills were proposed in 2022, and more than 500 in 2023, with each legislative session raising the ceiling on what Republicans considered politically palatable. Sports bans, once fringe, became boilerplate by 2021. The next year, states that had passed sports bans moved swiftly to criminalize gender-affirming care, and drag bans and bathroom restrictions emerged as the new line of attack. Today, those once-extreme measures are commonplace, and Republicans are setting their sights on even broader targets: bans on ID changes, adult healthcare restrictions, and increasingly punitive measures that chip away at the basic legal recognition of trans lives. Some bills have even been proposed to criminalize transgender identities altogether.\n\nAs of 2025, a staggering 867 bills have been introduced targeting transgender people across the United States. Of these, 122 would ban gender-affirming care for some segment of the trans population. Another 77 seek to bar transgender people from certain bathrooms\u2014a threat made more tangible as arrests for alleged \u201cwrong bathroom\u201d usage have begun to mount. Seventy-three bills aim to eliminate legal recognition of transgender people entirely, often by revoking updated driver\u2019s licenses, stripping correct gender markers, and invalidating identification documents. Others target drag (and transgender people dressed in the \u201cwrong clothes\u201d) or require schools to forcibly out transgender students. A newer, especially chilling category would classify gender-affirming care or even social transition as child abuse, opening the door for state-sanctioned removal of trans youth from supportive homes. So far, 51 anti-trans bills have been signed into law this year, with many more advancing through state legislatures.\n\nAs state legislatures escalate their assault on transgender rights, the federal government under Trump has doubled down\u2014punishing blue states for protective laws, banning transgender people from military service, investigating teachers for affirming trans students, defunding hospitals that provide care, and targeting organizations simply for acknowledging the word \u201ctransgender.\u201d In scope and intensity, 2025 has become the most punishing year yet for transgender people in America. The goal is unmistakable: to make it nearly impossible for transgender people to live openly, safely, and with dignity in public life.",

    "full_text": "Inside Democrats\u2019 Reshuffling on Trans Issues Democrats are starting to have serious conversations around how to handle transgender rights politically ahead of next year\u2019s elections \u2014 after, by their own admission, they were caught flat-footed on the issue in 2024.\nThe upshot, so far: Don\u2019t be so dogmatic that you risk alienating voters and allies.\n\nRep. Sarah McBride, the first openly trans member of Congress, and her staff have spoken to her Democratic colleagues about the topic, NOTUS has learned. The Delaware congresswoman has cautioned moderate Democrats that the tenor and tone of their comments \u2014 particularly on questioning trans athletes in sports, which is where most of the debate has focused \u2014 might inflame and splinter factions instead of being productive.\n\n\u201cWe have to create more space in our tent. If, for instance, we want to have a majoritarian coalition \u2014 not just electorally, but specifically on issues around trans rights \u2014 that, by necessity, is going to have to include people who have a range of thoughts,\u201d McBride told NOTUS.\n\n\u201cA binary choice between being all-on or all-off is not constructive for anyone,\u201d McBride continued. \u201cIt impedes the very needed path toward winning electorally, winning hearts and minds and, most importantly, winning progress.\u201d\n\nRepublicans have already clearly signaled their plans to lean on trans issues in next year\u2019s campaigns, after their success in 2024. President Donald Trump said last week that he has directed his party to not bring up trans issues \u201cbecause there is no election right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut about a week before the election, bring it up because you can\u2019t lose,\u201d he told reporters from the Oval Office.\n\nThe Pew Research Center found that Americans\u2019 support for restrictions on trans people increased between 2022 and 2025. For example, 58% of survey respondents in 2022 said they supported requiring trans athletes to compete in sports that \u201cmatch the sex they were assigned at birth.\u201d That increased to 66% in 2025.\n\nIn 2022, 46% of respondents supported making it illegal for health providers to offer gender-affirming care to trans minors. That number rose to 56% in 2025.\n\nSome members \u2014 like Reps. Seth Moulton and Tom Suozzi, both of whom have recently met with McBride \u2014 received immediate intraparty backlash for publicly saying they oppose having trans athletes participate in women\u2019s and girls\u2019 sports. McBride thinks that type of response is unproductive.\n\n\u201cI think it is an incredibly problematic instinct that many have to excommunicate people who aren\u2019t in lockstep with you on every policy, or even aren\u2019t in lockstep with you on the messaging,\u201d she said.\n\nMcBride is by no means the only House member who has been ruminating on the topic.\n\nRep. Greg Landsman, whose district was targeted by House Republicans\u2019 campaign arm, which opposed his support for trans rights, told NOTUS that Democrats are having \u201cvery informal\u201d conversations on the topic.\n\nThey look like, \u201cyou pull somebody aside and you just say, \u2018What do you think?\u2019 or \u2018This is what I\u2019m hearing\u2019 \u2014 how Americans talk. We\u2019re not enacting legislation like [Republicans] are that is intended to just be mean as fuck and it\u2019s not solving problems,\u201d Landsman said.\n\n\u201cI do think there is, on the positive side, a growing appreciation that Democrats could be a little judgy and annoying about this, and maybe we should be open-minded and appreciate that not everyone is where we are,\u201d he continued.\n\nThe conversations were particularly prevalent in January, when the House voted on a bill to ban trans athletes from participating in sports teams of their preferred gender. The bill passed with only three Democrats defecting from the rest of the party. One of those votes came from Rep. Vicente Gonzalez.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had some people be critical of my vote, but I think the vast majority of people in my district agree with me, and I think the vast majority of people around the country do too,\u201d Gonzalez told NOTUS.\n\nThe South Texas congressman said he \u201cspoke to especially front-line battleground members. I told everybody what vote I was going to take before I took it.\u201d Ultimately, only Reps. Henry Cuellar and Don Davis \u2014 to whom Gonzalez confirmed he spoke with beforehand \u2014 joined him in separating from the rest of the caucus. (Cuellar and Gonzalez voted in support, Davis voted present).\n\nHad House Democratic leadership not whipped against the bill (NOTUS viewed the notice sent to congressional offices at the time), Gonzalez said, \u201cI think you would have seen 20 or 30 members vote with us.\u201d\n\nGonzalez told NOTUS that he spoke with caucus leaders, although declined to name who, to demand that leadership not whip future bills that had to do with trans issues. (In response to this, a spokesperson for House Minority Whip Katherine Clark told NOTUS in a statement, \u201cWe don\u2019t disclose conversations with Members regarding our whip strategy.\u201d)\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t agree with whipping those types of votes,\u201d Gonzalez said. \u201cI think everyone should vote their conscience, their ideology, the values of their district, and that\u2019s how we win races.\u201d\n\nClark said in a statement that the \u201cRepublican strategy is to divide Americans instead of bringing the country together around solutions.\u201d\n\nHouse Democrats\u2019 most common messaging strategy on trans issues, advised by McBride after the election, has been to treat Republicans\u2019 anti-trans attacks as a distraction and to pivot to other issues.\n\nMoulton has also been making an effort to ensure the caucus is more receptive to nuanced opinions around trans issues.\n\nIn January, Moulton spoke separately with Rep. Mark Takano, chair of the Congressional Equality Caucus, and Rep. Becca Balint, co-chair of the caucus, about ensuring that the caucus is open to different opinions on trans issues, according to two sources familiar.\n\nBoth lawmakers, one of the sources said, were receptive to Mouton\u2019s stance.\n\nTakano told NOTUS in a statement that a \u201ccritical\u201d part about being Equality Caucus chair is his \u201ccommitment to creating spaces where every Member of Congress can have their genuine questions listened to and answered, without judgment.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe recognize that there is more work to do to win some of the hearts and minds of the general public, given people\u2019s lack of familiarity with the trans community and the prevalence of right-wing anti-trans propaganda and disinformation, and we are working to make sure members have the information and support they need to be that bridge,\u201d Takano added.\n\nSimilarly, Balint said in a statement that \u201cit\u2019s critical to have hard conversations around this, both inside and outside of Congress.\u201d\n\nIn an interview, Moulton told NOTUS that Democrats needed to borrow a page from Republicans\u2019 playbook.\n\nCalifornia's Democratic governor was once considered an LGBTQ+ ally. So, what\u2019s with the heel turn?\n\u201cRepublicans clearly don\u2019t agree on everything, but they\u2019ve succeeded in recent years in broadening their tent so that whether you\u2019re a MAGA Trumper or a much more traditional Republican, you can still get behind the party and they\u2019re not being kicked out,\u201d he said.\n\nThe congressman added, though, that he believes there\u2019s no room within the Democratic Party for views that completely oppose trans rights.\n\n\u201cThat crosses the line of civil rights,\u201d Moulton said.\n\nMoulton, who confirmed that he has spoken with McBride about trans issues, was optimistic about the informal conversations taking place within the caucus. But he added that there haven\u2019t been any broader conversations brought by leadership around how to handle trans issues \u201cbecause people are still scared to have them.\u201d\n\nBut with a broader discussion now taking place among the American public, some Democrats are attempting to slowly start one within the party.\n\n\u201cI do think I understand, as a trans person, how to meet people who aren\u2019t trans where they are, and how to find commonality with people,\u201d McBride said. \u201cPart of that is creating room for a lack of understanding, for disagreement, for grace and, therefore, to create room for growth.\u201d",

    "full_text": "Transgender Military Service Members Remain On Duty: Judge Rules Trump Order Is \u201cSoaked In Animus\u201d and Lacks Evidence to Support Ban A federal court has granted a preliminary injunction blocking implementation of President Trump\u2019s executive order targeting transgender military service members. The 79-page opinion details the lengthy records of service and commendation of the trans plaintiffs, and notes the order\u2019s distinct lack of evidence to support a ban.\n\nThe preliminary injunction was issued in the legal challenge Talbott v. Trump, brought by LGBTQ legal groups GLAD Law and the National Center for Lesbian Rights. They are representing six active service members, two people actively seeking enlistment, and an additional 12 plaintiffs who joined the case since the filing on January 28th.\n\nThe court order detailed the transgender military members\u2019 skills, service, and honors earned:\n\n\u201cTogether they have provided over 130 years of military service. They have served in roles ranging from Senior Military Science Instructor to Artillery Platoon Commander to Intelligence Analyst to Satellite Operator to Operations Research Analyst to Naval Flight Officer to Weapons Officer.\u201d\n\u201cThey have deployed around the globe, from Afghanistan to Poland to Korea to Iraq to Kuwait to the USS Ronald Reagan and USS George W. Bush. One is presently deployed to an active combat zone.\u201d\n\u201cThey have earned more than 80 commendations including: a Bronze Star; two Global War on Terrorism Service Medals; two Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medals; numerous Meritorious Service Medals; numerous Commendation Medals; Air and Space Outstanding Unit Awards; and the Military Outstanding Volunteer Service Medal, among many others. \u201c\n\u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 service records alone are Exhibit A for the proposition that transgender persons can have the warrior ethos, physical and mental health, selflessness, honor, integrity, and discipline to ensure military excellence. Defendants [Trump Department of Justice lawyers] Agree\u201d\nExcerpt\n\nThe ruling noted the lack of evidence to support a ban on transgender military service in the executive order or in the followup memo by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth:\n\n\u201cPresident Trump issued EO14183 seven days after taking office. No one knows what he relied on, if anything.\u201d\n\u201cThere is no evidence that they consulted with uniformed military leaders before doing so. Neither document contains any analysis nor cites any data.\u201d\n\u201cEO14183 and the Hegseth Policy provide nothing to support Defendants\u2019 view that transgender military service is inconsistent with military readiness.\u201d\nThe Court ruled the order violates the equal protection clause of The U.S. Constitution, promotes discrimination based on transgender status and sex, and \u201cis soaked in animus.\u201d\n\nU.S. District Court Judge Ana Reyes continued: \u201cIts language is unabashedly demeaning, its policy stigmatizes transgender persons as inherently unfit, and its conclusions bear no relation to fact.\u201d\n\n\u201cThousands of transgender servicemembers have sacrificed\u2014some risking their lives\u2014to ensure for others the very equal protection rights the Military Ban seeks to deny them.\u201d\n\nThe opinion supported its claim of administration animus with examples of the Trump administration\u2019s targeting of transgender people writ large:\n\n\u201cPlaintiffs are likely to succeed on their claim that the Military Ban is motivated by animus and is not tailored to meet its stated goals. But, as they say, there is more, for the Military Ban does not stand alone.\u201d\nExecutive orders disparaging transgender identity, attempting to block access to health care and education, accurate passports, and censorship on federal websites of accurate terms to describe transgender people including on health agency sites, a \u201cstop bullying\u201d site, the site to protect missing and exploited children, and the National Park Service\u2019s site for the Stonewall National Monument.\n\u201cThe flurry of government actions directed at transgender persons\u2014denying them everything from necessary medical care to access to homeless shelters\u2014must give pause to any court asked to consider whether one such order under review furthers a legitimate government interest free of animus.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re grateful our plaintiffs, and all transgender members of the military, are protected from this egregious ban,\u201d the National Center for Lesbian Rights stated in a post on Bluesky.\n\n\u201cWhen you put on the uniform, differences fall away and what matters is your ability to do the job,\u201d said Nicolas Talbott, Second Lieutenant, Army, whose name is on the lawsuit challenging the order.\n\n\u201cMy being transgender has no bearing on my dedication to the mission, my commitment to my unit, or my ability to perform my duties in accordance with the high standards expected of me and every servicemember,\u201d Lt. Talbott said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve spent more than half my life in the Army, including combat in Afghanistan,\u201d said Kate Cole, Sergeant First Class, Army. \u201cRemoving qualified transgender soldiers like me means an exodus of experienced personnel who fill key positions and can\u2019t be easily replaced, putting the burden on our fellow soldiers left behind. That\u2019s just wrong \u2014 and it destabilizes our armed forces.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis ruling shows the Trump administration\u2019s discriminatory attempt to bar transgender Americans from serving in the military is unconstitutional and does nothing to make our country safer and stronger,\u201d GLAAD President and CEO Sarah Kate Ellis said.\n\n\u201cTransgender military members are already serving capably and honorably, having met the required rigorous health and readiness standards,\u201d Ellis continued. \u201cThe current \u2018commander in chief\u2019 and his staff continue to threaten our national defense with this baseless disinformation campaign against their fellow Americans. Transgender troops should continue to serve despite this politically-motivated and harmful sideshow.\u201d\n\nResearch shows that Trump\u2019s previous ban on trans service had a negative impact on military readiness, unit cohesion, and national security. 56 generals, admirals, and other leaders from every service branch condemned Trump\u2019s previous attempt to bar open service, noting it would \u201cdegrade readiness even more than the failed \u2018don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u2019 policy.\u201d\n\nExcerpt\n\n\u201cThe Court\u2019s opinion is long, but its premise is simple,\u201d the opinion summed up.\n\n\u201cIn the self-evident truth that \u2018all people are created equal,\u2019 all means all. Nothing more. And certainly nothing less.\u201d\n\nThe Court is giving the government until March 21, 2025, at 10:00 am eastern, to file for an emergency stay.\n\n\u201cThe Court extends its appreciation to every current servicemember and veteran. Thank you.\u201d",

Charli XCX also took the stage and welcomed Lorde, Troye Sivan, and Billie Eilish to perform alongside her \u2014 the quad taking this epic photo together: Drag Race alum Trixie Mattel showed off her DJ prowess at the Do LaB and brought special guest, VINCINT on to the stage to perform their recent cover of Mama RuPaul\u2019s \u201cSupermodel (You Betta Work)\u201d. Also making a huge splash the first weekend was Megan Thee Stallion who bought out hip hop royalty Queen Latifah to join her on stage to sing her iconic hit \u201cU.N.I.T.Y.\u201d In addition to the Queen, Megan also got emotional when she danced with Ciara and also got down and dirty with Victoria Monet. Other LGBTQ artists that took the stage or will take the stage this coming weekend include Anitta, Clairo, Japanese Breakfast, Coco & Breezy, Green Day, The Go-Go\u2019s, Hope Tala, Beabadobee, Underscores, Arca, Amyl & The Sniffers, and Desiree.",

Parents and parental rights groups are outraged at a school district in New Jersey over its curriculum on gender identity and are accusing the district of encouraging students to transition.\n\nLawrence Township Public Schools adopted a transgender policy for the current school year like the 600 other districts in New Jersey. Policy 5756 was initially adopted in 2016 and revised three years later. The policy is believed by the district to be mandated by the state, but a clarification issued in April by New Jersey's Education Department says the state \"does not mandate curriculum.\"\n\n\"I'm tired of people hiding behind [state learning standards] as an excuse to teach this far-left agenda, this woke agenda, this agenda that includes gender theory and all this other stuff that confuses our kids,\" parent Robert Pluta, who pulled his children out of the district, told FOX News Digital.\n\nLesson plans, books and assignments on gender identity are part of the district's curriculum.\n\nParents and parental rights groups are outraged at a school district in New Jersey over its curriculum on gender identity. (iStock)\n\n\"This super woke progressive agenda \u2026 it's so saturated with race and sex. And it's just like, can we just get back to teaching? I don't want a conservative school, I don't want a liberal school,\" Pluta said.\n\nThe picture book \"Jacob\u2019s New Dress\" by Ian Hoffman and Sarah Hoffman, which is read to kindergartners, tells the story of a young boy who likes playing dress-up and wants to wear a dress to school, even as his classmates tell him that he cannot wear \"girl\" clothes. Kindergartners also are read \"My Princess Boy\" by Cheryl Kilodavis, which follows a boy who likes \"pretty things\" and prefers to wear tiaras and \"girly dresses.\"\n\nSecond-graders are read \"10,000 Dresses\" by Marcus Ewert, which features a biological boy named Bailey who dreams of wearing extravagant dresses, and \"Red\" by Michael Hall, a story that details how a blue crayon with a red label is facing an identity crisis because the color he identifies as on the inside is not what is seen on his label.\n\nAnd fifth graders are told the story of \"PRIDE: The Story of Harvey Milk and the Rainbow Flag\" by Rob Sanders. Harvey Milk was the first openly gay man to be elected to public office in California.\n\nAnother parent, who also lives in the district and pulled her children from the public school system over a gender identity curriculum, cited a lesson on the \"gender snowperson\" taught to fourth-grade students, who are asked to think of themselves as a \"snowperson\" and play a game where they can choose their gender.\n\n\"My main concern is that they're pushing social transition. The curricula and the policy really promote, they really encourage children to consider social transition,\" the parent, who wished to remain anonymous, told FOX News Digital.\n\nThe parent also explained that there are four steps in gender transition: social transition, puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones and sex reassignment surgery. She said the district defends itself by noting that it does not administer puberty blockers nor use other medical methods of gender transitioning.\n\n\"Once you've led the horse to water, the horse is going to drink,\" she said. \"That is what a lot of parents are so concerned about, that they're actually encouraging it.\"\n\nAt Lawrence Township, there is a \"social justice\" unit under the social studies curriculum on \"Identity/True Self,\" which is taught to students as early as kindergarten. \n\nFifth graders in this unit are taught that \"one of the first steps that all people \u2014 adults or children \u2014 take, if they feel their internal sense of gender and their sex assigned at birth do not match, is to socially transition.\"\n\n\"This means adults and children live their lives in a way that expresses their internal sense of who they are \u2014 their gender identity,\" the unit description states. \"A person may use a new name and/or different pronouns than before. Some might change their gender expression \u2014 wear different clothes or have a new hairstyle. Students usually want to \u2014 and have the right to \u2014 use facilities or join school activities that align with their gender identity.\"\n\nErika Sanzi, the director of outreach for nonprofit parent group Parents Defending Education, told FOX News Digital the curriculum is \"completely inappropriate for elementary schoolers.\"\n\n\"It is based in gender ideology and is no different than a teacher choosing to read from the catechism and telling students everything in it is true,\" she said. \"Perhaps instead of indoctrinating 5-year-olds and 8-year-olds, they could focus on activism-free reading instruction.\"\n\nOther social studies units taught to young school children include \"Skin Color,\" \"Bias/Prejudice\" and \"Being an Ally/Protest.\"\n\nAccording to the district's transgender policy, the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination \"generally makes it unlawful for schools to subject individuals to differential treatment based on gender identity or expression.\"\n\nThe policy also states that the district \"shall accept a student\u2019s asserted gender identity\" and that \"parental consent is not required.\"\n\n\"A student need not meet any threshold diagnosis or treatment requirements to have his or her gender identity recognized and respected by the school district, school or school staff members,\" the policy states. \"In addition, a legal or court-ordered name change is not required. There is no affirmative duty for any school district staff member to notify a student\u2019s parent of the student\u2019s gender identity or expression.\"\nTransgender flag\n\nThe Lawrence Township Public Schools' transgender policy was adopted for the current school year along with the 600 other districts in New Jersey. Policy 5756 was initially adopted in 2016 and revised three years later. (Getty Images )\n\nNew Jersey learning standards explain that a board of education \"shall include instruction on the political, economic and social contributions of persons with disabilities and lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people, in an appropriate place in the curriculum of middle school and high school students as part of the district\u2019s implementation\" of the state's learning standards.\n\nParents have previously criticized the district's school board over the curriculum on gender identity, including at an Oct. 19 school board meeting at which a lawyer for the board said in his interpretation of the law that parents do not have the right to determine what is taught at their children's school. \n\nThe right of parents \"is not to dictate what their children are taught, it is to determine where they attend,\" lawyer John Comegno said at the time.\n\nThe Garden State does not have a school voucher program that would allow parents to use public funds designated for their child's education on tuition for another school.\n\n\"Defenders of the government school monopoly believe they have the right to raise other people's kids in the way they see fit,\" Corey DeAngelis, American Federation for Children's senior fellow and school choice activist, told FOX News Digital. \"It's a deeply flawed philosophical position that most people find backwards. Children do not belong to the government. Parents are in the best position to make education decisions for their own kids and have the fundamental right to do so.\"\nA school classroom with desks and chairs\n\nEmpty classroom in an elementary school. (FNC)\n\n\"The main problem is that the government school system is a one-size-fits-all disaster that will, by definition, never meet the needs of every individual family,\" he added. \"Parents disagree about how they want their kids to be raised and educated \u2013 and that's OK. The problem is that special interests get to dictate how to raise other people's kids in the current system.\" \n\nDeAngelis explained that the \"only way out of this mess through freedom rather than force is to fund students directly and empower families to choose the education providers that best meet their needs and align with their values.\n\n\"At the same time, competition will give public schools an incentive to focus on the basics because most parents want their kids to get an education as opposed to indoctrination.\"\n\nThe district is represented by U.S. Democrat Rep. Andy Kim, who defeated Republican challenger Bob Healey in the midterm elections. Healey told FOX News Digital that Kim \"is as radical as they come on issues involving our kids and our schools.\" \n\n\"He supports sex ed for kindergartners, biological males playing girls sports and thinks parents who attend school board meetings are \u2018extremists\u2019 for simply caring about what their kids are being taught in the classroom,\" Healey said.\n\nKim's office did not respond to a request for comment from FOX News Digital.\nPhoto shows interior of classroom in school with no students present\n\nThe Garden State does not have a school voucher program that would allow parents to use public funds designated for their children's education on tuition for another school. (iStock)\n\nThree Lawrence Township school board members up for re-election \u2014 Pepper Evans, Michelle King and Amanda Santos \u2014 all won last week against challengers critical of the board and the district's curriculum.\n\n\"School choice is the only way to truly secure parental rights in education. New Jersey public schools were funded at over $24,000 per student in 2020,\" DeAngelis said, citing data from the U.S. Census Bureau. \"That money should go directly to families so that they can find the education providers that best meet their children's needs.\"\n\nAttendees of the Oct. 19 school board meeting also saw a Lawrence Township first-grade teacher wearing a \"Columbus Was A Murderer\" T-shirt. This came shortly after Columbus Day and despite New Jersey having a large Catholic population.\n\nThe Lawrence Township Board of Education did not respond to a request for comment from FOX News Digital.",

    "full_text": "Some federal web pages still down as agencies implement order 'defending women' This week, the Trump administration instructed all federal agencies to remove information from their websites pertaining to \"gender ideology.\" On Friday, a flurry of reports indicated that exact thing was happening.\n\nIn a Wednesday memo, Office of Personnel Management Acting Director Charles Ezell instructed agencies to comply by Friday at 5 p.m. ET with an executive order that says its aim is \"defending women from gender ideology extremism.\"\n\nThat memo laid out \"steps to end federal funding of gender ideology.\" Among those was the instruction to \"Take down all outward facing media (websites, social media accounts, etc.) that inculcate or promote gender ideology.\" While \"gender ideology\" is not sharply defined, Trump and other transgender rights opponents have used the phrase to argue against the idea that people can identify with a gender that does not match the sex they were assigned at birth.\n\nIndeed, the executive order calls it a \"false claim that males can identify as and thus become women and vice versa.\" For a time on Friday evening, the entire Census.gov website returned an error message. Attempting to reach the Census Bureau's 2020 Results page showed part of the site was down for maintenance. Its page on sexual orientation and gender identity was still down early Saturday afternoon.\n\nThe examples proliferated on social media, with academics, journalists and activists noting that basic information had disappeared from government websites. The CDC's HIV surveillance data disappeared, as noted by Aaron Richterman, a scientist at the University of Pennsylvania. Similarly, the CDC's Youth Risk Survey data is no longer accessible, which KFF's Cynthia Cox pointed out.\n\n\"OPM sent guidance to agencies to remove gender ideology-related content from their websites by 5 pm today as part of the efforts to defend women and uphold the truth of biological sex against the radical claims of gender activists,\" OPM communications director McLaurine Pinover said in a statement Friday evening. \"This may have been misinterpreted to mean we would shut down government websites who weren't able to comply but that is not the plan for continuing to implement this important effort.\" Many who support transgender rights oppose using the phrase \"gender ideology,\" as it implies that being transgender is a belief system, as opposed to an identity. Nearly 2 million Americans identify as trans or transgender, according to 2023 polling from KFF and Washington Post.\n\nThis week's \"gender ideology\" memo wasn't the only order from the Trump administration to remove information from websites. In another memo implementing an executive order aimed at \"ending radical and wasteful government DEI programs,\" Ezell instructed agencies to \"Take down all outward facing media (websites, social media accounts, etc.) of DEIA offices.\" DEIA stands for \"diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility\" in this order. When asked Friday about the removal of \"DEI\" information from websites, Trump said, \"It doesn't sound like a bad idea to me. DEI would have ruined our country, and now it's dead.\"\n\nThe \"Defending Women\" executive order, and Ezell's resulting memo, go well beyond policing information on government websites. Ezell also instructed agencies to \"review all agency programs, contracts, and grants, and terminate any that promote or inculcate gender ideology,\" and also to make sure that forms ask for respondents' \"sex\" and not their \"gender.\"\n\nThe memo additionally calls on agencies to make sure that \"intimate spaces\" are \"designated by biological sex and not gender identity,\" which could mean transgender and nonbinary employees will be restricted in which bathrooms they use. NPR reached out for clarity on which spaces would be considered \"intimate spaces\" and did not receive a response.",

    "full_text": "Exclusive: Thousands of Coloradans Urge Lawmakers to Reject Radical Transgender Bill Defining Wrong Pronouns as Child Abuse Thousands of Coloradans are reaching out to state lawmakers urging them to vote against a radical transgender bill that would classify \u201cmisgendering\u201d and \u201cdeadnaming\u201d as forms of child abuse that would be considered in child custody disputes.\n\nBy Tuesday, 6,161 Coloradans sent 215,475 emails to Colorado state senators through Heritage Action for America\u2019s Colorado Action Center, Breitbart News exclusively learned. Heritage Action started the Colorado Action Center on April 8 in response to HB25-1312, which passed the state House on April 6 and is currently waiting to be assigned to a Senate committee. \n\n\u201cHeritage Action and our army of grassroots conservatives in Colorado strongly oppose this legislation, which seeks to impose radical gender ideology on families,\u201d Heritage Action Vice President Janae Stracke told Breitbart News in a statement. \u201cThis tidal wave of opposition against this legislation in Colorado highlights how disconnected radical Democrats are from their constituents. This bill is an open assault on parents\u2019 rights and free speech. We urge all Colorado lawmakers to reject this legislation.\u201d\n\nThe bill subscribes to the false idea that one can identify as or become a different sex than they were born as, often called \u201cgender identity.\u201d The bill defines \u201cdeadname\u201d as: \u201cto purposefully, and with the intent to disregard the individual\u2019s gender identity or gender expression, refer to an individual by their birth name rather than their chosen name.\u201d The bill defines \u201cmisgender\u201d as: \u201cto purposefully, and with the intent to disregard the individual\u2019s gender identity or gender expression, refer to an individual using an honorific or pronoun that conflicts with the individual\u2019s gender identity or gender expression.\u201d\n\nAccording to the bill\u2019s summary, the legislation would direct courts making child custody decisions and determining the best interests of a child \u201cfor purposes of parenting time\u201d to consider \u201cdeadnaming,\u201d \u201cmisgendering,\u201d or threatening to publish material related to an individual\u2019s sex change services as types of \u201ccoercive control.\u201d\n\nThe bill would additionally define \u201cdeadnaming\u201d and \u201cmisgendering\u201d as discriminatory acts in the \u201cColorado Anti-Discrimination Act,\u201d which would essentially prohibit calling sex-confused individuals by their real names or biological sex in places of public accommodation.\n\nThe bill would further prohibit Colorado courts from complying with orders or laws from other states mandating that a child be taken from parents or caregivers who allow them access to mutilating sex change drugs and surgeries \u2014 which transgender activists euphemistically call \u201cgender-affirming care.\u201d\n\nThe legislation would direct schools that establish policies related to \u201cchosen names\u201d to include all reasons why a student may choose to go by a name other than their legal name. Schools would also be barred from including rules based on \u201cgender\u201d in dress code policies.\n\nThe bill also directs public entities that require individuals to disclose their names to have options for both legal and chosen names. The public entity would be required to use a chosen name on all subsequent forms if it differs from the individual\u2019s legal name.\n\nThe bill is officially called the \u201cThe Kelly Loving Act,\u201d named after a transgender-identifying man who was killed during the 2022 Club Q shooting in Colorado Springs, according to Colorado Newsline.\n\nDemocrats hold a trifecta in Colorado: they dominate the state House 43-22, the state Senate 23-12, and they hold the governorship with Gov. Jared Polis (D).\n\nDemocrats in the House denied all proposed Republican amendments to the bill and were able to use procedural rules to stymie and ultimately halt debate on the bill before passing it on a Sunday.\n\nDemocrats behind the bill have criticized parental rights groups concerned about the transgender bills, with one even comparing them to the Ku Klux Klan. Democrat state Rep. Yara Zokaie said, \u201cA well-stakeholded bill does not need to be discussed with hate groups, and we don\u2019t ask someone passing civil rights legislation to go ask the KKK their opinion.\u201d\n\nAccording to Heritage Action, \u201cradical gender ideology activists have been working to weaponize Child Protective Services (CPS) against US parents by accusing them of \u2018abuse\u2019 if they do not affirm and recognize their child\u2019s \u2018gender identity.\u201d\u2018\n\n\u201cMultiple states have already passed legislation to criminalize parents through this perverse redefinition of abuse, allowing for the removal of children from the loving homes of \u2018non-affirming parents,'\u201d the organization noted.\n\nHeritage Action says the bill would deny parental rights, violate free speech, harm vulnerable children, and \u201cmandate schools prioritize indoctrination over education.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe ONLY time a state should ever remove a child is for actual abuse, not to impose a destructive ideology. The truth is simple. It is never abuse to raise a girl as a girl or a boy as a boy,\u201d the organization says on its Colorado Action Center page.\n\n\u201cIt is imperative that all Colorado senators hear from their constituents on how this radical bill will tear apart families and harm children across Colorado,\u201d the organization added.",

    "full_text": "House Dems look to expand access to gender-affirming care amid Trump crackdown More than two dozen House Democrats are looking to protect and expand availability to gender-affirming care for transgender youths and adults as the Trump administration takes steps to sharply curb access. \n\nThe Transgender Health Care Access Act, introduced Monday by Rep. Becca Balint (D-Vt.), would establish grants supporting medical education programs and professional training in transition-related care and expand its access in rural communities. Balint introduced the measure on Trans Day of Visibility, recognized annually on March 31 to celebrate the lives and contributions of trans people and draw attention to disproportionate discrimination faced by the community. The bill has nearly 30 Democratic co-sponsors, several of whom, including Reps. Jerry Nadler (N.Y.) and Sara Jacobs (Calif.), are slated to speak at a transgender rights rally Monday evening in Washington. \n\nLGBTQ civil rights groups, including the Human Rights Campaign, the National Center for Lesbian Rights, Advocates for Trans Equality and the ACLU, are also backing the legislation, according to a news release from Balint\u2019s office, though it stands little chance in the GOP-controlled Congress.\n\nIn a statement, Balint, one of 14 openly LGBTQ lawmakers and a member of the Congressional Equality Caucus, which has also endorsed the bill, said the measure is a response to legislation filed disproportionately by Republicans to curb access to care that major medical organizations have said is medically necessary. \n\n\u201cAs Republicans use their power to take away health care and continue to attack and dehumanize trans folks, I\u2019m not standing down. That\u2019s why I\u2019m introducing this bill to expand access and train more providers,\u201d she said. \n\n\u201cRepublicans are obsessed with attacking trans people. It\u2019s dangerous. Over and over again they use messages designed to get Americans to fear one another and to divide us,\u201d Balint added. \u201cBut I want queer and trans Americans to know you have fighters and allies in Congress.\u201d President Trump and his administration have made transgender rights a key target, and half a dozen executive orders signed by the president since his return to office in January directly impact trans Americans. A sweeping order Trump signed during his first hours back in Washington proclaims the government recognizes only two sexes, male and female, and another he signed in February seeks to end federal support for transition-related care for youth. Two federal judges blocked the administration from implementing the latter order. \n\nTrump has also endorsed states\u2019 efforts to heavily restrict or ban access to gender-affirming care for minors and called on Congress this month during a joint address to pass legislation outlawing such care nationwide. \n\nFederal legislation to ban trans health care for youth has been introduced in each of the last two Congresses. The bill\u2019s primary sponsor, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), has not refiled the measure in the current Congress but has said she plans to do so. The 2023 Senate version of Greene\u2019s bill, the Protect Children\u2019s Innocence Act, was sponsored by now-Vice President Vance. \n\nEarlier this month, Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-Texas) reintroduced legislation to block hospitals that provide gender-affirming care to minors from being eligible to participate in the Children\u2019s Hospital Graduate Medical Education Payment program, which funds education and training for pediatric medical residents and fellows. He filed the bill on DeTrans Awareness Day, which recognizes the experiences of individuals who once, but no longer, identified as trans and advocates against transition-related medical care, particularly for minors.\n\nLaws passed in 27 states ban care \u2014 including puberty blockers, hormone therapy and surgery \u2014 for transgender youth. The Supreme Court will decide this summer whether such bans violate the constitution.\n\n",

    "full_text": "SJSU responds to volleyball player mass exodus after trans athlete scandal rocked program San Jose State University has acknowledged a recent mass exodus of volleyball players who entered the transfer portal after a controversy-riddled season involving a trans athlete on the team. \n\nThe university provided a statement to Fox News Digital in which it expressed \"respect\" for the recent wave of players who have opted to transfer. \"Student athletes have the ability to make decisions about their college athletic careers, and we have the utmost respect for that,\" the statement read.\n\nThe San Francisco Chronicle reported that seven of the team's players have entered the transfer portal. \n\nIn an article detailing the San Jose State University Spartans' transgender athlete scandal, the New York Times referred to the biological female athletes on the team as \"non-transgender women.\" (AP Photo/David Zalubowski)\n\nThe seven players who are transferring will be leaving the team after a season that included eight forfeited matches, regular police protection, national scrutiny and internal turmoil between players and coaches. One player even received threats of physical harm amid the controversy.\n\nHead coach Todd Kress even spoke about how the 2024 season was one of the \"most difficult\" of his life after the team's loss in the conference final to Colorado State, in a statement provided to Fox News Digital. \n\n\"This has been one of the most difficult seasons I\u2019ve ever experienced, and I know this is true as well for many of our players and the staff who have been supporting us all along. Maintaining our focus on the court and ensuring the overall safety and well-being of my players amid the external noise have been my priorities,\" Kress said. \n\nThe transgender player, Blaire Fleming, is out of eligibility after completing a fourth collegiate season in 2024. The team's season ended in the Mountain West Conference championship game after it advanced to the title game by virtue of a forfeit from Boise State in the semifinal round. Boise State previously forfeited two regular season games to San Jose State amid the controversy involving Fleming, accounting for three of its seven conference wins via forfeit this year. \n\nA loss to Colorado State in the conference final ended the season and prevented the controversy from slipping into the NCAA tournament. The loss effectively ended Fleming's collegiate career.\n\nIn September, co-captain Brooke Slusser joined a lawsuit against the NCAA alleging the program withheld knowledge about Fleming's birth gender from her and other players on the team. Slusser alleged she was made to share changing and sleeping spaces with Fleming without knowing that Fleming was a biological male. \n\nSlusser, along with several other players in the Mountain West, filed a separate lawsuit against the conference and San Jose State in November over Fleming's presence. That lawsuit included testimony from former San Jose State volleyball players Alyssa Sugai and Elle Patterson alleging they were passed over for scholarships in favor of Fleming. \n\nThat lawsuit also alleges that San Jose State players spoke up about an alleged scheme by Fleming to have Slusser spiked in the face with a volleyball in a game against Colorado State on Oct. 3. Slusser was not spiked in the face in that game, and an investigation by the Mountain West concluded without finding sufficient evidence of the alleged plot.\n\nAssistant coach Melissa Batie-Smoose was suspended by the program in early November after she filed a Title IX complaint against the university for showing favoritism toward Fleming over the other players, especially Slusser. Batie-Smoose's complaint also included allegations of Fleming's plot to have Slusser spiked in the face. \n\nSlusser previously told Fox News Digital that Batie-Smoose's dismissal severely impacted the morale of the team.\n\n\"After we found out that she was released, a lot of the team just kind of broke down and was kind of freaking out, and even one of my teammates was like, \u2018I don\u2019t feel safe anymore,' because there's no one now that we feel like we can go and talk to about our concerns or our actual feelings and can actually speak freely in front of,\" Slusser said.\n\nSlusser added that she and other players lost trust in the coaches, including head coach Kress. \n\n\"You can't truly voice how you're feeling without them just trying to cover it up or act like it's all OK. With Melissa, you could voice how you felt, and she could comfort you and validate your feelings and at least make you feel heard compared to the other coaches,\" Slusser said.\n\nKress also blamed the team that forfeited for igniting backlash against his team, as each forfeit brought about more controversy and media attention.\n\nSan Jose State Spartans players look on prior to the game against the Air Force Falcons at Falcon Court at East Gym on Oct. 19, 2024 in Colorado Springs, Colorado. (Andrew Wevers/Getty Images)\n\n\"Sadly, others who for years have played this same team without incident chose not to play us this season. To be clear, we did not celebrate a single win by forfeiture. Instead, we braced for the fallout. Each forfeiture announcement unleashed appalling, hateful messages individuals chose to send directly to our student-athletes, our coaching staff and many associated with our program.\" \n\nHowever, these issues did not stop the players from at least having some fun on what was their final road trip as San Jose State Spartans for most of them. \n\nSlusser previously told Fox News Digital that the team went out to a magic show together when they traveled to Las Vegas for the Mountain West tournament, and even had a team Thanksgiving meal together at the team hotel with takeout from a local diner with many of their families. \n\nHowever, that was not enough to keep the seven players who have entered the transfer portal attached to the program, as the team will be facing a major roster turnover as it looks to rebound on the court and in its reputation in 2025.

Monday, they will actually be allowing transgender athletes to take part in the women\u2019s division. And to make that even crazier, this is happening even though they already have another category for \u201cnon-binary\u201d people. (RELATED: Teenage Girl Cries While Saying She Was \u2018Traumatized\u2019 By Trans Athlete, School Board Prez Demands Her To \u2018Wrap It Up\u2019)\n\nWell, when a woman competitor spoke out about her concerns on social media regarding the issue, Hiltz tossed insults at her and threw 100% of her support behind biological male athletes.\n\n\u201cAre you gonna win the woman\u2019s division or take prize money? I don\u2019t think so,\u201d said Hiltz in a clip published on Instagram. \u201cSo I don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re upset about? Like, are you mad because instead of 900 you\u2019re gonna take 901st, because a trans woman maybe beats you?\u201d\n\n\u201cThis person forgot what the point of a marathon is. It\u2019s to complete 26.2 miles and maybe make some friends along the way. Trans women are not stopping you from doing that.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s crazy to me that there are women out there who actually think like this \u2026 The West has a serious, serious problem.",

    "full_text": "Trump Isn\u2019t \u2018Denationalizing\u2019 Trans People. He\u2019s Saying No To Their War On Reality Early this week, New York Times opinion columnist Masha Gessen penned a piece purportedly exposing \u201cThe Hidden Motive Behind Trump\u2019s Attacks on Trans People.\u201d Unsurprisingly, the Trump policies Gessen sees as proof of an insidious Trumpian plot are reality-based measures that protect women and children and preserve American culture.\n\nGessen begins her supposed expos\u00e9 by bemoaning the \u201ccurrent, protracted bad-news moment\u201d and its repercussions for her \u201cpersonally\u201d as someone who is \u201ctrans and an immigrant.\u201d She then moves quickly to comparing the United States to Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. As the essay continues, Gessen\u2019s contention becomes clear: Trump\u2019s \u201cbarrage of attacks on trans people\u201d is central to his \u201cdenationalization campaign,\u201d which he pursues ostensibly so he can then deport them or implement a more fiendishly Hitlerian purpose.\n\nGessen likens trans people in America to Jews in Europe during the Holocaust and tells the story of a \u201cnonbinary\u201d friend who felt the need to hide her Star of David necklace when an alleged \u201cattacker\u201d questioned whether she was \u201ca girl or a boy,\u201d implying a link between antisemitism and traditional, biology-based views of sex. In other words, the United States has become like 1930s Germany, and those who refuse to accept the left\u2019s gender ideology are the 21st century\u2019s Nazis.\n\nAs evidence, Gessen cites Trump\u2019s \u201cassert[ion] that only two sexes exist;\u201d \u201cexecutive orders aimed at banning any mention of transgender people in schools, banning trans athletes from women\u2019s sports, ordering a stop to gender-affirming medical care for people under 19 and barring trans people from serving in the military;\u201d the elimination of the \u201cX\u201d designation on U.S. passports; and \u201cvisa guidelines\u201d that require the sex designation on a person\u2019s passport to match that on his birth certificate, among others.\n\nIn other words, from Gessen\u2019s perspective \u2014 and apparently that of The New York Times \u2014 the most compelling evidence that the Trump administration is an authoritarian regime akin to the Third Reich or the Soviet Union is its acknowledgment of biological and cultural realities and moral laws. Gessen characterizes Trump\u2019s acceptance of the fact that \u201conly two sexes exist: male and female, established at conception and immutable\u201d as an assertion that \u201ctrans people \u2026 do not exist.\u201d Trump referencing Payton McNabb and her being injured by a trans-identifying male during his joint address to Congress is an attack on trans people. (Gessen downplays the injury by asserting that \u201cserious volleyball injuries are surprisingly common,\u201d though evidence suggests that volleyball is one of the safer sports.)\n\nWhile Gessen may believe her own fearmongering, her conspiracy theory is ridiculous and unfounded. (Perhaps Gessen\u2019s conspiratorial thinking should be unsurprising, given that she actually suggested that Kamala Harris\u2019 refusal to double down on pro-trans policies cost her the election.) U.S. citizens who identify as transgender, nonbinary, and so forth (and so forth, as the identities multiply) are in no danger of being deported or alienated from society. Trump isn\u2019t denying the existence of people who claim to be transgender; he\u2019s just stating the fact that such people do not transcend the biological and cultural realities of male and female.\n\nThe whole trans-activist accusation of existence-denial is nonsensical in any case: It\u2019s fairly obvious that if a man claims to be a \u201csmart scientist\u201d and another man disagrees with him, he\u2019s denying the man\u2019s claim, not his existence (otherwise, whose claim is he disagreeing with?). A female who switches from identifying as male to identifying as nonbinary didn\u2019t commit suicide.\n\nDespite Gessen\u2019s protests and all the headlines implying that Trump is kicking trans people out of sports, no Trump policy does any such thing. Those who claim to be transgender are allowed to play sports with other people of the same sex \u2014 just like everyone else. A boy can try to look, act, and sound like a girl and still play sports \u2014 on the boys\u2019 sports teams.\n\nWhen it comes to passports, Gessen seems to ignore the fact that passports (and other forms of ID) have photographs for identification purposes, not just an M for male or an F for female. Passport photos are supposed to be recent when submitted, but they can be updated to reflect a drastic change in appearance, rendering the objection to the removal of the X designation a red herring. If all else fails, the individual can simply explain why his passport says he is male but he is attempting to look like a woman (an uncomfortable conversation for some, perhaps, but one that was chosen by the individual identifying as transgender). Trump isn\u2019t prohibiting the travel of people like Gessen.\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s common sense policies are simply a reflection of the truth that government has a role in preserving culture (or, in the case of the Biden administration, destroying it). That role exists even if it is as limited as ensuring that the passports it issues tell the truth about the carrier\u2019s sex instead of legitimizing his confusion. Viewed through this lens, the policies Gessen decries have nothing to do with targeting those who claim to be transgender \u2014 and certainly nothing to do with \u201cdenationalizing\u201d them \u2014 and everything to do with acknowledging the truths about reality that form the bedrock of this nation and its cultural norms.\n\nTrans activists, on the other hand, are perfectly willing to destroy America\u2019s cultural fabric in order to replace it with their own distorted framework \u2014 a framework in which the concepts of male and female exist, not as biological and cultural realities established by a Creator, but as malleable categories whose primary purpose is transgender cosplay. Gessen herself argued that the institution of marriage should be done away with in 2012, in part because marriage wasn\u2019t \u201ccompatible\u201d with her relationship arrangement. (Her \u201cnew partner\u201d at the time had just given birth to her brother\u2019s child, among other \u201cincompatibilities.\u201d)\n\nA more recent example of trans anarchism was brought to light by an Illinois mother who claimed that her 13-year-old daughter\u2019s school made female students undress in front of a male student. Trans activists booed the mother for speaking out at a school board meeting, and the school disputes the mother\u2019s claim. But even if the mother\u2019s story were completely false, that wouldn\u2019t change the fact that schools requiring girls to undress in front of boys (or men) is exactly what trans anarchists want \u2014 the total obliteration of boundaries and norms rooted in immutable distinctions between male and female.\n\nTrump opposes this imposition of cultural anarchy. His resistance is not based on a desire to render those who claim to be transgender nationless, but, apparently, on a recognition that this cultural anarchy if left unchecked will ultimately lead to the demise of the nation all Americans call their home. Thus Trump\u2019s emphasis in his joint address to Congress on the realities that a person is either male or female and \u201cevery child\u201d is \u201cperfect exactly the way God made\u201d him or her. Gessen and those who share her belief system are in no danger of losing their country, but all Americans are in danger of having it undermined by a radical trans agenda that brooks no dissent.\n\nInterestingly, in a 2023 interview with the New Yorker, Gessen discussed her parents\u2019 response to her using a boy\u2019s name and telling them she planned \u201cto have an operation when I grow up.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy parents, fortunately, were incredibly game. They were totally fine with it,\u201d Gessen said.\n\nTrump isn\u2019t \u201cdenationalizing\u201d trans people. He\u2019s simply telling radical trans activists what Gessen\u2019s parents should have told her a long time ago: No.",

    "full_text": "Fact Sheet: Debunking \u201cTrans Terrorism\u201d and Other False Claims in High-Profile Crimes Social media accounts with a history of anti-transgender rhetoric frequently and falsely accuse transgender people of crimes, particularly during mass shooting events, before facts are known.\nThere is no evidence of escalating violence committed by LGBTQ people. Extremism and domestic terrorism experts tell PolitiFact that there are no widespread threats of growing radicalization or violence from the transgender population.\nAccusing people from a small and vulnerable community of mass shooting crimes is an effort to further dehumanize, demonize, and promote fear about transgender and nonbinary people. \nDespite being less than 2% of the U.S. adult population, transgender people are four times as likely to be victims of crime. GLAAD\u2019s ALERT Desk has tracked more than 2,100 anti-LGBTQ incidents from June 2022 \u2013 December 2024, including 750+ incidents specifically targeting transgender and nonbinary people.\nBaseless claims about a suspect\u2019s gender identity circulate while there\u2019s national attention on the event, but before there are confirmed key details. When evidence is released showing the suspect was cisgender, inaccurate posts about the suspect\u2019s transgender identity often remain up and continue spreading unverified, dangerous tropes.\nFar-right extremism is increasing and surpasses terrorism committed by others, Politifact reports. These groups tend to engage in violence that often targets LGBTQ people, and promotes anti-LGBTQ views.\nA 2023 Reuters Fact Check confirms that mass shootings, for example, are overwhelmingly carried out by cisgender men in the U.S.\nTERMS TO AVOID:\n\n\u201cTrans Terrorism\u201d \u2013 There is no evidence that one\u2019s transgender or nonbinary identity fuels extremist attacks or leads to violence.\nSee also and avoid: \u201cTrans Terror,\u201d \u201cTrans Violence,\u201d \u201cTrantifa.\u201d",

Male,\u201d the actor said, holding his passport up for the camera.\n\nElsewhere in the video, Schafer explained, \u201cI went to the federal passport agency today in L.A. \u2014 I\u2019ve had to do this one time before, no part of the process was different.\u201d\n\n\u201cI filled everything out, just like I normally would,\u201d the Hunger Games star added. \u201cI put female, and when it was picked up today \u2014 they had changed the marker to male.\u201d\n\nThe actor then went on to talk about how \u201cprivileged\u201d he is for being \u201cfamous,\u201d \u201cwhite,\u201d and \u201cconventionally\u201d beautiful.\n\n\u201cI want to acknowledge my privilege, like, not only as a, like, famous, like, celebrity trans woman who is white, and thin, and can adhere to, like, contemporary beauty standards, and I can participate in all of that, and I pass \u2014 and it still happened,\u201d Schafer said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t give a fuck that they put an \u2018M\u2019 on my passport. It doesn\u2019t change, really, anything about me or my transness,\u201d the Cuckoo star continued.\n\nSchafer went on to claim that his passport listing him as male makes \u201clife a little harder.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt does make life a little harder,\u201d the actor said. \u201cI\u2019ll find out next week when I have to travel abroad for the first time with my new passport.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s going to come along with having to out myself to, like, border patrol agents and that whole gig much more often than I would like to,\u201d Schafer \u2014 who is perhaps best known for playing a high school boy posing as a girl in HBO\u2019s Euphoria \u2014 claimed.\n\nSchafer also asserted that \u201ctrans people are beautiful. We are never going to stop existing. I\u2019m never going to stop being trans.\u201d\n\n\u201cA letter on a passport can\u2019t change that,\u201d the actor declared, adding, \u201cFuck this administration.\u201d",

    "full_text": "EXCLUSIVE: Trump Launches Investigation Into Colleges Over Transgender Fencing Scandal WASHINGTON\u2014A special administration task force formed by President Donald Trump has launched investigations into the University of Maryland and Wagner College after they failed to protect a female athlete penalized for refusing to compete against a male who identifies as a female, The Daily Wire can first report.\n\nThe Title IX Special Investigations Team \u2014 a joint Education Department and Justice Department project \u2014 launched a directed investigation Monday into the University of Maryland over allegations that it not only allowed a male athlete to compete in the women\u2019s category of the USA Fencing Tournament, but also allowed that male athlete to use women\u2019s-only intimate facilities. \n\nThe Special Investigations Team is also investigating Wagner College for its own practices and polices that allegedly allowed that male to compete in female sports and to use female intimate spaces.\n\nBoth colleges received letters from the Title IX Special Investigations Team on Monday, The Daily Wire has learned.\n\nREAD THE LETTERS TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND AND WAGNER COLLEGE\n\nOfficials black-carded and booted 31-year-old Stephanie Turner from a tournament at the University of Maryland for refusing to compete against Redmond Sullivan, a male who identifies as a woman and who formerly competed against males. USA Fencing allowed Sullivan, who competes for Wagner College, to compete in the women\u2019s tournament, the organization confirmed to The Daily Wire.\n\n\u201cThe nation watched as a female competitor bravely took a knee and forfeited an inherently unfair fencing match after discovering that her opponent was a male,\u201d Education Department spokeswoman Julie Hartman told The Daily Wire. \u201cNo woman should have to recuse herself from a match that she trained diligently for because she fears for her safety.\n\n\u201cAs a tournament host, University of Maryland has a responsibility to follow Title IX by not allowing males to compete in female competitions and occupy female-only intimate facilities,\u201d Hartman said. \u201cSimilarly, Wagner College has a responsibility to not allow males on female rosters.\u201d\n\nThe University of Maryland had a responsibility to follow Title IX by not allowing men to compete in female competitions or be in women\u2019s spaces, the Education Department is alleging, arguing that Wagner College also had a responsibility to protect female sports from males.\n\n\u201cUnlike the Biden administration, which weaponized Title IX contrary to its meaning to deny female athletes their civil rights, the Trump Administration\u2019s Department of Education and the Department of Justice\u2019s Title IX Special Investigations Team will not allow recipients of federal funding to deny women\u2019s equal opportunity protections under the law,\u201d Hartman said. \n\nTrump signs the \u201cKeeping Men Out of Women\u2019s Sports\u201d executive order (Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)\n\u201cI want to thank God for trusting me with this mission to fight for female exclusive sports and putting me in a place to effectively protest,\u201d Turner told The Daily Wire in a statement in early April. During the competition, she took a knee and forfeited the match to her male opponent.\n\nAbout a week after the incident, Wagner College confirmed to Fox News Digital that the male athlete is no longer on its women\u2019s team.\n\nThe Trump administration created the Title IX Special Investigations Team after receiving a \u201cstaggering volume\u201d of Title IX complaints. Both the Education and Justice Departments have been vocal about Title IX situations in California, Maine, and other states.\n\nThe agencies repeatedly point to Trump\u2019s executive orders protecting female student athletes from having \u201cto compete with or against or having to appear unclothed before males,\u201d as well as Trump\u2019s order \u201cDefending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism.\u201d \n\n\u201cUnder the Biden administration, Title IX was weaponized contrary to its meaning to deny women their equal opportunity protections under the law,\u201d Hartman told The Daily Wire earlier this month. \u201cSchools allowed male competitors to strip female athletes of their rightful accolades, threaten women\u2019s safety, and subject them to the indignity of unfair competitions.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn America, this is the women\u2019s rights issue of our time,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd the Trump administration will fight relentlessly to protect them.\u201d",

    "full_text": "Which US companies are pulling back on diversity initiatives? A growing number of prominent companies have scaled back or set aside the diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives that much of corporate America endorsed following the protests that accompanied the Minneapolis police killing of George Floyd, a Black man, in 2020.\n\nThe changes have come in response to a campaign by conservative activists to target workplace programs in the courts and social media, and more recently, President Donald Trump\u2019s executive orders aimed at upending DEI policies in both the federal government and private sector.\n\nDEI policies typically are intended to root out systemic barriers to the advancement of historically marginalized groups in certain fields or roles. Critics argue that some education, government and business programs are discriminatory because they single out participants based on factors such as race, gender and sexual orientation. They have targeted corporate sponsorships, employee-led affinity groups, programs aimed at steering contracts to minority or women-owned businesses, and goals that some companies established for increasing minority representation in leadership ranks. While hiring or promotion decisions based on race or gender is illegal under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act in most circumstances, companies say they are not doing that. Instead, they say they aspire to diversify their workforce over time through policies like widening candidate pools for job openings.\n\nThese are some of the companies that have retreated from DEI: Uber\nAfter an conducting an internal investigation that found rampant sexual harassment issues within its corporate office under its founder and former CEO Travis Kalanick, Uber has been focused on overhauling its corporate culture since its current CEO Dara Khosrowshahi took over in 2017.\n\nThose changes had included a ramped-up commitment to diversity and inclusion as part of a commitment that the ride-hailing service highlighted in a section of its annual report for 2023.\n\nBut Uber dropped its diversity and inclusion section from its 2024 annual report filed last month. And the word \u201cdiversity\u201d doesn\u2019t appear anywhere in its 135 pages.\n\nUber didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment Friday.\n\nSalesforce\nSalesforce CEO Marc Benioff once was on a crusade to inspire other corporate leaders to become social activists in a drive to fix a \u201ctrain wreck\u201d of inequality, but he has since toned down that message while pledging to work with President Donald Trump \u201cto drive American success and prosperity for all.\u201d\n\nAlthough Benioff personally has remained an outspoken supporter of LGBTQ+ rights, Salesforce is no longer touting its diversity program. After carving out a section of its annual report filed last year to declare, \u201cEquality, Diversity and Inclusion Equality is a core value at Salesforce,\u201d the San Francisco excluded any discussion of diversity programs in its latest annual report filed March 5.\n\n\u201cWhile we don\u2019t have representation goals, we remain committed to our value of equality,\u201d Salesforce said in a statement.\n\nPepsi\nPepsiCo confirmed that it\u2019s ending some of its diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, even as rival Coca-Cola voiced support for its own inclusion efforts.\n\nIn a memo sent to employees, PepsiCo CEO Ramon Laguarta said the company will no longer set goals for minority representation in its managerial roles or supplier base. The company will also align its sponsorships to events and groups that promote business growth, he said.\n\nLaguarta wrote that inclusion remains important to PepsiCo, whose brands include Gatorade, Lay\u2019s potato chips, Doritos, Mountain Dew as well as Pepsi. The Purchase, New York-based company\u2019s chief diversity officer will transition to a broader role focused on employee engagement, leadership development and ensuring an inclusive culture, he said.\n\nGoldman Sachs\nInvestment firm Goldman Sachs confirmed that it was dropping a requirement that forced IPO clients to include women and members of minority groups on their board of directors.\n\n\u201cAs a result of legal developments related to board diversity requirements, we ended our formal board diversity policy,\u201d said a Goldman Sachs spokesman in an email to The Associated Press. \u201cWe continue to believe that successful boards benefit from diverse backgrounds and perspectives, and we will encourage them to take this approach.\u201d\n\nGoldman Sachs said that it will still have a placement service that connects its clients with diverse candidates to serve on their boards. \nGoogle\nGoogle rescinded a goal it had set in 2020 to increase representation of underrepresented groups among the company\u2019s leadership team by 30% within five years. In a memo to employees, the company also said it was considering other changes in response to Trump\u2019s executive order aimed at prohibiting federal contractors from conducting DEI practices that constitute \u201cillegal discrimination.\u201d\n\nGoogle\u2019s parent company Alphabet also signaled things were changing in its annual 10-K report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The report dropped a boilerplate sentence it has used since 2020 declaring that the company is \u201ccommitted to making diversity, equity, and inclusion part of everything we do and to growing a workforce that is representative of the users we serve.\u201d\n\nTarget\nThe retailer said that changes to its \u201cBelonging at the Bullseye\u201d strategy would include ending a program it established to help Black employees build meaningful careers, improve the experience of Black shoppers and to promote Black-owned businesses following Floyd\u2019s death in Minneapolis, where Target has its headquarters.\n\nTarget, which operates nearly 2,000 stores nationwide and employs more than 400,000 people, said it also would conclude the diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, goals it previously set in three-year cycles.\n\nThe goals included hiring and promoting more women and members of racial minority groups, and recruiting more diverse suppliers, including businesses owned by people of color, women, LGBTQ+ people, veterans and people with disabilities.\n\nTarget also will no longer participate in surveys designed to gauge the effectiveness of its actions, including an annual index compiled by the Human Rights Campaign, a national LGBTQ+ rights organization. Target also said it would further evaluate corporate partnerships to ensure they\u2019re connected directly to business objectives, but declined to share details.\n\nMeta Platforms\nThe parent company of Facebook and Instagram said it was getting rid of its diversity, equity and inclusion program, which featured policies for hiring, training and picking vendors.\n\nLike other companies that announced similar changes before Meta, the social media giant said it had been reviewing the program since the Supreme Court\u2019s July 2023 ruling upending affirmative action in higher education.\n\nCiting an internal memo sent to employees, news website Axios reported the Menlo Park, California-based tech giant said it would no longer have a team focused on diversity and inclusion and will instead \u201cfocus on how to apply fair and consistent practices that mitigate bias for all, no matter your background.\u201d The change means the company will also end its \u201cdiverse slate approach\u201d to hiring, which involved considering a diverse pool of candidates for every open position.\n\nAmazon\nAmazon said it was halting some of its DEI programs, although it did not specify which ones. In a Dec. 16 memo to employees, Candi Castleberry, a senior human resources executive, said the company has been \u201cwinding down outdated programs and materials, and we\u2019re aiming to complete that by the end of 2024.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe also know there will always be individuals or teams who continue to do well-intentioned things that don\u2019t align with our company-wide approach, and we might not always see those right away. But we\u2019ll keep at it,\u201d she wrote.\n\nRather than \u201chave individual groups build programs,\u201d Castleberry said, Amazon is \u201cfocusing on programs with proven outcomes \u2013 and we also aim to foster a more truly inclusive culture.\u201d\n\nMcDonald\u2019s\nMcDonald\u2019s said on Jan. 6 that it would retire specific goals for achieving diversity at senior leadership levels. It also planned to end a program that encouraged its suppliers to develop diversity training and to increase the number of minority group members represented within their own leadership ranks.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s later said it was changing \u2014 but not eliminating \u2014 a scholarship program for Latino students after it was sued by a group that opposes affirmative action. The program will now be open to any student who can demonstrate an impact on the Latino community, the fast-food giant said. Applicants no longer need to have at least one Latino parent.\n\nIn an open letter to employees and franchisees, McDonald\u2019s senior leadership team said it remained committed to inclusion and believes that having a diverse workforce is a competitive advantage. The company said it would continue to publicly report its demographic information and spending on diverse-owned suppliers.\n\nWalmart\nThe world\u2019s largest retailer confirmed in November that it would not be renewing a five-year commitment to a racial equity center set up in 2020 after the police killing of George Floyd, and that it would stop participating in the HRC\u2019s Corporate Equality Index.\n\nWalmart also said it will better monitor its third-party marketplace to make sure items sold there do not include products aimed at LGBTQ+ minors, including chest binders intended for transgender youth.\n\nAdditionally, the company will no longer consider race and gender as a litmus test to improve diversity when it offers supplier contracts and it won\u2019t be gathering demographic data when determining financing eligibility for those grants.\n\nFord\nCEO Jim Farley sent a memo to the automaker\u2019s employees in August outlining changes to the company\u2019s DEI policies, including a decision to stop taking part in HRC\u2019s Corporate Equality Index.\n\nFord, he wrote, had been looking at its policies for a year. The company doesn\u2019t use hiring quotas or tie compensation to specific diversity goals but remains committed to \u201cfostering a safe and inclusive workplace,\u201d Farley said.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to put our effort and resources into taking care of our customers, our team, and our communities versus publicly commenting on the many polarizing issues of the day,\u201d the memo said.\n\nLowe\u2019s\nIn August, Lowe\u2019s executive leadership said the company began \u201creviewing\u201d its programs following the Supreme Court\u2019s affirmative action ruling and decided to combine its employee resource groups into one umbrella organization. Previously, the company had \u201cindividual groups representing diverse sections of our associate population.\u201d\n\nThe retailer also will no longer participate in the HRC index, and will stop sponsoring and participating in events, such as festivals and parades, that are outside of its business areas.\n\nHarley-Davidson\nIn a post on X in August, Harley-Davidson said the company would review all sponsorships and organizations it was affiliated with, and that all would have to be centrally approved. It said the company would focus exclusively on growing the sport of motorcycling and retaining its loyal riding community, in addition to supporting first responders, active military members and veterans.\n\nThe motorcycle maker said it would no longer participate in the ranking of workplace equality compiled by the HRC, and that its trainings would be related to the needs of the business and absent of socially motivated content.\n\nHarley-Davidson also said it does not have hiring quotas and would no longer have supplier diversity spending goals.\n\nBrown-Forman\nThe parent company of Jack Daniels also pulled out from participating in the HRC\u2019s Corporate Equality Index, among other changes. Its leaders sent an email to employees in August saying the company launched its diversity and inclusion strategy in 2019, but since then \u201cthe world has evolved, our business has changed, and the legal and external landscape has shifted dramatically.\u201d\n\nThe company said it would remove its quantitative workforce and supplier diversity ambitions, ensure incentives and employee goals were tied to business performance, and review training programs for consistency with a revised strategy.\n\n\u201cBrown-Forman continues to foster an inclusive work environment where everyone is welcomed, respected, and able to bring their best self to work,\u201d spokeswoman Elizabeth Conway said in an email.\n\nJohn Deere\nThe farm equipment maker said in July that it would no longer sponsor \u201csocial or cultural awareness\u201d events, and that it would audit all training materials \u201cto ensure the absence of socially-motivated messages\u201d in compliance with federal and local laws.\n\nMoline, Illinois-based John Deere added \u201cthe existence of diversity quotas and pronoun identification have never been and are not company policy.\u201d But it noted that it would still continue to \u201ctrack and advance\u201d the diversity of the company.\n\nTractor Supply\nThe retailer in June said it was ending an array of corporate diversity and climate efforts, a move that came after weeks of online conservative backlash against the rural retailer.\n\nTractor Supply said it would be eliminating all of its DEI roles while retiring current DEI goals. The company added that it would \u201cstop sponsoring non-business activities\u201d such as Pride festivals or voting campaigns \u2014 and no longer submit data for the HRC index.\n\nThe Brentwood, Tennessee-based company, which sells products ranging from farming equipment to pet supplies, also said that it would withdraw from its carbon emission goals to instead \u201cfocus on our land and water conservation efforts.\u201d\n\nThe National Black Farmers Association called on Tractor Supply\u2019s president and CEO to step down shortly after the company\u2019s announcement.\n\n",

OCR under this Administration has moved faster than it ever has, and the Title IX SIT will ensure even more rapid and consistent investigations.\u201d",

Melle addressed the inmate as \u201cmister\u201d and \u201che\u201d without knowing he identified as female.\n\nMelle said she called the patient a male when discussing with another medical professional about the need for a male catheter to be removed.\n\n\u201cThis was a real-life medical scenario that required accurate terminology to avoid any doubt between medical professionals,\u201d she said.\n\nThe patient overheard this conversation, and that\u2019s when he became enraged.\n\nWhen she did so, Patient X took issue, and Melle told him that she could not refer to him with female pronouns because \u201cit\u2019s against my faith and Christian values but I can call you by your name.\u201d The patient then allegedly began an angry and aggressive tirade against Melle, calling her the \u201cn-word\u201d three times.\n\n\u201cImagine if I called you n*****? How about I call you n*****? Yes, black n*****,\u201d the patient yelled, according to the outlet\u2019s review of Melle\u2019s lawsuit.\n\nThe patient also lunged at Melle despite being restrained and threatened to file a complaint against her, Melle alleged in her lawsuit.\n\n\u201cIt was terrifying. I\u2019d never been called that word before. And I thought I was going to be attacked,\u201d she told the outlet.\n\nDespite the patient\u2019s outburst and alleged attack, it was Melle who suffered the consequences. She was investigated and disciplined by her hospital in October 2024, and received a final warning and a referral to the Nursing and Midwifery Council, the Telegraph reported. Last month, she received a letter from that Council, saying it was assessing her ability to continue practicing as a nurse.\n\nThe Council\u2019s code of conduct tells nurses they cannot \u201cexpress your personal beliefs (including political, religious or moral beliefs) in an inappropriate way.\u201d The Council told Melle that, although she \u201cfelt unable to identify Patient X using the preferred pronouns due to her religion\u2026 it could be perceived that [Ms Melle\u2019s] actions could\u2026 be seen as a potential breach of the code.\u201d\n\nMelle said in her lawsuit that she did not believe she violated the Council\u2019s code and noted that a white colleague also called the patient a male but was not investigated or disciplined. She believes her Christian beliefs could be to blame.\n\n\u201cEver since I have expressed my Christian beliefs under extreme pressure, I have been a marked woman,\u201d she said, according to the Telegraph.",

    "full_text": "Trump\u2019s Executive Order Ends \u2018Trans\u2019 Tyranny and Protects Females  Thanks to Donald Trump\u2019s new executive order, entitled \u201cDefending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government,\u201d the federal government is no longer coming after you for not recognizing \u201ctranswomen\u201d as women or \u201ctransmen\u201d as men in schools, workplaces, and public accommodations.\n\nThis is a major about-face from the Biden\u2013Harris administration\u2019s insidious promotion of all things \u201ctrans,\u201d endangering children (indoctrination, chemical castration, \u201ctrans\u201d mutilation surgery), females (privacy and safety), and faithful Christians everywhere (mandatory speech requirements in employment and education).\nTrump\u2019s Fidelity to His Election Promise\n\nTrump was true to his commitment over a year ago to work against the \u201cleft-wing gender insanity being pushed on our children [which] is an act of child abuse\u201d and \u201cto stop the chemical, physical, and emotional mutilation of our youth.\u201d The executive order fleshed out what was arguably the greatest line in his Inaugural Address: \u201cAs of today, it will henceforth be the official policy of the United States government that there are only two genders, male and female.\u201d\n\nThis one action alone justifies the outcome of the election (there are, of course, other reasons) because the eradication of any non-circular definition of \u201cwoman\u201d and \u201cman\u201d (or \u201cmale\u201d and \u201cfemale\u201d) does inestimable damage to this most essential element of human civilization.\nDescription of the Problem for Women\n\nThe opening \u201cPurpose\u201d section artfully summarizes the problem by presenting it as a problem for women: \u201cIdeologues who deny the biological reality of sex have \u2026 used \u2026 coercive means to permit men to \u2026 gain access to intimate single-sex spaces \u2026 designed for women\u2026. This is wrong.\u201d Such efforts \u201cattack women by depriving them of their dignity, safety, and well-being.\u201d Moreover, \u201cbasing Federal policy on truth is critical to scientific inquiry, public safety, morale, and trust in government itself.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s executive order rightfully pinpoints the locus of confusion as \u201creplacing the immutable biological reality of sex with an internal, fluid, and subjective sense of self unmoored from biological facts.\u201d The sad result is that laws originally designed to protect women are perverted to \u201cundermine them, replacing longstanding, cherished legal rights and values with an identity-based, inchoate social concept.\u201d\n\nIn order to preserve the original intent of legislation to protect women, the government has no choice but to revert back to a biologically based definition of what a woman is and what a man is. \u201cAccordingly, my Administration will defend women\u2019s rights and protect freedom of conscience by using clear and accurate language and policies that recognize women are biologically female, and men are biologically male.\u201d\nDefinition of \u201cSex\u201d and of \u201cMale\u201d and \u201cFemale\u201d\n\nThe second section of \u201cPolicy and Definitions\u201d pulls the rug out from under the house of cards that stand atop \u201cgender ideology\u201d and \u201cgender identity\u201d by re-establishing a secure basis for \u201csex.\u201d\n\nUnder Trump\u2019s watch, the federal government will no longer define a \u201cmale\u201d and \u201cfemale\u201d by subjective identity but solely by objective biological identity, i.e., by gametes or reproductive function. \u201c\u2018Female\u2019 means a person belonging, at conception, to the sex that produces the large reproductive cell [i.e., egg cell or ovum]. \u2018Male\u2019 means a person belonging, at conception, to the sex that produces the small reproductive cell [i.e., the sperm cell].\u201d\nImpact on Federal Law and Policy\n\nSections 3 through 8 largely spell out the practical effects on federal policy and regulations of reverting back to biologically objective definitions of \u201csex\u201d that are based on male-female reproductive complementarity.\n\nPerhaps the biggest hit was rescinding part of Biden\u2019s executive order, which had redefined the prohibition of \u201csex discrimination\u201d in Title IX of the Educational Amendments Act to include not only \u201csexual orientation discrimination\u201d but also \u201cgender identity discrimination.\u201d In schools that receive federal funding, males will no longer be allowed into female restrooms, locker rooms, female living facilities, and sports (the latter two were still being worked on at the time of the Biden administration\u2019s revisions to Title IX in April 2024).\n\nBiden\u2019s Title IX executive order had recently faced challenges. With lawsuits from 26 Republican attorneys general, the Biden administration\u2019s revision of Title IX was on hold in their states. Earlier this month, a federal judge ruled that Biden\u2019s revision was unconstitutional. Last week, the House of Representatives passed a bill prohibiting men from competing in women\u2019s school sports. It now goes to the Senate.\n\nAlso according to Trump\u2019s new executive order, as regards facilities that receive federal funding, \u201cmales are not [to be] detained in women\u2019s prisons or housed in women\u2019s detention centers\u201d or allowed into female-only \u201crape shelters.\u201d And, \u201cno federal funds are [to be] expended for any medical procedure, treatment, or drug for the purpose of conforming an inmate\u2019s appearance to that of the opposite sex.\u201d\n\n\u201cIntimate spaces designated for women, girls, or females (or for men, boys, or males) are [to be ] designated by sex and not identity.\u201d This would include, of course, restrooms, locker rooms, and showers.\n\n\u201cAgencies shall remove all \u2026 regulations \u2026 that promote or otherwise inculcate gender ideology\u2026. Agencies shall take all necessary steps \u2026 to end the Federal funding of gender ideology,\u201d including in federal grants. \u201cGovernment-issued identification documents, including passports, visas, and Global Entry cards, [shall] accurately reflect the holder\u2019s sex,\u201d as also all \u201capplicable personnel records.\u201d\n\nAll federal guidance publications from previous administrations inconsistent with this new executive order are to be immediately rescinded, including (here I offer a selection of a much fuller list than in the executive order): \u201cThe White House Toolkit on Transgender Equality\u201d; \u201cCreating Inclusive and Nondiscriminatory School Environments for LGBTQI+ Students\u201d; \u201cSupporting LGBTQI+ Youth and Families in School\u201d; \u201cSupporting Intersex Students\u201d; \u201cSupporting Transgender Youth in School\u201d; \u201cConfronting Anti-LGBTQI+ Harassment in Schools\u201d; \u201cEnforcement of Title IX \u2026 With Respect to Discrimination Based on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in Light of Bostock v. Clayton County\u201d; \u201cEnforcement Guidance on Harassment [of LGBTQI+ Persons] in the Workplace\u201d (April 29, 2024).\n\nIn addition, the attorney general is charged with issuing \u201cguidance to ensure the freedom to express the binary nature of sex and the right to single-sex spaces in workplaces and federally funded entities covered by the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\u201d Presumably, this would include protection for teachers in schools who decline to use \u201ctrans\u201d pronouns for students, teachers, and staff.\n\nUndoubtedly, this executive order will be challenged in the courts, especially in relation to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Bostock v. Clayton County (2020), which addressed Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. This underscores the importance of strong court appointments. The executive order would not affect areas over which the federal government does not have authority. But it is an excellent start to the Trump administration.",

    "full_text": "Transgender Miss Maine Contestant Will Face Off Against Bill Belichick\u2019s Girlfriend Jordon Hudson A transgender Miss Maine USA contestant will face off against Jordon Hudson, the 24-year-old girlfriend of head football coach at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and former New England Patriots head coach, Bill Belichick.\n\nIsabelle St. Cyr, a 24-year-old male who identifies as female, is set to compete in the Miss Maine USA pageant next month in Portland, Maine, making the contestant the first transgender individual to go for the title, according to a report by Bangor Daily News.\n\nSt. Cyr told the newspaper he is \u201ca little nervous\u201d to compete in the beauty pageant due to the current political climate, but claimed he did not enter the competition to make a political statement, and signed up a year ago.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just doing it because I love pageants and I just happen to be trans,\u201d St. Cyr said. \u201cI want to show everyone that trans women absolutely can do this pageant and can do well.\u201d\n\nThe trans contestant also claimed there is \u201ca lack of education surrounding the pageant and how welcoming they truly are now.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve opened up and changed the organization for the better, which is why I feel so proud to be with this organization rather than some others that maybe aren\u2019t so open and welcoming to all women,\u201d St. Cyr said.\n\nNotably, Bill Belichick\u2019s girlfriend, Jordon Hudson, will also be competing for the 2025 Miss Maine USA title.\n\n\u201cHappy International Pageant Day,\u201d Hudson wrote in an Instagram post last week, adding, \u201cI couldn\u2019t think of a better day to share with the world that I will be competing for Miss Maine USA 2025; representing my hometown, Hancock.\u201d\n\nMiss Maine USA, which operates under the Miss Universe Organization, reportedly changed its rules in 2012 to allow men to complete.\n\nContestants \u201cmust represent and warrant that you are a female\u201d and be \u201crecognized medically and legally as a female in the United States\u201d in order to participate, according to Miss Maine USA\u2019s website.\n\nSt. Cyr told Bangor Daily News that he believes this means every contestant\u2019s birth certificate must list them as female, and transgender contestants will have to work with a doctor to get their documents changed.\n\nWhile the trans contestant is the first man to compete for Miss Maine USA, he is not the only male to participate in a national pageant.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported, Kataluna Enriquez, a biological male who identifies as a woman, won the title of Miss Nevada USA in 2021.\n\nNotably, St. Cyr\u2019s entry into the pageant arrives during President Donald Trump\u2019s second term in the White House.\n\nOn Friday, President Trump\u2019s Department of Education (DOE) announced that it has begun the process of cutting federal K-12 funding to Maine, as the Democrat-run state continues to allow males who identify as females to compete in girls\u2019 and women\u2019s sports.",

    "full_text": "AG Bondi Says Case of Federal Judge Blocking NH Parents from Protesting Trans Athletes Is Under Review Attorney General Pam Bondi has ordered the Department of Justice (DOJ) to review a case of New Hampshire parents being blocked from protesting transgender athletes.\n\nBondi on Wednesday announced on X that she has asked the DOJ\u2019s Civil Rights Division to \u201cexamine\u201d the case, after a federal judge on Monday barred the parents from wearing pink wristbands that say \u201cXX\u201d in reference to female sex chromosomes. \n\n\u201cI have asked my Civil Rights Division to examine this matter. This DOJ stands with women and their supportive parents,\u201d Bondi said in response to a post from women\u2019s sports advocate Riley Gaines about the case. \n\nIn September, several parents wore pink wristbands with \u201cXX\u201d on them as a sign of protest during a girls\u2019 high school soccer game where trans-identifying male athlete Parker Tirrell, now 16, was playing on the other team.\n\nBow and Dunbarton School Districts Superintendent Marcy Kelley responded to the wristbands by issuing a notice of trespass against the parents, including Antony and Nicole Foote, Kyle Fellers, and Eldon Rash, according to local media reports. The no-trespass order has since expired. \n\nThe parents subsequently sued the school district, alleging that their First Amendment rights had been violated and asking the judge to allow them to carry signs and wear wristbands featuring \u201cXX\u201d at school events while the case is ongoing.\n\nU.S. District Court Judge Steven McAuliffe, a President George H. W. Bush appointee, ultimately sided with the school district and said it acted reasonably in preventing parents from protesting.  \n\n\u201cWhile plaintiffs may very well have never intended to communicate a demeaning or harassing message directed at Parker Tirrell or any other transgender students, the symbols and posters they displayed were fully capable of conveying such a message,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAnd, that broader messaging is what the school authorities reasonably understood and appropriately tried to prevent.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe broader and more demeaning/harassing message the School District understood plaintiffs\u2019 \u2018XX\u2019 symbols to convey was, in context, entirely reasonable,\u201d he continued. \n\nA senior attorney for the Institute for Free Speech, one of the attorneys representing the parents, said he disagrees with the court\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cThis was adult speech in a limited public forum, which enjoys greater First Amendment protection than student speech in the classroom,\u201d attorney Del Kolde said in a statement. \u201cBow School District officials were obviously discriminating based on viewpoint because they perceived the XX wristbands to be \u2018trans-exclusionary\u2019.\u201d\n\nPlaintiffs filed a notice following the ruling saying they do not plan to enter more evidence before the judge issues a final decision, according to the report. \n\nPresident Donald Trump notably signed an executive order on \u201cKeeping Men out of Women\u2019s Sports\u201d which seeks protect female student athletes from having \u201cto compete with or against or having to appear unclothed before males.\u201d The order also mandates each federal department \u201creview grants to education programs and, where appropriate, rescind funding to programs that fail to comply with the policy established in this order,\u201d which protects women \u201cas a matter of safety, fairness, dignity, and truth.\u201d",
