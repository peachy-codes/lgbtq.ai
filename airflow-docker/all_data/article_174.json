About two thirds, 66% of swing voters, said so as well.\n\nEven 60% of women, who consistently lean Democrat, agreed they do not want tax dollars going toward medical \u201cgender transitions.\u201d\n\nMajorities of black and Hispanic Americans, parents as well as unmarried men and women, and urban and suburban voters agreed as well, the poll showed.\n\n\u201cThis poll is proof of what we\u2019ve known for a long time \u2013 the majority of Americans do not want their tax dollars being spent on gender transitions,\u201d Terry Schilling, president of the American Principles Project, said in a statement to The Daily Wire.\n\n\u201cI am glad that President Trump has already begun to take action on this popular, commonsense policy, but now it\u2019s time for Congress to make the ban on federal funding for gender transitions permanent,\u201d Schilling said.\n\nGender ideology in schools, transgender drugs and surgeries on minors, trans-identifying males in women\u2019s sports and prisons all became hot button issues during the election cycle.\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s most effective campaign ad in the past election cycle highlighted Harris\u2019 support for taxpayer-funded transgender medical services for prisoners.\n\n\u201cKamala is for they/them. President Trump is for you,\u201d the ad said.\n\nThe ad aired across the nation, including during football games. Trump advisors said the message reached suburban women, who were also being hammered with Democrats\u2019 aggressive abortion ads.\n\nDemocrats are struggling to find a cohesive messaging strategy after they were walloped in the November election, losing every swing state to Trump.\n\nHowever, some Democrats are already reading the room. California Governor Gavin Newsom backed away from his previous embrace of transgender issues on his podcast last month, calling men in women\u2019s sports \u201cdeeply unfair.\u201d",
