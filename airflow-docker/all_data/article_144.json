  "content": "Following Pope Francis\u2019 death this week at age 88, Catholics around the world (and LGBTQ+ people affected by the Church\u2019s doctrine) are wondering who will take his place. Among the reported frontrunners is Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle, a close ally and advisor to Francis who could become the first Filipino Pope in history \u2014 and potentially continue in the spirit of Francis\u2019 fraught relationship with LGBTQ+ rights. Indeed, in the somewhat ironic Conclave-inspired social media discourse around the selection of the next pope, Tagle has emerged as a queer favorite.\n\nBorn in the Philippines in 1957, Tagle first entered the priesthood in 1982 and became a bishop in 2001. He went on to serve as the Archbishop of Manila from 2011 to 2020, and was elevated to Cardinal by Pope Benedict XVI in 2012 \u2014 the seventh Filipino to be named a cardinal in Church history, as Rolling Stone Philippines reported this week. Tagle later became Prefect of the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples in February 2020, and Francis elevated Tagle to Cardinal-Bishop of San Felice da Cantalice a Centocelle in Rome that May, making him the first Filipino clergymember to be granted the Church\u2019s highest (sub-papal) rank. From 2015 to 2022, Tagle was also the president of Caritas Internationalis, the umbrella network of international Catholic aid and development organizations.\n\nTagle was frequently compared to Francis after the latter became Pope in 2013. Like Francis, Tagle\u2019s humbler tendencies, like riding public transportation, set him apart from other Catholic leaders. Some in the Philippines described Tagle as \u201cunassuming\u201d and \u201capproachable\u201d in remarks to the BBC in 2013, when Tagle was already considered a contender for the papacy.\n\nTagle also shared with Francis a somewhat sympathetic view of LGBTQ+ people, whom he acknowledged had been mistreated by the Church. \u201c[T]he harsh words that were used in the past to refer to gays and divorced and separated people, the unwed mothers, et cetera, in the past they were quite severe,\u201d Tagle told a Catholic youth conference in London in 2015. \u201cMany people who belonged to those groups were branded and that led to their isolation from the wider society.\u201d In 2017, Tagle reportedly led a Catholic social media initiative for Easter in the Philippines called the \u201cLazarus Project,\u201d using the hashtag \u201c#ResurrectLove\u201d to call for LGBTQ+ acceptance in churches. And in 2019, Tagle called on Catholic youth to stop discriminating against or \u201clabeling\u201d LGBTQ+ people, asking them instead to use \u201cyour vocation, your talents, and your uniqueness [...] for the greater glory of God, not against other people or society.\u201d\n\nBut also like Francis, Tagle largely adheres to Church doctrine on topics like homosexuality and same-sex marriage. In 2015 he said that \u201cthe sacrament of reconciliation\u201d \u2014 the formal term for Catholic confession \u2014 allows for \u201cindividual persons and individual cases [to be] taken uniquely or individually\u201d and be embraced by the Church; in other words, Catholics should be more welcoming and compassionate to LGBTQ+ people, but not because being gay isn\u2019t a sin. Tagle likewise backed up Francis\u2019 remarks in the Pope\u2019s January 2015 visit to Manila, where Francis warned against \u201cideological colonization\u201d by secular support for same-sex marriage, abortion, and contraception, which he said would \u201cdestroy\u201d Catholic families.\n\n\u201cPaul VI was courageous [...] he warned his sheep about the wolves that were approaching,\u201d Francis said in part, referencing Pope Paul VI\u2019s ban on contraception. Tagle later called Francis\u2019 remarks \u201ca stroke of genius,\u201d adding that Francis \u201caffirmed the teaching of Paul VI regarding the openness of the family to life [\u2026] but then he reminded all us, too, that Pope Paul VI was very sensitive to particular cases.\u201d In remarks to reporters, Tagle added that African bishops had told him foreign aid to their countries was sometimes conditional on accepting \u201calien\u201d views, i.e. support for same-sex marriage and LGBTQ+ identities, according to the Catholic News Service.\n\nAs Archbishop of Manila, Tagle was a major voice in the Church\u2019s opposition to the Philippines\u2019 Responsible Parenthood Act of 2012, which made sex education in schools compulsory and promised free access to contraception. Tagle told the BBC in 2015 that \u201c[t]he question is how do we teach people how to be responsible parents\u201d rather than allowing easier access to contraception \u2014 though again, Tagle encouraged compassion for individual people, saying that \u201cwe have to be sensitive, pastorally, to the difficulties that persons and families face.\u201d\n\nThe pontiff established himself as one of the most progressive in the Church's history.\nBut Tagle also holds hardline views on abortion, which is heavily criminalized across the Philippines. In 2016, Tagle equated abortion to the ascendant Duterte regime\u2019s killings of thousands of people, alleged to be connected to the drug trade. \u201cMany are worried [about] extrajudicial killings, and we should be [...] But I hope we're also worried about abortion,\u201d Tagle said during remarks to the Catholic radio station Radio Veritas in August 2016. \u201cWhy are only [a] few people speaking out against abortion? That's also murder!\u201d\n\nTagle may not ascend to the papacy himself, of course; there are several other cardinals who might be selected for the job, such as Polish Cardinal Konrad Krajewski, Francis\u2019 head of the Dicastery for the Service of Charity and the man who delivered aid to struggling trans sex workers during the earliest months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Whoever the College of Cardinals selects when the white smoke flies, even the best-case scenario for the next Pope will \u2014 as the old joke goes \u2014 still be Catholic.",
