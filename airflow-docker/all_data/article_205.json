Through the smog that occurs when the air quality index is 484 (\u201cmore than 30 times the maximum level deemed healthy\u201d), I watched from our vehicle\u2019s window as a half dozen trans-identifying adults surrounded and harassed a family in their car next to us, forbidding them to move forward as traffic crept along.\n\nIn the back seat, a woman held a toddler close to her and desperately pleaded with the people surrounding their car to let them proceed. Meanwhile, the transgender mob remained in place and demanded money as they yelled expletives at the family and laughed.\n\nThe woman had made the simple mistake of feeling sympathy and offering money to one of them while her car was stopped at a traffic light, apparently signaling to the others nearby that they were a soft target for extortion. Our local tour guide, Naveen, informed us that the group likely would not let that car go until its members had collected a satisfactory amount of money for each person around the car. Naveen also noted that such incidents involving aggressive transgender mobs are commonplace in Delhi.\nBiden\u2019s United States Is the Surrounded Car in Delhi\n\nThese scenes on the streets of Delhi encapsulate what we have been experiencing in the United States on a grand scale. Morally relativistic, the trans activist population \u2014 which notably does not include all trans-identifying people \u2014 is strategically weaponizing kindness to extort their fellow Americans at the expense of women\u2019s rights, parents\u2019 rights, and religious freedoms.\n\nAmericans tend to agree that bullying is wrong and value a \u201clive and let live\u201d society. But a tyrannical minority pushed a conversation that started as a plea for liberty into something much different. The trans cult, made up of mostly bored white women, is an extremely small segment of the American population with a disproportionately loud voice.\n\nMeanwhile, the majority of Americans believe that \u201cgender is determined by sex at birth,\u201d and they overwhelmingly oppose mutilative surgeries and medical interventions for children.\n\nBut before Americans knew what was happening, between 2019 and 2023, nearly 14,000 children in the United States underwent transgender interventions. Meanwhile, the trans activists continue to insist on the gender ideology indoctrination of our children in public schools, a takeover of women\u2019s sports and bathrooms, and compelled speech with mandated pronouns.\n\nFor years, anyone who questioned or publicly disagreed with this agenda was villainized, and in some cases, canceled.\nThe Trans Cult Can Never Get Enough\n\nThe multitude of days and months celebrating transgenderism was not enough for the alphabet people. So, multiple governing bodies at all levels, including the Biden administration, explicitly commemorated Easter as \u201cTransgender Visibility Day.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, at the White House, a transgender flag was featured more prominently than the American flag at a \u201cpride\u201d event on June 10, 2023. And at that particular event, a transgender influencer decided the White House was an appropriate place to expose fake breasts, which was just one more way for Biden to let us know that, without a doubt, the inmates were running the asylum.\n\nAnd let us not forget the debacle of the Biden administration\u2019s DEI political appointments, some of whom were chosen for their transgender identity in spite of their obvious mental health problems. Sam Brinton, for example, who identifies as \u201cnon-binary\u201d and was likely picked to be a Biden senior Department of Energy nuclear official because of that identification, was traveling at the taxpayers\u2019 expense and stealing luggage from airports.\nMoving Forward\n\nMuch like the sympathetic family in the surrounded car in Delhi, Americans are a kind people. Even in our most populated cities, we offer directions to strangers when asked and tend to value kindness above most other traits. But to people who have an agenda and seem to lack a moral code, kindness is easily exploited.\n\nMoving forward, we would do well to follow Naveen\u2019s advice. He suggested that while in India, we should avoid eye contact with the transgender mob, vendors, and beggars and go about our business.\n\nJust like the trans mob in Delhi, narcissistic trans activists in the United States have proven that they will exploit us and take attention and resources at the expense of all other groups. It is time for us to push their absurd activist agenda out of our schools, bathrooms, and sports and then roll forward.",
