Deerfield is a suburb of Chicago. Georgas said her daughter came home upset on February 5, saying a boy was using the girl\u2019s bathroom.\n\nAccording to Georgas, the girl was then told by school administrators that the boy was allowed to use the girl\u2019s locker room and bathroom because he identified as a girl, and the school\u2019s \u201cinclusive\u201d bathroom policy allowed him to use whichever locker room he wanted. Georgas said she spoke to school administrators and told them they were violating President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order that prohibited males from using female locker rooms and participating in girls\u2019 sports. The school stood its ground, citing the district\u2019s legal counsel.\n\nAfter this exchange, Georgas said Thursday, \u201cthe situation went from bad to worse.\u201d\n\n\u201cA few days later, the male student was present in the girl\u2019s locker room. Feeling violated, the girls made the choice not to change into their PE clothes with the biological male student present,\u201d Georgas said.\n\nThe mother said that school administrators then supervised the girls\u2019 locker room to make sure that the girls changed their clothes in front of the transgender-identifying boy without protest. She identified the district\u2019s assistant superintendent for student services, the school\u2019s assistant principal, and the director for student services as the administrators who forced the girls to change in front of the boy, according to the Lake County Gazette.\n\n\u201cThe girls just want their privacy and they want their locker room back,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are gender neutral options. This is my daughter\u2019s story, and the story of many other young girls who have been forced at the difficult age to do something they know and most adults know is wrong.\u201d\n\nGeorgas\u2019 story received boos from transgender activists in attendance at the school board meeting, including one transgender-identifying person who also happens to have a child identifying as transgender.\n\n\u201cThe discomfort or privacy concerns of other students, teachers, or parents are not valid reasons to deny or limit the full and equal use of those facilities based on a student\u2019s gender-related identity,\u201d said the activist, who serves as the director of operations for Trans Up Front, an activist organization. \u201cInstead, any student, teacher or other individuals seeking more privacy should be accommodated by providing that individual with a more private option.\u201d\n\nGeorgas said she filed a civil rights complaint with the Justice Department.",
