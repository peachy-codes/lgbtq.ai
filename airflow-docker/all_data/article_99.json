In a single week, Meta modified major sections of its Hateful Conduct policy (to allow anti-LGBTQ rhetoric, and remove protections for LGBTQ users); terminated its Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) programs; deleted trans and nonbinary themes on Messenger; and ended its fact-checking program. These striking announcements follow years of imperfect, but visible LGBTQ inclusion from Meta, the parent company of Instagram, Facebook, and other platforms.\n\nResponse from GLAAD\u2019s Social Media Safety Program:\n\u201cWith these changes, Meta and Mark Zuckerberg are now not only permitting and encouraging, but engaging in anti-LGBTQ hate speech \u2014 by intentionally employing anti-LGBTQ language (\u201ctransgenderism\u201d) in the company\u2019s own hate speech policy and instituting new policies permitting extreme anti-LGBTQ slurs (\u201ctr*nny\u201d),\u201d said a GLAAD spokesperson. \u201cThis is a complete break with best practices in content moderation and squarely moves the company into the territory of Truth Social and other extreme right-wing platforms that are unsafe for youth and advertisers. Platforms that encourage anti-LGBTQ hate and violence and other strains of general extremist rhetoric.\u201d\n\nGLAAD President and CEO Sarah Kate Ellis today responded to the latest developments:\n\u201cMeta\u2019s sweeping, hate-driven corporate policy and product changes this week are shocking and dangerous. The company\u2019s litany of dangerous actions is unprecedented. In one week, they have dismantled an entire history of brand-safety best practices, consumer trust, and most importantly, user safety. These changes will harm users and make Meta\u2019s platforms unsafe for everyone. Meta is now an anti-LGBTQ company.\u201d\n\nAs reported by several media outlets, many of these changes originated from new Meta Global Policy Chief Joel Kaplan. These moves follow Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s statements and actions, including Zuckerberg\u2019s $1M donation to the incoming administration, seeking an active role in the Trump administration, and mischaracterizing these egregious company changes as a stance against \u201ccensorship\u201d following Trump\u2019s election in 2016.\n\nOn Tuesday, GLAAD responded after Meta removed and adapted several sections of its Hateful Conduct Policy, rolling back safety guardrails for LGBTQ people, people of color, women, immigrants, and other protected groups. These changes are in addition to news this week that Meta will end its fact-checking program. Read GLAAD\u2019s full analysis here.\n\nTimeline of Meta\u2019s anti-LGBTQ actions this week:\n\nOn Friday, Axios reported that Meta is terminating its Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) programs. Meanwhile, Zuckerberg appeared on right-wing commentator Joe Rogan\u2019s show announcing the widespread changes, and promoting the disproven narrative that conservative accounts are unfairly \u201ccensored.\u201d\nOn Friday, The New York Times reported that there will no longer be any Meta teams devoted to DEI, goals for hiring women and minorities, nor a diversity preference for working with outside, minority-owned supplier businesses.\nOn Friday, 404 Media reported that Meta deleted trans and nonbinary themes on Messenger.\nOn Thursday, The Intercept and Platformer leaked excerpts from new training materials for now-allowable content, which include dehumanizing attacks on LGBTQ people and many other marginalized groups. In the materials, Meta states that \u201ctr*nny\u201d is no longer a designated slur and is now non-violating. When used in a derogatory way, \u201ctr*nny\u201d is an extreme slur for a trans person. Note: Meta spelled out this slur in its communications. See GLAAD\u2019s Fact Sheet, which explains why this word is a slur and why we recommend media not repeat it without an asterisk.\nExamples in the training materials for content moderators include: \u201cTrans people are mentally ill,\u201d \u201cA trans person isn\u2019t a he or she, it\u2019s an it,\u201d and \u201cGet these tr*nnies out of my school (beneath a photo of high school students).\u201d Note: in this example, Meta also did not modify the slur with an asterisk.\nOn Thursday, 404 Media reported that, among LGBTQ and ally employees, the changes have \u201csparked widespread backlash at the company.\u201d\nOn Tuesday, Meta announced that it is ending its fact-checking program, and the company removed and adapted major sections of its Hateful Conduct policy\nThe updated policy now allows \u201callegations of mental illness or abnormality when based on gender or sexual orientation, given political and religious discourse about transgenderism [sic] and homosexuality [sic].\u201d Note: \u201ctransgenderism\u201d a right wing neologism intended to imply that being trans is an ideology, and \u201chomosexuality\u201d is an outdated and pathologizing way of referring to LGBTQ people. Meta has not previously used these terms in public policies or communications.\nIn recent weeks, Meta made several executive personnel changes, including installing Joel Kaplan as Global Policy Chief, Dustin Carmack (former Project 2025 and Ron DeSantis staffer) as Director of Public Policy, and UFC head Dana White on its board of directors.\nThe new language of Meta\u2019s Community Standards includes numerous changes that will result in Instagram, Facebook, and Threads becoming unsafe landscapes filled with dangerous hate speech, violence, harassment, and misinformation. This week, Platformer spoke to 10 current of former employees, who said that the changes would likely lead to substantial increases in hate speech.\n\nExperts in trust and safety and extremism are increasingly examining the connections between online hate and real-world violence. GLAAD\u2019s ALERT Desk has tracked more than 2,100 anti-LGBTQ incidents from June 2022 \u2013 December 2024, including 750+ incidents specifically targeting transgender and non-binary people.\n\nAs highlighted in GLAAD\u2019s 2024 Social Media Safety Index (SMSI) report, Meta\u2019s Facebook, Threads, and Instagram are largely failing to mitigate dangerous anti-LGBTQ hate and disinformation. In August 2024, GLAAD and Media Matters for America found 100 Meta posts with the anti-trans slur \u201ctr*nny.\u201d Even after the content was escalated to Meta\u2019s team, the company chose to not remove the majority of the posts (even though the posts objectively violated its policies). In March 2024, GLAAD released a report that found Meta is largely failing to moderate extreme content targeting trans people.",
