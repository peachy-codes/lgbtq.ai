  "content": "A female nurse in England is suing after she says she was investigated and disciplined by her hospital for accidentally addressing a trans-identifying male pedophile as \u201cmister.\u201d\n\nJennifer Melle, 40, was treating the criminal, referred to as Patient X by media outlets, after he was sent to the St. Helier Hospital in Carshalton, Surrey, from a men\u2019s prison to receive treatment for a urinary problem, The Telegraph reported. Melle addressed the inmate as \u201cmister\u201d and \u201che\u201d without knowing he identified as female.\n\nMelle said she called the patient a male when discussing with another medical professional about the need for a male catheter to be removed.\n\n\u201cThis was a real-life medical scenario that required accurate terminology to avoid any doubt between medical professionals,\u201d she said.\n\nThe patient overheard this conversation, and that\u2019s when he became enraged.\n\nWhen she did so, Patient X took issue, and Melle told him that she could not refer to him with female pronouns because \u201cit\u2019s against my faith and Christian values but I can call you by your name.\u201d The patient then allegedly began an angry and aggressive tirade against Melle, calling her the \u201cn-word\u201d three times.\n\n\u201cImagine if I called you n*****? How about I call you n*****? Yes, black n*****,\u201d the patient yelled, according to the outlet\u2019s review of Melle\u2019s lawsuit.\n\nThe patient also lunged at Melle despite being restrained and threatened to file a complaint against her, Melle alleged in her lawsuit.\n\n\u201cIt was terrifying. I\u2019d never been called that word before. And I thought I was going to be attacked,\u201d she told the outlet.\n\nDespite the patient\u2019s outburst and alleged attack, it was Melle who suffered the consequences. She was investigated and disciplined by her hospital in October 2024, and received a final warning and a referral to the Nursing and Midwifery Council, the Telegraph reported. Last month, she received a letter from that Council, saying it was assessing her ability to continue practicing as a nurse.\n\nThe Council\u2019s code of conduct tells nurses they cannot \u201cexpress your personal beliefs (including political, religious or moral beliefs) in an inappropriate way.\u201d The Council told Melle that, although she \u201cfelt unable to identify Patient X using the preferred pronouns due to her religion\u2026 it could be perceived that [Ms Melle\u2019s] actions could\u2026 be seen as a potential breach of the code.\u201d\n\nMelle said in her lawsuit that she did not believe she violated the Council\u2019s code and noted that a white colleague also called the patient a male but was not investigated or disciplined. She believes her Christian beliefs could be to blame.\n\n\u201cEver since I have expressed my Christian beliefs under extreme pressure, I have been a marked woman,\u201d she said, according to the Telegraph.",
