  "content": "On March 4, for the second time since the start of the 2025 state legislative session, over 200 hundred LGBTQ Georgians and their allies descended on the State Capitol in downtown Atlanta as at least seven anti-LGBTQ bills inched closer to becoming law.\n\n\u201cPride to the Capitol\u201d included more than a dozen LGBTQ equality groups from across the state along with the Human Rights Campaign to help everyday citizens mobilize their messages and meet with lawmakers to share their stories. The event wrapped with a rally at Liberty Plaza and a press conference inside the Capitol. The day-long action arrived just before Crossover Day on March 6, which marks the deadline for bills to pass in at least one chamber to have a chance of becoming law.\n\n\u201cPride to the Capitol\u201d served as a direct response to what advocates described as a \u201ctsunami of anti-trans hate\u201d from Georgia lawmakers who made restricting the civil rights of transgender Georgians a day-one legislative priority.\n\n\u201cThis is not a time to sit on our hands,\u201d said DeMarcus Beckham, Macon-based Regional Organizer for HRC and rally host. \u201cWe need people who are willing to confront those bullies across the street [inside the State Capitol]. We don\u2019t need any more allies; we need accomplices.\u201d\n\nThe stakes couldn\u2019t have been more precise for Danieelle, a transgender woman at the rally who requested to only be identified by her first name out of fear for her safety. She tells GLAAD she is often overwhelmed by the level of hatred directed at the transgender community by elected officials.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really depressing that it\u2019s 2025, and this is still where we are,\u201d Danieelle said. \u201cTo have it directed at you personally is really scary. You want to think about leaving the country, but then you also want to stick up for people you know who can\u2019t stand up for themselves,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWhether it is intentional or just complete ignorance, they should understand that they represent us\u2014Georgians,\u201d Beckham said as he looked out into the crowd with signs that read \u201cEquality Now\u201d and \u201cHuman.\u201d\n\nAs the rally commenced, so did the advancement of SB 36, a bill proponents say is necessary to protect religious rights, while LGBTQ advocates warned it would be a license to use religious belief to discriminate against LGBTQ people and other marginalized groups. The bill passed along party lines in a 32-23 vote in the Senate on Tuesday as LGBTQ advocates inside and outside the Capitol appealed to lawmakers to resist curtailing LGBTQ progress.\n\nOut legislator, Sen. RaShaun Kemp (D-South Fulton), told The AJC that Georgians already have religious freedom. The only thing the \u201cbill does is use their religion as a free pass to discriminate.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I go to church with my husband and my two kids, I get to worship and praise God with no limitations, and you can actually do the same,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen this political playbook before,\u201d Rep. Sam Park (D-107) said inside the statehouse during the press conference. Park is also an out Georgia legislator.\n\n\u201cWhen politicians fail to address the real challenges that Georgians face, like the skyrocketing cost of living, a broken healthcare system, and a need for better economic opportunities, they look for scapegoats instead of doing the work to solve real problems affecting every Georgian.\u201d\n\nTransgender advocate, rally speaker, and history-making Miss Georgia contestant Bella Bautista defiantly echoed the sentiments of Park, Kemp, and hundreds of LGBTQ people inside Liberty Plaza.\n\n\u201cThey want us to believe that being our authentic self is too much; too controversial, too political,\u201d Bautista said. \u201cBut here\u2019s the truth: I am not a controversy. I am not a debate. I am living proof that we belong. They may try to silence us, but you cannot silence a movement.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere have been moments where I questioned my place in a world that has often tried to erase us; erase Black men, erase Black trans men, men like me,\u201d said Dr. Elijah Nicholas, founder and executive director of The Global Trans Equity Project and a rally speaker.\n\n\u201cFor every single step I\u2019ve taken\u2014every moment of doubt\u2014every triumph has taught me one thing: I am here. I am worthy. And I am not invisible,\u201d Nicholas said.\n\nFor James Waldrop, 80, being present and visible at the rally held a significant meaning as a queer man who came of age and into the awareness of his sexual orientation and gender identity during the Silent Generation. Waldrop tells GLAAD that for 70 years, he has lived a \u201cfeminine life inside a male body.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am who I am, no matter what I look like. And that\u2019s why I say my sexual orientation is not a threat to anyone. And anyone\u2019s sexual orientation should not be a threat to any other,\u201d Waldrop said.\n\nWaldrop says the current political climate has forced him out of his comfort zone.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been pushed to the point that I can no longer sit and not participate,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to be heard, so the only way to be heard is to be out and present, and that\u2019s what I want to be.\u201d\n\nThe same is true for Aeden Rowell, 22, a transgender man and Duluth, GA resident who shared his story during the press conference of being raised in conservative Jackson County, GA, in a religious family who were members of the same Episcopal church as Gov. Brian Kemp.\n\n\u201cI played the role that was expected of me, but like any performance that lasts too long, it drained me,\u201d Rowell said.\n\n\u201cMy religious community support gave me the strength to get me through a difficult time in my life. But that support alone could not change the way I saw myself in the mirror. I needed medical care, life-saving care, gender-affirming care, so when I looked at my reflection, I saw the person who I knew I always was,\u201d he added.\n\nRowell had one question for lawmakers inside the Capitol working to convince their colleagues and Georgians that his existence as a transgender person poses a threat.\n\n\u201cI ask you this: think about someone in your life who you love. If they came out to you as transgender, how would you react?\u201d We are your friends. We are your neighbors. We are your children. We sit beside you in church pews, in classrooms, in communities with you across this state. We are not a threat, but right now, our lives are under threat,\u201dRowell said.\n\nStill, according to Jeff Graham, executive director of Georgia Equality, there is reason for hope.\n\n\u201cChange happens all the time. And change will happen for the transgender community here in Georgia as well,\u201d Graham said.\n\n\u201cWe are fighting laws that want to take us backward. The challenges are real, but we\u2019ve survived it all before. We are the most resilient community imaginable. We will make sure that people have access to medical care. We will make sure that our young people have the support they need,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd we will eventually win these laws in Georgia and find a day when they stop coming after us.\u201d",
