Kennedy Jr., has launched an online portal for \u201cwhistleblowers\u201d reporting medical providers if they offer gender affirming treatment to trans people\u2014an alarming escalation of President Donald Trump\u2019s unconstitutional war on trans people\u2019s health care.\n\nOn April 14, the HHS released accompanying legal guidance on how to subvert privacy laws and disclose sensitive information about doctors and their patients to a hostile government entity. It does not say that reports must be about violations of the law; it seems to encourage the reporting of any action taken by a provider that is at odds with Trump\u2019s anti-trans Executive Order 14187, titled \u201cProtecting Children From Chemical and Surgical Mutilation,\u201d regardless of actual state and federal law.\n\n\u201cPlease reference EO 14187 in your complaint,\u201d the portal notes. Meanwhile, the guidance says it ensures \u201crobust anti-retaliation protections for individuals who make a report in order to ensure compliance with the Executive Order.\u201d\n\nIt further says that a report should be filed by anyone with \u201ca good faith belief\u201d that a medical provider\u2019s actions \u201cviolates professional or clinical standards.\u201d While this is not a wholly unheard of protection for whistleblowers, Trump\u2019s EO rebuked the widely-accepted clinical standards set forth by the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH). In doing so, he may have opened up the floodgates for any federal agency to create new \u201cstandards\u201d to fit his own anti-trans agenda.\n\nCalling trans-affirming care \u201cchemical and surgical mutilation\u201d is an unscientific dog whistle used by the far-right (and Trump\u2019s EO) to characterize evidence-based, trans-affirming care. Notably, such care\u2014including puberty blockers and hormone replacement therapy\u2014does not categorically and universally lead to irreversible \u201csterilization\u201d as erroneously asserted by the EO. Meanwhile, the Trump Administration has gone to great lengths to ensure that the practice of invasive, permanent, and unnecessary surgeries on intersex children remains intact.\n\nTrump\u2019s EO was blocked by multiple federal judges, at least temporarily, but this has not stopped federal agencies from trying to enforce it anyway. The ACLU and other civil rights groups have called on the courts to take bolder action in enforcing its injunction.\n\nU.S. District Judge Lauren King said the executive order violates constitutional protections by \u201ctreating people differently based on sex or transgender status.\u201d\n\n\u201c[T]he Order is not limited to children, or to irreversible treatments, nor does it target any similar medical interventions performed on cisgender youth,\u201d King wrote in a February ruling. \u201cFor example, a cisgender teen could obtain puberty blockers from such a provider as a component of cancer treatment, but a transgender teen with the same cancer care plan could not.\u201d\n\nEven more, the new HHS guidance latches on to the Church Amendments. This 1976 provision shields medical staff from disciplinary or legal action if they refuse to provide or aid an abortion or other lawful reproductive health care practice, as long as it is done so on the basis of \u201chis religious beliefs or moral convictions respecting sterilization procedures.\u201d\n\nIt appears Trump\u2019s EO, in characterizing trans-affirming care as \u201csterilization,\u201d is further weaponizing the decades-old anti-abortion law to empower anti-trans initiatives.\n\n\u201cThe Church Amendments protect employees from discrimination if, based on religious beliefs or moral convictions, they refuse to participate in child-mutilation procedures\u2014including the use of puberty-blockers or cross-sex hormones\u2014and/or raise an objection to a supervisor about participating in such procedures,\u201d the new HHS guidance says.\n\nAt the start of Trump\u2019s second term, the Department of Justice dropped four felony charges that it had filed against Dr. Ethan Haim, a surgeon who had completed his residency at Texas Children\u2019s Hospital. Prosecutors said he violated HIPAA with \u201cintent to cause malicious harm\u201d when, in 2023, he evidently took confidential patient records pertaining to minors who were not under his care, under false pretenses, and then leaked the documents to the far-right press.\n\nThe hospital had publicly announced it would cease gender affirming therapies for trans patients in 2022. However, it was not illegal to provide this kind of care when Haim targeted the pediatric hospital. Haim self-identifies as a \u201cwhistleblower.\u201d\n\nThis week, Haim took center stage at a Congressional hearing dedicated to bolstering legal protections for doctors who violate the law in the name of Trump\u2019s anti-trans agenda. \"I wouldn't want this to be done to anyone, not even liberals, even if they're the craziest communists ever,\" Haim said during the hearing. \"There's no one in this country who should be falsely accused and the entire power of the federal government be brought down on them.\" (It is unclear what the false accusations in question are, as Haim fully admitted to leaking the documents.)\n\nProsecutors did not provide an explanation for dropping the charges, but Haim told the New York Times he believed that he had President Trump to thank for it. \u201cHe\u2019s my man,\u201d Haim said.\n\nTrump has waged war on whistleblowers in almost every other circumstance\u2014including by firing the head of the government watchdog agency established to protect them.",
