His orders attempting to end birthright citizenship, to erase transgender people administratively under federal law, to ban lifesaving health care for transgender youth under 19, and to ban diversity, equity and inclusion programs have all additionally been struck down by federal courts so far.\n\nGLAAD\u2019s President and CEO Sarah Kate Ellis (she/her) issued the following statement:\n\u201cTransgender service members have been serving openly and honorably for many years. Politicizing their service is out of step with the views of the American people, compromises military readiness, and will make America less safe. With this ruling, the courts now follow countless military leaders who spoke out against this dangerous move.\u201d\n\nThe preliminary injunction was issued in the legal challenge Talbott v. Trump brought forward by LGBTQ legal groups GLAD Law and the National Center for Lesbian Rights.\n\nIn the opinion, U.S. District Court Judge Ana Reyes stated that \u201cthousands of transgender servicemembers have sacrificed\u2014some risking their lives\u2014to ensure for others the very equal protection rights the Military Ban seeks to deny them.\u201d Judge Reyes held that banning transgender service members from the military violates the equal protection clause of the U.S. Constitution because it is discrimination based on transgender status and sex; and because \u201cit is soaked in animus.\u201dJudge Reyes continued: \u201cIts language is unabashedly demeaning, its policy stigmatizes transgender persons as inherently unfit, and its conclusions bear no relation to fact.\u201d\n\nResearch shows that Trump\u2019s previous ban on trans service had a negative impact on military readiness, unit cohesion, and national security. 56 generals, admirals, and other leaders from every service branch condemned Trump\u2019s previous attempt to bar open service, noting it would \u201cdegrade readiness even more than the failed \u2018don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u2019 policy.\u201d\n\nIn his first days and weeks in office, Trump signed five executive orders specifically targeting transgender people\u2019s identities, health care, education, and transgender people actively and capably serving in the military as well as three more orders targeting diversity, equity, and inclusion with threats to defund educational institutions and nonprofit organizations. 10% of all Trump executive orders signed so far have targeted LGBTQ Americans and all others from marginalized backgrounds, at every American\u2019s expense.\n\nFor additional background and military experts\u2019 responses to the specific order targeted at transgender service members, see GLAAD\u2019s previous statement and facts for reporters here.",
