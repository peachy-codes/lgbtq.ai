Across the country and on the global stage, biological men are continuing to invade women\u2019s sports, robbing female athletes of opportunities, titles, scholarships, and dreams.

Selina Soule, once a top high school sprinter in Connecticut, saw her dreams crushed as biological males dominated her events\u2014stealing not only titles but chances to advance in her sport.\n\nTaylor Silverman, a professional skateboarder, has lost to biological men in multiple competitions. Despite backlash for speaking out, she continues to bravely advocate for fairness\u2014becoming a symbol of resistance against this ideological takeover.\n\nAnd just last month, Stephanie Turner, a female fencer, refused to compete against a transgender male at a Maryland tournament.
