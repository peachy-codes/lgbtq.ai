  "content": "The U.K. Department of Education\u2019s Minister for Women and Equalities, Bridget Phillipson, said that trans women should use bathrooms that correspond with their sex assigned at birth, although she stopped short of explicitly saying that trans women should use men\u2019s restrooms.\n\nPhillipson, who is a member of the U.K.\u2019s ruling Labour Party, appeared on Tuesday\u2019s edition of BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today program. During the interview, BBC presenter Anna Foster asked her which public restroom trans women should use following the U.K. Supreme Court\u2019s April 16 ruling that the legal definitions of \u201cman\u201d and \u201cwoman\u201d in the 2010 Equality Act are based on a person\u2019s \u201cbiological sex\u201d as assigned at birth. It is a question that another Labour minister, MP Karin Smyth, seemed unable to answer last week.\n\nPhillipson appears to have more clarity. Sort of. \u201cThe ruling was clear that provisions and services should be accessed on the basis of biological sex,\u201d Phillipson said.\n\nShe added that the U.K.\u2019s Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) \u201cwill be setting out additional guidance and a statutory code of practice, because we need to make sure that everyone has the ability to access services that are safe and appropriate, and respect their privacy and dignity.\u201d\n\nAccording to the BBC, the Equality Act 2010 allows for single-sex spaces and services that aren\u2019t considered discriminatory, when a user can reasonably object to the space being open to members of the opposite sex. Last week\u2019s Supreme Court ruling means that even if a trans woman has a gender recognition certificate, she can be barred from a woman\u2019s single-sex space like a bathroom.\n\nFoster continued to press Phillipson during their interview, replying, \u201cAnd just for clarity\u2026 If you are a trans woman, you\u2019re out in public, you need to use the toilet today, it is the men\u2019s toilet that you use?\u201d\n\nPhillipson repeated her first response verbatim before continuing, \u201cI know that many businesses, large and small, will ensure that they have appropriate provisions in place. For example, many businesses have moved towards unisex provision or separate [bathroom] cubicles that can be used by anyone.\u201d\n\nFoster pointed out that in some cases, \u201cthat third space doesn\u2019t exist yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn many cases, those do already exist, including in small businesses,\u201d Phillipson replied. \u201cThey do. Go into your local caf\u00e9, a local family caf\u00e9, chances are, you\u2019ll have one cubicle that\u2019s self-contained, that can be used by anyone.\u201d\n\nPhillipson\u2019s public position on which bathrooms trans women should use has shifted since last June, when the Labour Party announced plans to streamline the process that allows trans people to get approval for gender recognition certificates (GRCs), the document that changes a person\u2019s recorded sex, and registered trans women as legally female and trans men as legally male. The plan would have made it less burdensome for trans people to meet the criteria required to obtain GRCs.\n\nWhen Phillipson was pressed on which bathrooms trans women with gender recognition certificates should use during a June Times Radio interview, she responded, \u201cI would expect that if you were someone that had gone through that formal process of recognition you are, to all intents and purposes, for legal purposes, regarded as being in a different gender regardless of the sex into which you were born\u2026 I would think that in those cases people would be using female toilets.\u201d\n\nPhillipson isn\u2019t the first government minister who could or would not explain which public bathrooms trans people are now expected to use following the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling. When Karin Smyth, Minister of State for the Department of Health and Social Care, was asked whether trans women can use women\u2019s services and facilities during a Times Radio interview, she told the outlet that it is a \u201clarge complex issue\u201d that \u201cvaries upon what the provision of those service providers are.\u201d\n\nLabour Party leader and current Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who said last year that he opposes \u201cgender ideology\u201d and that \u201cbiological women\u2019s spaces need to be protected,\u201d praised the ruling shortly after it was issued last week. On Tuesday, the BBC reported that a spokesperson for Starmer said that he does not believe transgender women are women. This is a change from Starmer\u2019s position just a few years ago; in 2022, when he was an MP and leader of the Opposition Party, he said that trans women are women.\n\n\u201cNo, the Supreme Court judgment has made clear that when looking at the Equality Act, a woman is a biological woman,\u201d the spokesperson stated.\n\nAccording to U.K. legal experts and LGBTQ+ advocacy groups, the ruling may have sweeping negative consequences not only for trans people, but for intersex people and cis women as well.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re yet to see how all of this will play out in practice, but it seems clear that this won\u2019t just hurt the trans community. The reasoning adopted, and the relentless desire to police \u2018what is a woman\u2019 can only hurt our wider communities,\u201d legal researcher Jess O\u2019Thomson wrote for the U.K.-based LGBTQ+ website QueerAF last Wednesday. \u201cNow is the time to work in solidarity with other marginalised groups, and resist an establishment which wants to force us into even smaller boxes.\u201d\n\n",
