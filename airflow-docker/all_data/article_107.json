  "content": "Among President Trump\u2019s first executive orders were those targeting transgender people\u2019s identity, military service, access to health care, access to education, and access to sports. \n\nGLAAD analyzed 35 first day stories from six of the largest media outlets. Only 13 of 35 stories included at least one quote by a transgender person. Day one stories have a greater reach than follow-on coverage. The survey found:\n\nOnly 6 of the 13 stories that included a transgender person stories had facts and context to counter White House rhetoric\n17 of the 22 stories that did not include a transgender person also did not include a quote from an LGBTQ person or group\n7 of the 35 stories included quotes from professionals with experience in the topics being discussed\n4 stories quoted an anonymous \u201cWhite House official\u201d who discussed restricting the rights of transgender people. \nOnly one of 35 stories quoted a White House staff member by name. \nOutlets that have out LGBTQ reporters, reporters with established relationships with LGBTQ advocacy groups, and outlets with units dedicated to coverage of diverse topics, were more likely to include transgender voices and accurate context.\n\u201cTransgender Americans are clearly under assault by the Trump administration, including unprecedented attempts to erase and dehumanize,\u201d GLAAD President and CEO Sarah Kate Ellis (she/her) said. \u201cIt is imperative that media covering the administration\u2019s efforts to exclude transgender people report on this pattern of inaccurate, animus-filled behavior, and include the voices of transgender people and facts about lives and experiences. Reporters must take extra time to include the community, check facts, include context, and challenge what is being said and proposed.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen only 28% of non-LGBTQ Americans say they personally know a trans person, news stories about our community are an extraordinary opportunity to humanize, or demonize us,\u201d said GLAAD\u2019s Shane Diamond (he/him), Director of Communications and Trans Advocacy. \u201cGLAAD\u2019s study shows that responsible, accurate, and inclusive coverage is possible, even with the demands of a busy news cycle.  All media must commit to basic standards that hold the administration accountable and accurately reflect the community under attack.\u201d\n\nGLAAD\u2019s survey noted whether the stories: \n\nInclude a quote from a transgender person or trans-led advocacy group\nInclude a queer rights advocate group (LGBQ but not T)\nInclude transgender person/ community member personally impacted\nAdditionally, GLAAD evaluated for context, about the trans community, about authoritarianism/project 2025, about White House staff leading anti-trans EOs, or for comment from a non-LGBTQ third party expert in the subject area.\n\nThe mixed results found that transgender voices were included in the following outlets and stories about the executive orders:\n\nABC News: 3 of 5 stories.\nAssociated Press: 2 of 5 stories; one story included multiple trans voices.\nCBS News: 2 of 5 stories.\nNBC News: 3 of 5 stories.\nReuters: 1 of 5 stories.\nUSA Today: 2 of 5 stories.\n17 of the 22 stories that did not include a transgender person also did not include a quote from an LGBTQ person or group.\n\nA day one story from Reuters about the order titled \u201cDefending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism\u201d did not include a transgender person\u2019s response, but did include a one from an LGBTQ advocacy leader. It did not challenge the administration to define or clarify \u201cgender ideology,\u201d a term created by opponents of transgender people as a way to dehumanize them and justify discrimination. Unfortunately, the story also repeats rhetoric from the executive order without clarification or challenge, including inaccurate or undefined claims such as \u201can individual\u2019s immutable biological classification.\u201d \n\n\n\nA USA Today story about Trump\u2019s executive order that \u201crecognizes two sexes\u201d does not include an LGBTQ voice, or an expert in science or medicine to challenge inaccurate claims. The article quotes an unnamed \u201cincoming White House official\u201d and \u201cTrump staffer\u201d who previewed and amplified the order\u2019s inaccurate, baseless rhetoric. The story did not challenge the accuracy, legality, need for, or practicality of implementing an order intent on targeting transgender people by ignoring scientific consensus that human biology is diverse and complex, and that gender diversity is recognized throughout history and cultures. The order, and the story, also neglect the reality of intersex people, who are born with diverse sex characteristics that can be both female and male, and whose experiences helped lead the change to passports allowing for gender neutral markers.\n\nBy contrast, a USA Today story in early February about an executive order targeting transgender women in sports includes a transgender person\u2019s response as well as important context and legal expertise on the challenges to the order. It includes questions about directives to the Education Department to implement and enforce the order while Trump has promised to eliminate the department. \n\n\n\nAn ABC News story about the administration\u2019s plans to target transgender people serving in the military does not include a transgender person, service member, or legal advocate, even though the proposal was thoroughly covered in the first Trump administration. The story also repeats, without challenge, baseless rhetoric in the order targeting the integrity of the entire transgender community. \n\nAnother ABC News story includes voices of transgender people and LGBTQ advocacy groups, as well as medical researchers and legal experts, to explain the falsehoods included in the \u201ctwo sexes\u201d order. Context about intersex people is included.\n\n\nOutlets that employ and assign out LGBTQ reporters or have units dedicated to coverage of diverse topics produce stories that are more consistently inclusive and accurate. These stories draw on reporter and team experience in covering LGBTQ people and topics, close connections and trust with sources, and familiarity with research and facts helpful to all readers and viewers.\n\n\n\nStories from the Associated Press were uniformly inclusive of the LGBTQ community, with most stories including at least one or more transgender and LGBTQ advocates\u2019 voices. A story about Trump\u2019s effort to criminalize best practice health care for minors under 19 included multiple trans voices and noted that the order\u2019s graphic language conflicted with medical expertise and research supporting the care. AP\u2019s coverage is important and influential as it is carried by thousands of outlets across the country, and often referred to in other outlets\u2019 coverage, such as this piece by CBS News. \n\n\n\nNBC\u2019s comprehensive coverage of the health care order included responses from transgender people and multiple citations of research showing the effectiveness of the care and its support by every major medical association. Earlier coverage of the first executive orders failed to include transgender voices, while quoting liberally from a \u201cWhite House official\u201d whose language\u2014\u201crestoring sanity\u201d\u2014was defamatory and unchallenged. A story about Trump\u2019s education order includes a mention about \u201cindoctrination\u201d in schools without pushing officials to define what that means or provide evidence of it happening. The story was mostly focused on the effort to defund public schools via choice vouchers, and did not include a transgender person or LGBTQ group. \n\n\n\nOutlets covering the Trump White House and its unprecedented targeting of transgender people can improve the accuracy of their stories and representation of the community by establishing protocols for coverage:\n\nSeek and include transgender voices in stories about transgender people.\nCenter facts over rhetoric.\nInclude context and consequences. \nQuote administration sources by name and title, particularly if they are speaking negatively about marginalized people and proposing to restrict rights of any marginalized group. \nResearch and include a history of anti-LGBTQ activism and animus by the Trump White House officials and affiliated groups.\nAdditional background:\n\nGLAAD: LGBTQ legal groups have filed at least nine lawsuits against the anti-trans executive orders, four of which have been blocked in federal courts.\nGALLUP: 9.3% of Americans identify as LGBTQ\nGLAAD has documented 240+ attacks in policy and rhetoric from the Trump administration via the Trump Accountability Tracker\nGLAAD Accountability Project: 200+ profiles of public figures who use their platforms to spread disinformation and harmful policies targeting LGBTQ people\nGLAAD: Terms to avoid: \u201cGender ideology,\u201d \u201ctransgenderism,\u201d \u201cbiological boy/girl.\u201d These are inaccurate terms not used by transgender people or the medical community. They are terms used to dehumanize trans people and undermine authentic identity. \u201cBiological boy\u201d is inaccurate and not a term used by the medical or scientific community because it does not reflect the proven diversity of human biology or the reality of intersex people.\nGLAAD has documented the Trump administration\u2019s harmful attempts to erase LGBTQ people on government websites, including health-related informational sites, and the censoring of the word \u201ctransgender\u201d from the National Park Service\u2019s site about the Stonewall National Monument that attempts to remove the contributions of transgender people from the Stonewall Riots and the LGBTQ movement.",
