  "content": "The Supreme Court agreed on Monday in a case from Colorado to decide whether state and local governments can enforce laws banning conversion therapy for LGBTQ+ children.\n\nThe conservative-led court is taking up the case amid actions by President Donald Trump targeting transgender people, including a ban on military service and an end to federal funding for gender-affirming care for transgender minors.\n\nThe justices also have heard arguments in a Tennessee case over whether state bans on treating transgender minors violate the Constitution. But they have yet to issue a decision.\n\nColorado is among roughly half the states that prohibit the practice of trying to change a person\u2019s sexual orientation or gender identity through counseling.\n\nThe issue is whether the law violates the speech rights of counselors. Defenders of such laws argue that they regulate the conduct of professionals who are licensed by the state. The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver upheld the state law. The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta has struck down local local bans in Florida.\n\nIn 2023, the court had turned away a similar challenge, despite a split among federal appeals courts that had weighed state bans and come to differing decisions.\n\nAt the time, three justices, Samuel Alito, Brett Kavanaugh and Clarence Thomas, said they would have taken on the issue. It takes four justices to grant review. The nine-member court does not typically reveal how justices vote at this stage of a case so it\u2019s unclear who might have provided the fourth vote.\n\n\nThe case will be argued in the court\u2019s new term, which begins in October. The appeal on behalf of Kaley Chiles, a counselor in Colorado Springs, was filed by Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative legal organization that has appeared frequently at the court in recent years in cases involving high-profile social issues.\n\nChiles has had to turn away clients because of the law, ADF lawyer Jim Campbell said Monday on a conference call for reporters, though he declined to say how many.\n\nChiles said the law, with potential fines of $5,000 and license suspension or even revocation, \u201cinterferes with my ability to serve my clients with integrity.\u201d\n\nOne of ADF\u2019s earlier cases was a 5-4 decision in 2018 in which the justices ruled that California could not force state-licensed anti-abortion crisis pregnancy centers to provide information about abortion.\n\nChiles\u2019 lawyers leaned heavily on that decision in asking the court to take up her case. They wrote that Chiles doesn\u2019t \u201cseek to \u2018cure\u2019 clients of same-sex attractions or to \u2018change\u2019 clients\u2019 sexual orientation.\u201d\n\nIn arguing for the court to reject the appeal, lawyers for Colorado wrote that lawmakers acted to regulate professional conduct, \u201cbased on overwhelming evidence that efforts to change a child\u2019s sexual orientation or gender identity are unsafe and ineffective.\u201d\n\n",
