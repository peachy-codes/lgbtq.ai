Military schools are under the direct control of the administration, which allows for implementation of these changes at a much quicker rate.\n\n\u201cLearning is a sacred and foundational right that is now being limited for students in DoDEA schools. The implementation of these [executive orders], without any due process or parental or professional input, is a violation of our children\u2019s right to access information that prevents them from learning about their own histories, bodies, and identities,\u201d said Natalie Tolley, a plaintiff on behalf of her three children in the department\u2019s schools.  \n\n\u201cI have three daughters, and they, like all children, deserve access to books that both mirror their own life experiences and that act as windows that expose them to greater diversity. The administration has now made that verboten in DoDEA schools,\u201d she added. The 12 students, ranging from pre-K to 11th grade, represent six families stationed in Virginia, Kentucky, Italy and Japan. \n\nThe suit was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the ACLU of Virginia and the ACLU of Kentucky in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia.
