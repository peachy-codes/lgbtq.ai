  "content": "A bill that would require transgender people in Montana to use the bathroom that aligns with their sex at birth has cleared one of its last legislative hurdles before going to the governor.\n\nThe Senate endorsed House Bill 121 on a 32-18 party-line vote on Monday, with all Republicans in support and all Democrats in opposition. During the debate on the Senate floor, supporters said it was a commonsense measure, but opponents warned of unintended consequences. House Bill 121 is sponsored by Rep. Kerri Seekins-Crowe, R-Billings. It would require public schools, correctional facilities, other public buildings and domestic violence shelters to designate bathrooms, changing rooms and sleeping areas for either men or women, based on their biological sex at birth, and to \u201ctake reasonable steps\u201d to keep the opposite sex out. Someone could then sue those facilities if they failed to take those steps and someone of the opposite sex used the space.\n\nThe bill wouldn\u2019t apply to rooms that only one person can use at a time.\n\nRepublicans argued HB 121 was needed to protect single-sex spaces, particularly for women. They said it would address concerns about violence and harassment in places where women feel especially vulnerable. \u201cIt reinforces protection for women and children and as outlined, specific spaces for their privacy and well-being,\u201d said Sen. John Fuller, R-Kalispell. \u201cAnd it's about clarity.\u201d\n\nDemocrats said transgender people aren\u2019t a threat to women, and that HB 121 would create the same type of discomfort it\u2019s trying to alleviate by requiring transgender men to use women\u2019s bathrooms.\n\n\u201cThis is not what the people of Montana need,\u201d said Sen. Cora Neumann, D-Bozeman. \u201cThey need you using their money wisely. They need you using our time wisely and voting on things that will actually make their lives better.\u201d\n\nThey also argued facilities would have a hard time meeting the requirements of the bill. Sen. Laura Smith, D-Helena, proposed amending the bill to take effect in July instead of immediately when it\u2019s signed into law. She said lawmakers have heard from shelters that say they may have to close if they don\u2019t have more time to get into compliance.\n\n\u201cI don't know why we wouldn't say, \u2018Let's hold on, guys, let's give ourselves a second, let\u2019s not harm vulnerable individuals who are in shelters or who are homeless in the middle of Montana winter,\u2019\u201d Smith said. Smith\u2019s motion to amend the bill failed on a 22-28 vote. Supporters of the bill said they believed concerns about shelter closures were \u201cred herrings.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf it's important, the governor can make an amendatory veto at a future date, and I would suggest lobbying him,\u201d said Fuller.\n\nHB 121 passed the House last month. It is scheduled for a final vote in the Senate on Tuesday. Once it passes, it will be on its way to Gov. Greg Gianforte\u2019s desk. The Gianforte administration has already indicated support for the bill, with Lt. Gov. Kristen Juras testifying in favor of it.\n\n",
