Susan Crawford was elevated to the state Supreme Court and Jill Underly will return as State Superintendent of Public Instruction.\n\nBoth candidates defeated opponents and campaign ads that targeted LGBTQ people, including a late surge of ads and text messages that baselessly spread fear about transgender people.\n\nThe Grio also reports that voters in La Crosse, Wisconsin, made history on Tuesday when they elected the city\u2019s first Black and first out gay mayor, Shaundel Washington-Spivey.\n\nA high number of voters turned out, with reports that polling places needed to print more ballots to accommodate. The race was billed as a \u201clitmus test,\u201d ABC News reported, for voters to \u201cget the chance to weigh in on President Donald Trump\u2019s agenda,\u201d and express their opinion on the actions of Trump\u2019s billionaire donor and \u201cDOGE\u201d leader Elon Musk.\n\nMusk and related political action committees contributed more than $20million to Brad Schimel\u2019s campaign, making this the most expensive judicial race in history. Musk personally campaigned in Wisconsin to offer two voters one million dollars each.\n\nGLAAD and Fair Wisconsin had documented the LGBTQ and equality records of the supreme court candidates.\n\nCrawford\u2019s election secures a pro-equality majority on the court, which could decide on abortion access, voting rights, and accurately representative voting districts for the state legislature.\n\nSchimel made several appearances at Alliance Defending Freedom events, LGBTQ Nation reported.
