Gavin Newsom said transgender athletes playing in women\u2019s sports is \u201can issue of fairness\u201d in a break from most Democrats\u2019 position on the topic.\n\n\u201cWell, I think it\u2019s an issue of fairness. I completely agree with you on that. It is an issue of fairness. It\u2019s deeply unfair,\u201d Newsom said in a podcast episode with conservative activist Charlie Kirk.\n\n\u201cI revere sports, and so the issue of fairness is completely legit. And I saw that the last couple of years. Boy did I saw how [Republicans] were able to weaponize that issue at another level,\u201d he said. Newsom addressed both sides of the issue, saying, \u201cYou know that these poor people are more likely to commit suicide, have anxiety and depression, and the way that people talk down to vulnerable communities is an issue that I have a hard time with as well. So both things I can hold in my hand.\u201d\n\nNewsom\u2019s comments come after President Donald Trump signed an executive order last month banning transgender women from competing in women\u2019s sports, delivering on a political issue central to his 2024 campaign.\n\nOther Democrats have gotten pushback for comments similar to Newsom\u2019s. Democratic Rep. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts has been vocal about transgender policies and told The New York Times in November that identity politics, particularly around transgender rights, hurt Democrats in the election, saying, \u201cI have two little girls. I don\u2019t want them getting run over on a playing field by a male or formerly male athlete. But as a Democrat, I\u2019m supposed to be afraid to say that.\u201d\n\nMoulton got criticism from Democrats for his comments, and his campaign manager, Matt Chilliak, resigned in response to the remarks, according to The Boston Globe. Newsom has a long record of supporting LGBTQ rights. He ordered the city and county of San Francisco to start issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples in 2004 after being elected mayor of San Francisco.\n\nThe California governor\u2019s comments come as he eyes a potential 2028 presidential bid, having watched Republicans wield the issue against Democrats last cycle. Transgender policies were a major factor in the advertising wars of the 2024 presidential race, as Trump and his allies leaned into sharp attacks on former Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 record, running waves of stark TV spots.\n\n\u201cKamala\u2019s agenda is they/them, not you,\u201d said one ad, referring to the pronouns used by some transgender and non-binary individuals.\n\nNewsom called the ad \u201cdevastating\u201d to her campaign during the podcast. He went further, saying, \u201cShe didn\u2019t even react to it, which was even more devastating.\u201d\n\nIn total, Republican advertisers spent more than $60 million on ads that referenced transgender policies and LGBTQ rights during the 2024 presidential campaign, some of which included specific references to athletics participation, according to data from the ad tracking firm AdImpact.\n\nThe debate spilled into some key Congressional races as well, as Republican candidates echoed the messaging from pro-Trump advertisers.\n\nAn ad from Texas GOP Sen. Ted Cruz, who was challenged unsuccessfully by Democratic Rep. Colin Allred last year, featured several girls playing school sports as a large, dark shadow looms over them. A narrator says, \u201cColin Allred could have stopped men from competing in women\u2019s sports, but instead he voted against our daughters. What kind of man does that?\u201d\n\nIn response to the criticism, Allred became the first Democrat that year to take to the airwaves directly rebutting the attacks, saying in an ad of his own that \u201cI don\u2019t want boys playing girls sports or any of this ridiculous stuff that Ted Cruz is saying.\u201d\n\n",
