It is not immediately clear whether that order will focus on K-12 sports, collegiate sports, or a broad ban on men competing as trans-identifying females in women\u2019s sports.\n\n\nTrump has long promised to ban men who identify as women from participating in female sports, citing high-profile stories such as that of Riley Gaines, an athlete forced to compete against a man who identified as a female swimmer named Lia Thomas. Gaines, who did not respond to a request for comment, will address the Republican Study Committee on gender issues Wednesday, The Daily Wire reported.\n\nDuring the 2024 election cycle, Trump and his team embraced this issue, voicing the concerns of American parents across the country \u2014 that their daughters\u2019 private spaces were being invaded by men, that their opportunities were being taken away, and that all of this was being done in the name of gender ideology.\n\nLeading up to Election Day, Trump advisors told The Daily Wire that the messaging was reaching women, specifically suburban women, the very same population that Democrats were targeting with aggressive abortion messaging. The Wall Street Journal predicted that trans-identifying males in women\u2019s sports would be the 2024 sleeper issue.\n\n\nLia Thomas and Riley Gaines (Photo by Rich von Biberstein/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images)\n\nThroughout his campaign, Trump repeatedly stated that Kamala Harris and Democrats were pushing a dangerous ideology that Americans didn\u2019t want.
