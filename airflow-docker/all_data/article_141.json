  "content": "Five days after President Donald Trump declared \u201cgender ideology\u201d to be \u201cone of the most prevalent forms of child abuse,\u201d Montana\u2019s Republican-controlled House of Representatives killed a bill that would have enshrined much the same idea into state law by criminalizing parents and medical providers.\n\nMontana Senate Bill 164 would have made it a felony for any adult to help transgender children under 16 to gain access to gender-affirming medical care\u2014including hormones, puberty blockers, and surgeries\u2014classifying such help as child endangerment. On Tuesday, House lawmakers voted 58-40 to reject the proposed law, with 17 Republicans joining Democrats to block the bill from advancing to its final reading.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s overly broad,\u201d the lone Republican to speak against the bill, Rep. Brad Barker, said Tuesday. Barker said that while he generally opposes gender-affirming care for trans youth, SB164 was \u201cthe wrong approach.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like the thought of criminalizing parents,\u201d Barker said, entreating fellow Republicans to \u201cvote with your conscience.\u201d\n\nThe bill carried penalties of up to five years in prison and $10,000 in fines for any adults, including parents and doctors, who provided children with surgery, puberty blockers, or hormone replacement therapy for the purpose of \u201caltering the appearance\u201d of the child or affirming the child\u2019s gender. If \u201cserious bodily injury\u201d occurred, the maximum punishment was 10 years imprisonment and $25,000 in fines.\n\n\u201cTurning parents and doctors into felons is absolutely not the approach that best serves this state,\u201d Democratic Rep. SJ Howell, the first non-binary person to be elected to the Montana legislature, said on the House floor.\n\nThe bill cleared the Senate in February, 30-20, with two Republicans voting against it. In that floor debate, the legislation\u2019s sponsor, Republican Sen. John Fuller, called it a \u201csimple bill\u201d to protect Montana\u2019s children. \u201cThe state does have a compelling interest, a very compelling interest, to avoid the sterilization and sexual mutilation of children,\u201d he said. In 2023, Fuller sponsored a law that threatened medical providers\u2019 licensing if they offered gender-affirming care to minors, a law that courts have blocked while litigation proceeds.\n\nTuesday\u2019s vote was the second time this year a large swath of Republicans crossed party lines to block an anti-trans bill.\n\n\u201cThis bill is not about politics, it\u2019s about safeguarding the health and innocence of Montana youth,\u201d one of SB164\u2019s House supporters, Republican Rep. Braxton Mitchell, said Tuesday. But more than a quarter of members of his own party disagreed, suggesting a potential turning point for the Montana legislature, at least on trans issues.\n\nTuesday\u2019s vote was the second time this year a large swath of Republicans crossed party lines to block an anti-trans bill. Last year, Montana\u2019s first openly transgender lawmaker, Rep. Zooey Zephyr, said her Republican colleagues often privately bemoan the transphobic culture wars and apologize to her for their votes on anti-LGBTQ legislation.\n\nEven so, Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte signed two anti-trans bills into law last month\u2014a bathroom ban and a law prohibiting trans girls and women from playing on women\u2019s sports teams from kindergarten through college. The bathroom ban has been temporarily blocked. A state law that prohibited trans women from participating in female collegiate sports was ruled unconstitutional in 2022.\n\nOrlando Pride supporters stand in front of a banner about protecting Trans kids during a game between Orlando Pride and Chicago Stars at Inter&Co Stadium on March 14, 2025 in Orlando, Florida. \nThe right to privacy is enshrined in the Montana constitution, and state courts have strongly affirmed its application to healthcare laws. Last December, the Montana Supreme Court upheld a lower court\u2019s preliminary injunction on a law that would have made gender-affirming medical care providers vulnerable to licensing board disciplinary proceedings. And last summer, it ruled that a parental consent law for minors seeking abortion was unconstitutional. (In January, Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen asked the U.S. Supreme Court to declare that ruling an unconstitutional infringement on parental rights. The Supreme Court has not decided whether to hear the case.)\n\nIf it had passed, SB164 would have become the first law in the country defining gender-affirming care as a form of felony child endangerment. (Child endangerment and abuse fall under different statutes, but both evoke the same myth that gender-affirming care is dangerous for youth.)\n\nMontana, however, wouldn\u2019t have been the first state to direct child welfare workers to investigate families of trans children. In 2022, Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott ordered the state\u2019s Department of Family and Protective Services to open child abuse investigations into parents who seek gender-affirming care for their children. That directive remains partially blocked after families of trans children and the LGBTQ advocacy group PFLAG sued.",
