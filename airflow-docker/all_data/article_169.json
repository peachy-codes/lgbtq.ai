Gavin Newsom has spoken out against allowing transgender women and girls to compete in female sports\n\nCalifornia\u2019s Gavin Newsom opposes trans athletes in women\u2019s sports, splitting with progressivesBy BILL BARROWAssociated PressThe Associated Press\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom, a potential 2028 Democratic presidential candidate, used the inaugural episode of his new podcast to break from progressives by speaking out against allowing transgender women and girls to compete in female sports.\n\nNewsom made his declaration in an extended conversation with conservative activist Charlie Kirk, the 31-year-old who built the influential Turning Point USA organization that helped President Donald Trump increase his support last fall among the youngest generation of voters. Kirk, like Trump, has been a vocal opponent of allowing transgender women and girls to participate.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s an issue of fairness, I completely agree with you on that. It is an issue of fairness \u2014 it\u2019s deeply unfair,\u201d Newsom told Kirk on \u201cThis is Gavin Newsom.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not wrestling with the fairness issue,\u201d continued Newsom, who played varsity baseball as a college student. \u201cI totally agree with you. \u2026 I revere sports. So, the issue of fairness is completely legit.\u201d\n\nThe governor\u2019s comments are the latest in Democrats\u2019 efforts to reconcile a 2024 election that returned Trump to the White House and gave Republicans control of both chambers of Congress. Among the disagreements since November is how much cultural issues \u2013 as opposed to economic policy and other matters \u2013 explain the party\u2019s losses.\n\nOverall, polling suggests that allowing transgender female athletes to play on women\u2019s teams isn\u2019t broadly popular. Even most Democrats \u2014 around 7 in 10 \u2014 oppose allowing transgender female athletes to participate in women\u2019s sports, according to a January New York Times/Ipsos poll. A 2023 Gallup poll also found that Democrats were divided on whether transgender people should be able to play on sports teams that match their current gender identity.\n\nNewsom, who has long positioned himself as a social progressive, drew sharp rebukes from LGBTQ advocates.\n\n\u201cSometimes Gavin Newsom goes for the Profile in Courage, sometimes not,\u201d said California Assemblyman Chris Ward and state Sen. Carolina Menjivar, who lead the state\u2019s LGBTQ legislative caucus. \u201cWe woke up profoundly sickened and frustrated by these remarks.\u201d\n\nTony Hoang, executive director of Equality California, said he was \u201cdisappointed and angered\u201d by Newsom\u2019s statements and that they \u201cadded to the heartbreak and fear\u201d the transgender community feels under the Trump administration.\n\n\u201cRight now, transgender youth, their families, their doctors, and their teachers are facing unprecedented attacks from extremist politicians who want to eviscerate their civil rights and erase them from public life,\u201d Hoang said. \u201cThey need leaders who will unequivocally fight for them.\u201d\n\nCalifornia law, enacted before Newsom became governor, requires schools in the state to allow transgender athletes to play on school sports teams consistent with their gender identity.\n\nBeyond questions about athletics, there is less public support for broader restrictions on transgender rights and issues like medical care for transgender people, particularly among Democrats.\n\nAccording to AP VoteCast, 55% of voters in the 2024 election said support for transgender rights in government and society has gone too far, while about 2 in 10 said it\u2019s been about right and a similar share said it hasn\u2019t gone far enough. Voters were also slightly more likely to oppose than favor laws that ban gender-affirming medical treatment, such as puberty blockers and hormone therapy, for minors who identify as transgender.\n\nBut Republicans have nonetheless sought to capitalize on the cultural touchstone that sports represent in America.\n\nTrump regularly hammered Democratic nominee Vice President Kamala Harris, Newsom\u2019s fellow Californian, for supporting LGBTQ+ rights. Trump promised at his rallies to get \u201ctransgender insanity the hell out of our schools\u201d and \u201ckeep men out of women\u2019s sports.\u201d His campaign also spent tens of millions of dollars on television and digital ads with the searing summation: \u201cKamala is for they/them. President Trump is for you.\u201d\n\n\u201cBoy, did I see how you guys were able to weaponize it,\u201d Newsom told Kirk, before yielding to Kirk\u2019s protest and saying instead that the ads were an effective \u201chighlight\u201d during the campaign.\n\nSince taking office, Trump has threatened to withhold federal money from schools that allow transgender athletes to compete in women\u2019s\u2019 or girls\u2019 events. He declared victory on the issue recently when the NCAA, which governs collegiate athletics in the U.S., changed its policy to restrict women\u2019s sporting events to those athletes who were assigned the female gender at birth. Previously, the NCAA had a sport-by-sport policy determined by the respective sports\u2019 national or international governing bodies.\n\nWard and Menjivar, the California lawmakers, said playing on a team consistent with one\u2019s gender hasn\u2019t been a problem \u201cuntil Donald Trump began obsessing about it.\u201d\n\nKirk, not Newsom, brought up the overall issue during their hour-plus conversation, which focused in part on how Democrats can rebuild a broader coalition of voters. Kirk pressed Newsom on whether he would speak out in opposition to transgender women athletes in competition.\n\nThe governor attempted to mitigate his comments, saying the discussion is about more than competitive advantage.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s also a humility and a grace that these poor people are more likely to commit suicide, have anxiety and depression, and the way that people talk down to vulnerable communities is an issue that I have a hard time with, as well,\u201d Newsom said. \u201cSo, both things I can hold in my hand. How can we address this issue with the kind of decency that I think is inherent in you but not always expressed on the issue and at the same time deal with the unfairness.\u201d\n\nStill, Newsom\u2019s approach marks a different political tack than he took on same-sex marriage more than two decades ago. As San Francisco mayor in 2004, Newsom drew national attention for the first time by directing the city clerk to begin issuing same-sex marriage licenses.\n\nThe move prompted legal action that led to a 2008 ruling from the California Supreme Court legalizing same-sex marriage in the nation\u2019s largest state. That decision came seven years before the U.S. Supreme Court established same-sex marriage as a national right. \u2014\n\nBarrow reported from Atlanta.
