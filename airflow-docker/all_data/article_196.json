Policy 5756 was initially adopted in 2016 and revised three years later. The policy is believed by the district to be mandated by the state, but a clarification issued in April by New Jersey's Education Department says the state \"does not mandate curriculum.\"\n\n\"I'm tired of people hiding behind [state learning standards] as an excuse to teach this far-left agenda, this woke agenda, this agenda that includes gender theory and all this other stuff that confuses our kids,\" parent Robert Pluta, who pulled his children out of the district, told FOX News Digital.\n\nLesson plans, books and assignments on gender identity are part of the district's curriculum.\n\nParents and parental rights groups are outraged at a school district in New Jersey over its curriculum on gender identity. (iStock)\n\n\"This super woke progressive agenda \u2026 it's so saturated with race and sex. And it's just like, can we just get back to teaching? I don't want a conservative school, I don't want a liberal school,\" Pluta said.\n\nThe picture book \"Jacob\u2019s New Dress\" by Ian Hoffman and Sarah Hoffman, which is read to kindergartners, tells the story of a young boy who likes playing dress-up and wants to wear a dress to school, even as his classmates tell him that he cannot wear \"girl\" clothes. Kindergartners also are read \"My Princess Boy\" by Cheryl Kilodavis, which follows a boy who likes \"pretty things\" and prefers to wear tiaras and \"girly dresses.\"\n\nSecond-graders are read \"10,000 Dresses\" by Marcus Ewert, which features a biological boy named Bailey who dreams of wearing extravagant dresses, and \"Red\" by Michael Hall, a story that details how a blue crayon with a red label is facing an identity crisis because the color he identifies as on the inside is not what is seen on his label.\n\nAnd fifth graders are told the story of \"PRIDE: The Story of Harvey Milk and the Rainbow Flag\" by Rob Sanders. Harvey Milk was the first openly gay man to be elected to public office in California.\n\nAnother parent, who also lives in the district and pulled her children from the public school system over a gender identity curriculum, cited a lesson on the \"gender snowperson\" taught to fourth-grade students, who are asked to think of themselves as a \"snowperson\" and play a game where they can choose their gender.\n\n\"My main concern is that they're pushing social transition. The curricula and the policy really promote, they really encourage children to consider social transition,\" the parent, who wished to remain anonymous, told FOX News Digital.\n\nThe parent also explained that there are four steps in gender transition: social transition, puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones and sex reassignment surgery. She said the district defends itself by noting that it does not administer puberty blockers nor use other medical methods of gender transitioning.\n\n\"Once you've led the horse to water, the horse is going to drink,\" she said. \"That is what a lot of parents are so concerned about, that they're actually encouraging it.\"\n\nAt Lawrence Township, there is a \"social justice\" unit under the social studies curriculum on \"Identity/True Self,\" which is taught to students as early as kindergarten. \n\nFifth graders in this unit are taught that \"one of the first steps that all people \u2014 adults or children \u2014 take, if they feel their internal sense of gender and their sex assigned at birth do not match, is to socially transition.\"\n\n\"This means adults and children live their lives in a way that expresses their internal sense of who they are \u2014 their gender identity,\" the unit description states. \"A person may use a new name and/or different pronouns than before. Some might change their gender expression \u2014 wear different clothes or have a new hairstyle. Students usually want to \u2014 and have the right to \u2014 use facilities or join school activities that align with their gender identity.\"\n\nErika Sanzi, the director of outreach for nonprofit parent group Parents Defending Education, told FOX News Digital the curriculum is \"completely inappropriate for elementary schoolers.\"\n\n\"It is based in gender ideology and is no different than a teacher choosing to read from the catechism and telling students everything in it is true,\" she said. \"Perhaps instead of indoctrinating 5-year-olds and 8-year-olds, they could focus on activism-free reading instruction.\"\n\nOther social studies units taught to young school children include \"Skin Color,\" \"Bias/Prejudice\" and \"Being an Ally/Protest.\"\n\nAccording to the district's transgender policy, the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination \"generally makes it unlawful for schools to subject individuals to differential treatment based on gender identity or expression.\"\n\nThe policy also states that the district \"shall accept a student\u2019s asserted gender identity\" and that \"parental consent is not required.\"\n\n\"A student need not meet any threshold diagnosis or treatment requirements to have his or her gender identity recognized and respected by the school district, school or school staff members,\" the policy states. \"In addition, a legal or court-ordered name change is not required. There is no affirmative duty for any school district staff member to notify a student\u2019s parent of the student\u2019s gender identity or expression.\"\nTransgender flag\n\nThe Lawrence Township Public Schools' transgender policy was adopted for the current school year along with the 600 other districts in New Jersey.
