Gavin Newsom\u2019s podcast.\n\nAssembly Bills 89 and 844 were the subject of a Tuesday hearing in the California Assembly Arts, Entertainment, Sports, and Tourism Committee. AB 89, introduced by Republican Assembly member Kate Sanchez, would have compelled the California Interscholastic Federation (which governs high school sports in the state) to \u201cprohibit a pupil whose sex was assigned male at birth from participating on a girls\u2019 interscholastic sports team.\u201d AB 844, introduced by Republican Assembly member Bill Essayli, would have likewise amended the state Education Code to remove language allowing students to access school facilities \u201cconsistent with his or her gender identity.\u201d\n\nInstead, access would have been restricted \u201cbased upon the pupil\u2019s sex,\u201d a change which would have affected colleges as well as public K-12 schools.
