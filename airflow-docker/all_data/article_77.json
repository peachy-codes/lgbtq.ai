The story has been updated to correct this.\n\nWashington State made history on Wednesday when it became the first state in the country to pass legislation increasing access to hormone therapy.\n\nHB 1971 declares that health care plans who cover hormone treatments \u201cmust provide reimbursement for a 12-month refill of covered prescription hormone therapy obtained at one time by the enrollee,\u201d unless a doctor prescribes otherwise or the hormone in question is a controlled substance. Testosterone, due to being a controlled substance, was extended from 3-month refills to 6-month refills.\n\nThe bill received bipartisan support in the State Senate, passing 40-9, including six Republicans. All nine votes against the bill were from the GOP.\n\nSenator Keith Wagoner was one such Republican who voted in favor of HB 1971. He said he he was supporting the policy in spite of \u201cfringes\u201d online which had \u201cinflamed\u201d public debate by focusing squarely on the HRT\u2019s association with trans-affirming care.\n\n\u201cThat is such a small part of what this bill does,\u201d Wagoner told the Senate. He said he was speaking out in part because his own daughter relies on hormone therapy. As a survivor of brain cancer, which impacted her pituitary gland, she will likely be taking hormones for the rest of her life. The current timeframe for receiving hormones, which may limit people to a six-month, three-month or one-month supply, is a constant stressor for his family, he said.\n\n\u201cThe bill will alleviate a lot of suffering,\u201d Wagoner concluded.\n\nIn a press release, Planned Parenthood Alliance Advocates lauded Washington as the first state in the country to pass legislation improving access to hormone therapies. While President Donald Trump has called HRT \u201cchemical [...] mutilation\u201d as part of his broader war on \u201cgender ideology,\u201d it is mostly used for menopause, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), hyperandrogenism, and cancer survivors.\n\nCourtney Normand, the Washington State Director of PPAA, said in a statement that HB 1971 would help marginalized groups who otherwise struggle to access health care. \u201cThis bill is especially critical for our rural neighbors, those without transportation, people working multiple jobs, communities with low incomes or without wealth, and those who have long faced systemic discrimination,\u201d she said.\n\nThe bill is also a welcome protection for the growing number of trans people being targeted by the government.\n\n\u201cEvery day we fear losing access to gender affirming hormone therapy, and many are already rationing medication to build a reserve, myself included,\u201d said Jenna Comstock, who sits on the board of directors for Washington\u2019s LGBTQ Bar Association, during a prior hearing on the bill. \u201cRequiring health plans to provide hormone coverage to reimburse 12-month refills would help trans Washingtonians secure access to their medications, mitigating some harms of this uncertain political climate.\"",
