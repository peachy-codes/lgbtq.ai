  "content": "Early this week, New York Times opinion columnist Masha Gessen penned a piece purportedly exposing \u201cThe Hidden Motive Behind Trump\u2019s Attacks on Trans People.\u201d Unsurprisingly, the Trump policies Gessen sees as proof of an insidious Trumpian plot are reality-based measures that protect women and children and preserve American culture.\n\nGessen begins her supposed expos\u00e9 by bemoaning the \u201ccurrent, protracted bad-news moment\u201d and its repercussions for her \u201cpersonally\u201d as someone who is \u201ctrans and an immigrant.\u201d She then moves quickly to comparing the United States to Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. As the essay continues, Gessen\u2019s contention becomes clear: Trump\u2019s \u201cbarrage of attacks on trans people\u201d is central to his \u201cdenationalization campaign,\u201d which he pursues ostensibly so he can then deport them or implement a more fiendishly Hitlerian purpose.\n\nGessen likens trans people in America to Jews in Europe during the Holocaust and tells the story of a \u201cnonbinary\u201d friend who felt the need to hide her Star of David necklace when an alleged \u201cattacker\u201d questioned whether she was \u201ca girl or a boy,\u201d implying a link between antisemitism and traditional, biology-based views of sex. In other words, the United States has become like 1930s Germany, and those who refuse to accept the left\u2019s gender ideology are the 21st century\u2019s Nazis.\n\nAs evidence, Gessen cites Trump\u2019s \u201cassert[ion] that only two sexes exist;\u201d \u201cexecutive orders aimed at banning any mention of transgender people in schools, banning trans athletes from women\u2019s sports, ordering a stop to gender-affirming medical care for people under 19 and barring trans people from serving in the military;\u201d the elimination of the \u201cX\u201d designation on U.S. passports; and \u201cvisa guidelines\u201d that require the sex designation on a person\u2019s passport to match that on his birth certificate, among others.\n\nIn other words, from Gessen\u2019s perspective \u2014 and apparently that of The New York Times \u2014 the most compelling evidence that the Trump administration is an authoritarian regime akin to the Third Reich or the Soviet Union is its acknowledgment of biological and cultural realities and moral laws. Gessen characterizes Trump\u2019s acceptance of the fact that \u201conly two sexes exist: male and female, established at conception and immutable\u201d as an assertion that \u201ctrans people \u2026 do not exist.\u201d Trump referencing Payton McNabb and her being injured by a trans-identifying male during his joint address to Congress is an attack on trans people. (Gessen downplays the injury by asserting that \u201cserious volleyball injuries are surprisingly common,\u201d though evidence suggests that volleyball is one of the safer sports.)\n\nWhile Gessen may believe her own fearmongering, her conspiracy theory is ridiculous and unfounded. (Perhaps Gessen\u2019s conspiratorial thinking should be unsurprising, given that she actually suggested that Kamala Harris\u2019 refusal to double down on pro-trans policies cost her the election.) U.S. citizens who identify as transgender, nonbinary, and so forth (and so forth, as the identities multiply) are in no danger of being deported or alienated from society. Trump isn\u2019t denying the existence of people who claim to be transgender; he\u2019s just stating the fact that such people do not transcend the biological and cultural realities of male and female.\n\nThe whole trans-activist accusation of existence-denial is nonsensical in any case: It\u2019s fairly obvious that if a man claims to be a \u201csmart scientist\u201d and another man disagrees with him, he\u2019s denying the man\u2019s claim, not his existence (otherwise, whose claim is he disagreeing with?). A female who switches from identifying as male to identifying as nonbinary didn\u2019t commit suicide.\n\nDespite Gessen\u2019s protests and all the headlines implying that Trump is kicking trans people out of sports, no Trump policy does any such thing. Those who claim to be transgender are allowed to play sports with other people of the same sex \u2014 just like everyone else. A boy can try to look, act, and sound like a girl and still play sports \u2014 on the boys\u2019 sports teams.\n\nWhen it comes to passports, Gessen seems to ignore the fact that passports (and other forms of ID) have photographs for identification purposes, not just an M for male or an F for female. Passport photos are supposed to be recent when submitted, but they can be updated to reflect a drastic change in appearance, rendering the objection to the removal of the X designation a red herring. If all else fails, the individual can simply explain why his passport says he is male but he is attempting to look like a woman (an uncomfortable conversation for some, perhaps, but one that was chosen by the individual identifying as transgender). Trump isn\u2019t prohibiting the travel of people like Gessen.\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s common sense policies are simply a reflection of the truth that government has a role in preserving culture (or, in the case of the Biden administration, destroying it). That role exists even if it is as limited as ensuring that the passports it issues tell the truth about the carrier\u2019s sex instead of legitimizing his confusion. Viewed through this lens, the policies Gessen decries have nothing to do with targeting those who claim to be transgender \u2014 and certainly nothing to do with \u201cdenationalizing\u201d them \u2014 and everything to do with acknowledging the truths about reality that form the bedrock of this nation and its cultural norms.\n\nTrans activists, on the other hand, are perfectly willing to destroy America\u2019s cultural fabric in order to replace it with their own distorted framework \u2014 a framework in which the concepts of male and female exist, not as biological and cultural realities established by a Creator, but as malleable categories whose primary purpose is transgender cosplay. Gessen herself argued that the institution of marriage should be done away with in 2012, in part because marriage wasn\u2019t \u201ccompatible\u201d with her relationship arrangement. (Her \u201cnew partner\u201d at the time had just given birth to her brother\u2019s child, among other \u201cincompatibilities.\u201d)\n\nA more recent example of trans anarchism was brought to light by an Illinois mother who claimed that her 13-year-old daughter\u2019s school made female students undress in front of a male student. Trans activists booed the mother for speaking out at a school board meeting, and the school disputes the mother\u2019s claim. But even if the mother\u2019s story were completely false, that wouldn\u2019t change the fact that schools requiring girls to undress in front of boys (or men) is exactly what trans anarchists want \u2014 the total obliteration of boundaries and norms rooted in immutable distinctions between male and female.\n\nTrump opposes this imposition of cultural anarchy. His resistance is not based on a desire to render those who claim to be transgender nationless, but, apparently, on a recognition that this cultural anarchy if left unchecked will ultimately lead to the demise of the nation all Americans call their home. Thus Trump\u2019s emphasis in his joint address to Congress on the realities that a person is either male or female and \u201cevery child\u201d is \u201cperfect exactly the way God made\u201d him or her. Gessen and those who share her belief system are in no danger of losing their country, but all Americans are in danger of having it undermined by a radical trans agenda that brooks no dissent.\n\nInterestingly, in a 2023 interview with the New Yorker, Gessen discussed her parents\u2019 response to her using a boy\u2019s name and telling them she planned \u201cto have an operation when I grow up.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy parents, fortunately, were incredibly game. They were totally fine with it,\u201d Gessen said.\n\nTrump isn\u2019t \u201cdenationalizing\u201d trans people. He\u2019s simply telling radical trans activists what Gessen\u2019s parents should have told her a long time ago: No.",
