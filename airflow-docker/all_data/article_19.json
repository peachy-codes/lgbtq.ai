  "content": "2025\n04.15.2025  Sent a memo to lawmakers requesting that Congress rescind $1.1 billion in federal funding from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which contributes money to NPR and PBS. The funding is already appropriated by Congress. Public broadcasters like NPR and PBS have a track record of airing programming that highlights LGBTQ stories, issues, and communities,  providing representation and education often not found on commercial networks. The White House memo advocating for the cuts specifically criticized PBS for airing programs featuring transgender characters.\n\n04.04.2025  Issued a proclamation recognizing National Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month that erroneously claims that assaults by undocumented immigrants are one of the leading causes of sexual violence. In fact, eight out of 10 rapes are committed by someone known to the victim, according to data from the Department of Justice. Previous proclamations emphasized support for survivors and perpetrator accountability. Trump was found liable for sexual abuse in 2023. \n\n04.04.2025  Created a new Title IX Special Investigations Team focused on preventing transgender women and girls from women\u2019s and girls\u2019 sports teams and restrooms. The Departments of Education and Justice jointly said that this team will \u201cprotect students, and especially female athletes, from the pernicious effects of gender ideology in school programs and activities.\u201d Title IX was enacted by Congress in 1972 to protect students from discrimination \u201con the basis of sex.\u201d NCAA President Charlie Baker testified in December 2024 that he knows of fewer than ten transgender college student athletes among 510,000 athletes total.\n\n04.04.2025  Targeted transgender people and health care in a proclamation declaring April National Child Abuse Prevention Month. The proclamation is defamatory and without basis and betrays the month\u2019s purpose. Trump\u2019s proclamation singled out transgender care, and without basis, called it a form of child abuse. The proclamation does not address the most common risk factors for neglected or abused children.Transgender people exist, and every major medical association and leading world health authority supports health care for transgender people and youth.   \n\n03.24.2025  Announced attempt to terminate at least 68 grants to 46 institutions, many of which were for research on the health of LGBTQ people. The grants totaled nearly $40 million when awarded and are funded through Congressional budget appropriation, which the executive branch does not control. Most were in some way related to LGBTQ health, including research on HIV prevention. Other canceled studies centered on cancer, youth suicide, and bone health. The AP reports that, \u201cOne canceled project at Vanderbilt University had been following the overall health of more than 1,200 LGBTQ people age 50 and older.\u2026 \u2018We now no longer have anywhere studying LGBT cancer in the United States,\u2019\u201d a researcher noted.\n\n03.15.2025 Shut down the 83-year-old Voice of America (VOA) asserting that the venerable international broadcasting state media network had distributed \u201cradical propaganda,\u201d citing a March 2019 segment about transgender migrants seeking asylum in the United States. The Washington Post\u2018s fact checker described this as an \u201cordinary news story\u201d that was produced during the first Trump administration. The Trump administration has shut down VOA and other U.S.-funded media by placing nearly all staff on administrative leave and terminating contracts with affiliated broadcasters, effectively silencing operations that had promoted democracy globally for decades.\n\n03.07.2025 Signed an executive order directing administration officials to modify the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program to exclude nonprofit organizations engaged in activities he baselessly described as having a \u201csubstantial illegal purpose.\u201d The order to limit the program is aimed at organizations supporting immigrants, diversity initiatives, or transgender care for youth.\n\n03.07.2025 The Department of Defense is reportedly flagging content for removal via keyword search including \u201cgay,\u201d meaning references to the Enola Gay, an airplane that dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima, Japan, would be scrubbed. The AP reports the \u201cvast majority of the Pentagon purge targets women and minorities, including notable milestones made in the military. And it also removes a large number of posts that mention various commemorative months\u2014such as those for Black and Hispanic people and women.\u201d Additional content flagged includes a photo of an Army Corps of Engineer that had an engineer with the last name Gay, and a photo of Army Corps biologists \u201cseemingly because it mentioned they were recording data about fish\u2014including their weight, size, hatchery and gender.\u201d\n\n03.04.2025 Falsely claimed in his Address to Congress that he \u201cbrought back free speech in America.\u201d In fact, his administration has aggressively censored LGBTQ people and identities in executive orders, from federal websites, in health care, and from the Stonewall National Monument website. \n\n03.04.2025 Made the dangerous and misleading claim that $8 million in taxpayer dollars were going towards creating \u201ctransgender mice.\u201d In fact, this baseless claim comes from a far-right watchdog group. Transgenic mice are lab research mice that have been genetically altered to better model human disease response. They have been called a \u201crevolutionary research resource\u201d for medical advancements in asthma and cancer among other areas. \n\n03.04.2025 Falsely claimed the USA was giving \u201c$8 million to promote LGBTQI+ in the African nation of Lesotho, which nobody has ever heard of.\u201d In fact, the U.S. government does not support LGBTQ initiatives in Lesotho, but it does promote widely used health programs, particularly HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment. Trump has previously disparaged African countries and Haiti.\n\n03.04.2025 Touted his executive orders banning transgender women from sports and cited anti-transgender advocate Payton McNabb, a former volleyball player injured during a match against an alleged trans player. In fact, more than 214,000 female student athletes have been injured playing volleyball since 2012, with the vast majority of accidents involving cisgender players.\n\n03.06.2025 Marked Women\u2019s History Month with a proclamation from the U.S. Embassy in Romania. The proclamation cited Trump administration policies that impinge on the right of some people to have passports that accurately reflect their gender identities, to restrict some women from participating in sports, and to seek to define \u201csex\u201d in a way that excludes transgender women from the protections of civil rights laws. Trump\u2019s own history with women includes nominating the Supreme Court justices who helped overturn the federal protections of Roe, and a jury found Trump liable for sexually abusing E. Jean Carroll in 1996, awarding her $5 million. In a leaked 2005 Access Hollywood tape, Trump was recorded bragging about kissing and groping women without their consent. Trump defended several political allies accused of sexual misconduct or domestic abuse, including his first nominee for Attorney General Matt Gaetz, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., and Education Secretary Linda McMahon who is accused of enabling child sex assault when she led the WWE. More than 40 women have publicly accused Trump of various forms of sexual misconduct since the 1970s.\n\n02.19.2025 Rolled out a new HHS webpage, titled \u201cProtecting Women and Children,\u201d that employs Trump\u2019s narrow and scientifically baseless definition of sex and asserts that gender-affirming care is a form of child abuse. The department is promoting a rigid definition of sex that excludes transgender identities, falsely framing gender-affirming care as \u201cchemical and surgical mutilation\u201d and targeting trans inclusion in sports. In fact, every major medical association and leading world health authority supports health care for transgender people and youth. The site section titled \u201cKeeping Men Out of Women\u2019s Sports,\u201d repeats far-right rhetoric used to justify bans on transgender women athletes. \n\n02.18.2025 Added a baseless disclaimer to the top of government websites for the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control, and the Health and Human Services after a federal judge ordered that web pages that contained vital information about trans people and other marginalized groups be reinstated. The pages were posted again with a false header that reads, \u201cAny information on this page promoting gender ideology is extremely inaccurate and disconnected from the immutable biological reality that there are two sexes, male and female\u2026 The Trump Administration rejects gender ideology and condemns the harms it causes to children, by promoting their chemical and surgical mutilation, and to women, by depriving them of their dignity, safety, well-being, and opportunities. This page does not reflect biological reality and therefore the Administration and this Department reject it.\u201d The statement is false and contradicts global medical standards defining gender and sex. Transgender people exist. Every major medical association and leading world health authority supports health care for transgender people and youth.  \n\n02.14.2025 National Park Service removes the word \u201ctransgender\u201d from the Stonewall National Monument website. Transgender people were central in the Stonewall Riots and remain essential in the past, present and future of the LGBTQ movement.\n\n02.10.2025 Signed an executive order to target mainstream essential health care for transgender youth, using inaccurate and inflammatory graphic language. The care is supported by every major medical association and has been prescribed for decades, including throughout the first Trump administration. The order was blocked by a federal judge and prohibits federal agencies from conditioning or withholding federal funding based on the fact that a healthcare entity or professional provides gender-affirming medical care to a patient under nineteen.\n\n02.10.2025 Removed \u201cT\u201d from State Department travel advisory website which now only offers guidance for \u201cLGB\u201d travelers.\n\n02.07.2025 Department of Justice directs federally-funded nonprofit organizations including the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) to remove references to transgender people from public materials. The Verge reported that three reports previously on the NCMEC website had become inaccessible, each of which mentioned LGBTQ people. LGBTQ youth are among the most vulnerable to housing insecurity, violence, and abuse.\n\n02.04.2025 Paused foreign development assistance, including HIV drug supply to USAID-supported countries. Marco Rubio, as Secretary of State, has been put in charge of USAID while Pete Marocco, a Trump appointee, manages the defunding and dismantling of USAID programs. USAID supported HIV treatment and prevention programs, including PEPFAR, which provided lifesaving treatment to millions of people in 54 countries. In addition to HIV programs, USAID supported the rights of LGBTQ people in Dominican Republic, Uganda, Bangladesh, Kosovo, and Guatemala, and worked with LGBTQ populations across Central Asia, the Middle East, and North Africa.\n\n02.04.2025 Froze applications for the gender-neutral \u201cX\u201d marker on U.S. passports. The option had been added in 2021 by the Biden administration. Several countries worldwide already offer options other than male and female on official documents. India, Pakistan and Nepal already have a nonbinary option, and  the Netherlands issued its first gender-neutral passport in 2018.\n\n02.02.2025 Directed schools to stop using federal funding for purposes related to \u201cgender ideology.\u201d Transgender people are real, and not an ideology. More here on the origins of the phrase used to dehumanize trans people.\n\n01.27.2025 Signed an executive order directing the Secretary of Defense to reinstate a ban on transgender people serving in the military. This policy prohibits transgender people from enlisting, bars currently serving transgender personnel from transitioning, and ends the use of authentic pronouns. The order revokes Biden\u2019s policies that had allowed transgender troops to serve openly and access transition-related medical care and reversed protections for LGBTQ people in military service, education, housing, and federal employment.\n\n01.23.2025 Moved some transgender women in prisons to administrative isolation and mandated that transgender women prisoners be detained in men\u2019s prisons. \n\n01.23.2025 Falsely claimed, among multiple baseless claims and wild exaggerations in a speech to global leaders at the World Economic Forum, that \u201cthere are only two genders, male and female. And we will have no men participating in women\u2019s sports and transgender operations, which became the rage, will occur very rarely.\u201d Facts: Science and medicine as well as cultures throughout history have long acknowledged wider diversity of gender. Transgender women are women, and sometimes play sports. \u201cTransgender operations\u201d are already quite rare.\n\n01.20.2025 Signed an executive order revoking multiple Biden-era policies. This order revoked an executive order that addressed discrimination based on gender identity or sexual orientation. \n\n01.20.2025 Ordered an end to Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) programs across the federal government, putting such staff on immediate administrative leave.\n\n01.20.2025 The Trump administration has eliminated nearly all LGBTQ and HIV focused content and resources from the White House website, as well as eliminated LGBTQ and HIV content from key federal agency webpages. Mentions of \u201clesbian,\u201d \u201cbisexual,\u201d \u201cgay,\u201d \u201ctransgender,\u201d \u201csexual orientation,\u201d \u201cgender identity,\u201d and related terms are no longer accessible on WhiteHouse.gov, and the search term \u201cLGBTQ\u201d now brings up zero results on the site. In addition, some LGBTQ-specific pages have been taken down from the Centers for Disease Control, Department of State, and more. \n\n01.20.2025 Signed an executive order declaring that the federal government would recognize only two immutable sexes: male and female. The order aims to  prevent taxpayer funds from being used for gender-transition health care and add \u201cprivacy in intimate spaces\u201d in facilities such as prisons, migrant shelters and rape shelters. In fact, the development of the human body is a complex process, and sex is not solely determined by anatomy, nor is it strictly binary. As many as 1.7% of people are born with an intersex trait.\n\n2024\n10.28.2024 Repeatedly referred to CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper as \u201cAllison\u201d at a rally in Michigan when Cooper\u2019s town hall with Vice President Kamala Harris came up. The anti-LGBTQ and misogynistic rhetoric evokes the trope of gay men as effeminate, suggesting that gay men are women and that being a woman is degrading.\n\n10.13.2024 Aired a anti-transgender campaign ad that pictured Vice President Kamala Harris superimposed with transgender members of the Biden administration and a scene lifted from the television show Orange Is the New Black of inmates in prison jumpsuits. \u201cKamala supports taxpayer funded sex changes for prisoners and illegal aliens. Kamala is for they/them. President Trump is for you.\u201d The assertion echoes a statement Trump made in the presidential debate with Harris: \u201cNow she wants to do transgender operations on illegal aliens that are in prison.\u201d In fact, by law the government must provide medical care to prisoners and immigrant detainees. During Trump\u2019s presidency, officials at the Bureau of Prisons, which operates under the Justice Department, facilitated transgender health care for a limited number of incarcerated individuals who sought such care. This policy was implemented throughout Trump\u2019s four-year term, despite his administration\u2019s public stance on transgender issues.\n\n09.10.24. In the presidential debate Trump said, \u201cNow [Kamala Harris] wants to do transgender operations on illegal aliens that are in prison.\u201d In fact, by law the government must provide medical care to prisoners and immigrant detainees. During Trump\u2019s presidency, officials at the Bureau of Prisons, which operates under the Justice Department, facilitated transgender health care for a limited number of incarcerated people who sought such care. This policy was implemented during Trump\u2019s term.\n\n09.04.2024 Lied about access to gender-affirming care for minors, saying at a Moms for Liberty summit, \u201cThink of it, your kid goes to school and comes home a few days later with an operation\u2026.The school decides what\u2019s going to happen with your child.\u201d The statement is a false, gross misrepresentation of the highly regulated process of transgender health care for minors in the United States. No children are going to school and receiving surgery there for gender dysphoria.\n\n08.02.2024 In an interview at The National Association of Black Journalists conference he falsely questioned Vice President Kamala Harris\u2018 racial identity, claiming she \u201chappened to turn Black\u201d a few years ago and suggesting she previously only promoted her Indian heritage. The lie echos his previous racist remarks, such as the \u201cbirther\u201d conspiracy theories he promoted against former President Barack Obama.\n\n07.18.2024 During 90-minute nomination acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention, he repeats baseless disinformation about transgender women and girls participating in sports. GLAAD\u2019s Voter Poll shows a majority of voters in all parties oppose \u201ca political candidate [who] speaks frequently about restricting access to health care and participation in sports for transgender youth.\u201d\n\n07.10.2024  Campaign website includes formal policy plans called \u201cAgenda 47\u201d that includes a pledge titled \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s Plan to Protect Children From Left-Wing Gender Insanity.\u201d The Advocate reports, \u201cTrump promised to outlaw gender-affirming care for minors at the federal level, and \u2018cease all programs that promote the concept of sex and gender transition at any age.\u2019 He also promised to ban transgender athletes from competing on teams that match their gender identity.\u2026 Trump stated that he \u2018will ask Congress to pass a bill establishing that the only genders recognized by the United States government are male and female \u2014 and they are assigned at birth.\u2019 He then claimed that being transgender was \u2018invented\u2019 by the \u2018radical left,\u2019 though he did not use the term \u2018transgender\u2019 once throughout Agenda 47.\u201d\n\n06.21.24  Announced that if elected for a second term, he would cut federal funding for inclusive schools: \u201cOn day one, I will sign a new executive order to cut Federal funding of any school pushing critical race theory, transgender insanity, and other inappropriate racial, sexual, or political content onto the lives of our children.\u201d He also announced his intent to target transgender people in sports.\n\n05.17.2024 Recommitted to criminalizing abortion, telling Time that he would not intervene in decisions to monitor or prosecute pregnant people. He refused to say whether his second administration would enforce the Comstock Act, an 1873 \u201czombie law\u201d that bans the mailing of \u201cobscene\u201d materials, including birth control and \u201cinstruments\u201d used for abortions. The act has been unenforceable for the past 50 or so years, largely because it was rendered unconstitutional by Roe v. Wade, which Trump has repeatedly taken credit for overturning.\n\n05.14.2024 Vowed to roll back Title IX protections for transgender student enacted in April 2024 by the U.S. Department of Education \u201con day one,\u201d if he\u2019s reelected. Trump said: \u201cWe\u2019re going to end it on day one. Don\u2019t forget, that was done as an order from the president. That came down as an executive order. And we\u2019re going to change it\u2014on day one it\u2019s going to be changed\u2026. It\u2019ll be terminated.\u201d\n\n04.08.2024 Stated his current position on abortion on his social media platform in a video saying, \u201cMy view is now that we have abortion where everyone wanted it from a legal standpoint, the states will determine by vote or legislation, or perhaps both. And whatever they decide must be the law of the land. In this case, the law of the state.\u201d In the same video he made the baseless claim that Democrats want to legalize the \u201cexecution\u201d of babies that were already born, which is not true. Trump\u2019s position on abortion rights has changed many times from saying he is \u201cvery pro-choice\u201d in 1999, to personally taking credit for overturning Roe vs. Wade in 2022, to saying Florida\u2019s six-week abortion ban is \u201ca terrible mistake\u201d in 2023, to saying he would \u201cbe open\u201d to a 15 week ban in 2024.\n\n04.04.2024 Announced he would declare November 5 to be \u201cChristian Visibility Day\u201d after a baseless complaint about Transgender Day of Visibility coinciding with Easter in 2024. Previously Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt issued a statement calling it \u201cappalling and insulting\u201d that Biden \u201cformally proclaimed Easter Sunday as \u2018Trans Day of Visibility.\u2019 \u201d\n\n03.16.2024 Defended Ohio Senate primary candidate Bernie Moreno, whose email address was used to create an account on Adult Friend Finder in 2008 seeking \u201cmen for 1-on-1 sex.\u201d Moreno\u2019s campaign said the account was created by an intern as a prank. Trump defended Moreno and claimed \u201cDemocratic fake treatment\u201d for the story Moreno\u2019s campaign had confirmed: \u201cWe all know this man. He\u2019s a hero, he\u2019s a winner and we\u2019re not going to let these people \u2014 these people are sick.\u201d\n\n03.16.2024 Appeared at a campaign rally for Ohio Senate primary candidate Bernie Moreno, sponsored by the pro-Moreno Buckeye Values PAC. The PAC released an ad targeting a Moreno rival as \u201ca champion for trans equality.\u201d The PAC also reportedly sent campaign mail asking \u201cWhat Team Does Frank LaRose Play For?\u201d and \u201cIs he with us \u2026 Or is he with they/them?\u201d\n\n03.04.2024 Endorsed North Carolina Lt. Governor Mark Robinson for governor, despite Robinson\u2019s history of anti-LGBTQ disinformation and rhetoric, including calling gay people \u201cfilth\u201d and \u201cmaggots.\u201d Trump repeated his past claims that Robinson is \u201cbetter than Martin Luther King\u201d and \u201cMartin Luther King on steroids.\u201d \n\n02.02.2024 Used vulgar slang to refer to LGBTQ legal icon Roberta Kaplan, who represented E. Jean Carroll against Trump. Trump was found liable for sexually abusing Carroll in the 1990s and for defaming her by mocking her claims after he left the White House. A jury awarded Carroll with $83 million in damages. Kaplan recalled leading the deposition of Trump, saying that at the end Trump\u2019s lawyers asked to go \u201coff the record,\u201d meaning what he said would not be included on the court deposition transcript. Kaplan said Trump then said to her: \u201cSee you next Tuesday,\u201d a slang term referring to a word for female genitalia used as an insult for women.\n\n02.20.2024 Supported by the anti-LGBTQ national organization Heritage Foundation with a 180-page document detailing regulations and executive orders to be taken in first days in office, including: \u201cdeleting [from federal agencies and federal rule] the terms sexual orientation and gender identity (\u201cSOGI\u201d), diversity, equity, and inclusion., gender, gender equality, gender equity, gender awareness, gender-sensitive, abortion, reproductive health, reproductive rights;\u201d limiting abortion access with executive orders using the Comstock Act \u2014 a long-inactive 19th century law that banned birth control and abortion medication by mail. Semafor reported: While Project 2025 bills itself as being \u201ccandidate agnostic,\u201d [project director Paul] Dans noted that at this point in the primary, they expect \u201cand hope\u201d that Donald Trump will ultimately end up in office again. NBC News reported that Project 2025 includes representatives from anti-LGBTQ, anti-equality and anti-democracy groups \u201cled by veterans of the Trump administration, such as America First Legal, the Center for Renewing America and the Conservative Partnership Institute, the Claremont Institute, the Family Research Council and the Independent Women\u2019s Forum.\u201d (Links to groups added by GLAAD).\n\n01.10.2024 Boasted of his role in the Supreme Court decision ending the right to abortion by nominating three of the justices who joined the decision: \u201cIf it weren\u2019t for me, with Roe v. Wade, you wouldn\u2019t even be talking about this stuff. For 54 years they were trying to get Roe v. Wade terminated, and I did it and I\u2019m proud to have done it,\u201d Trump said. Abortion is an LGBTQ issue: LGBTQ people can and do get pregnant, lesbian young women are two to ten times more likely to become pregnant than heterosexual youth, lesbian and bisexual women are often at higher risk of sexual assault due in part to their sexual orientation, which may also result in an unplanned pregnancy. \n\n2023\n12.30.2023 Criticized Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine for vetoing state bill banning essential health care for transgender youth and banning trans youth from school sports, spread disinformation about the care and school sports. DeWine had said his veto was based on conversations he had with parents, patients and providers who told him how the care saves lives. Trump said in a Truth Social post: \u201cDeWine has fallen to the Radical Left\u2026 What was he thinking. The bill would have stopped child mutilation, and prevented men from playing in women\u2019s sports. Legislature will hopefully overturn. Do it FAST!!!\u201d Ohio hospitals and providers, along with hundreds of others, had testified that they do not perform surgeries on youth, and Ohio\u2019s school sports association has long had policies to ensure inclusive participation of transgender students.\n\n12.17.2023 Announced on social media, \u201cOn Day One [of a second term if he were reelected President], I will sign a new executive order to cut federal funding for any school pushing Critical Race Theory, transgender insanity, and other inappropriate racial, sexual, or political content on our children\u2026\u201d\n\n11.03.2023 Mimicked a Canadian weightlifter in an extended campaign event skit to mock and misgender transgender women in sports, claiming he will \u201cend this on day one\u201d if he\u2019s re-elected.\n\n09.13.2023 In \u201cAgenda47: President Trump\u2019s Ten Principles For Great Schools Leading To Great Jobs\u201d on Trump\u2019s campaign web site, he disparaged transgender people and includes misinformation about gender in eight of the ten principles. The Agenda targets LGBTQ people, particularly transgender people, by opposing gender-affirming care, restricting teachers from supporting transgender students, defining gender strictly as binary and assigned at birth, and eliminating LGBTQ-inclusive curricula. These policies aim to remove recognition and support for transgender identities in education and healthcare while promoting a restrictive view of gender and sexuality.\n\n05.17.2023 Proudly stated, \u201cI was able to kill Roe v. Wade,\u201d taking credit for the Supreme Court overturning the national right to an abortion in the Dobbs decision. The Dobbs decision suggested that the right to same-sex marriage should be reconsidered by the Court as well. \n\n06.11.2023 Said of transgender athletes at a rally, \u201cWho would even think that you can allow this? Who would say that this is okay? These people are sick. They are deranged\u2026. It\u2019s astonishing how passionately people react to that. When you talk about tax cuts, they remain calm. But when you mention transgender issues, everyone goes wild. Who would have imagined five years ago that they wouldn\u2019t even know what \u2018it\u2019 meant?\u201d\n\n04.14.2023 Said that if re-elected, he would use the government to investigate and potentially halt transgender health care during a National Rifle Association (NRA) speech. \u201cUpon my inauguration, I will direct the FDA to convene an independent outside panel to investigate whether transgender hormone treatments and ideology increase the risk of extreme depression, aggression and even violence,\u201d said Trump. He also accused Democrats of \u201cpushing the transgender cult\u201d on children.\n\n03.26.2023 Vowed to crack down on \u201ctransgender insanity\u201d and pledged to \u201crevoke every Biden policy promoting the disfigurement of our youth\u201d at the first rally of his 2024 presidential campaign. He said that he would \u201ckeep men out of women\u2019s sports\u201d if re-elected president, after he last year misgendered transgender athlete Lia Thomas. He added: \u201cI will immediately sign an executive order to cut federal funding for any school pushing critical race theory, transgender insanity, and other racial, sexual or political content on our children.\u201d\n\n01.31.2023 Made multiple false claims about gender affirming care, tweeting a so-called \u201cPlan to Protect Children from Left-Wing Gender Insanity.\u201c Every major medical association and world health authority supports gender affirming care; statements here including from the American Academy of Pediatrics: \u201cThere is strong consensus among the most prominent medical organizations worldwide that evidence-based, gender-affirming care for transgender children and adolescents is medically necessary and appropriate. It can even be lifesaving. The decision of whether and when to start gender-affirming treatment, which does not necessarily lead to hormone therapy or surgery, is personal and involves careful consideration by each patient and their family.\u201d\n\n01.29.2023 At a campaign event, falsely claimed and without evidence or fact: \u201cWe\u2019re going to stop the left-wing radical racists and perverts who are trying to indoctrinate our youth, and we\u2019re going to get their Marxist hands off our children\u2026We\u2019re going to defeat the cult of gender ideology and reaffirm that God created two genders: men and women. We\u2019re not going to allow men to play women\u2019s sports.\u201d\n\n01.26.2023 Released so-called education policy that cuts federal funding for any school or program that includes \u201ccritical race theory, gender ideology, or other inappropriate racial, sexual, or political content onto our children.\u201d",

  "full_text": "Trump Accountability Tracker255 attacks ON LGBTQ PEOPLE 2025\n04.15.2025  Sent a memo to lawmakers requesting that Congress rescind $1.1 billion in federal funding from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which contributes money to NPR and PBS. The funding is already appropriated by Congress. Public broadcasters like NPR and PBS have a track record of airing programming that highlights LGBTQ stories, issues, and communities,  providing representation and education often not found on commercial networks. The White House memo advocating for the cuts specifically criticized PBS for airing programs featuring transgender characters.\n\n04.04.2025  Issued a proclamation recognizing National Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month that erroneously claims that assaults by undocumented immigrants are one of the leading causes of sexual violence. In fact, eight out of 10 rapes are committed by someone known to the victim, according to data from the Department of Justice. Previous proclamations emphasized support for survivors and perpetrator accountability. Trump was found liable for sexual abuse in 2023. \n\n04.04.2025  Created a new Title IX Special Investigations Team focused on preventing transgender women and girls from women\u2019s and girls\u2019 sports teams and restrooms. The Departments of Education and Justice jointly said that this team will \u201cprotect students, and especially female athletes, from the pernicious effects of gender ideology in school programs and activities.\u201d Title IX was enacted by Congress in 1972 to protect students from discrimination \u201con the basis of sex.\u201d NCAA President Charlie Baker testified in December 2024 that he knows of fewer than ten transgender college student athletes among 510,000 athletes total.\n\n04.04.2025  Targeted transgender people and health care in a proclamation declaring April National Child Abuse Prevention Month. The proclamation is defamatory and without basis and betrays the month\u2019s purpose. Trump\u2019s proclamation singled out transgender care, and without basis, called it a form of child abuse. The proclamation does not address the most common risk factors for neglected or abused children.Transgender people exist, and every major medical association and leading world health authority supports health care for transgender people and youth.   \n\n03.24.2025  Announced attempt to terminate at least 68 grants to 46 institutions, many of which were for research on the health of LGBTQ people. The grants totaled nearly $40 million when awarded and are funded through Congressional budget appropriation, which the executive branch does not control. Most were in some way related to LGBTQ health, including research on HIV prevention. Other canceled studies centered on cancer, youth suicide, and bone health. The AP reports that, \u201cOne canceled project at Vanderbilt University had been following the overall health of more than 1,200 LGBTQ people age 50 and older.\u2026 \u2018We now no longer have anywhere studying LGBT cancer in the United States,\u2019\u201d a researcher noted.\n\n03.15.2025 Shut down the 83-year-old Voice of America (VOA) asserting that the venerable international broadcasting state media network had distributed \u201cradical propaganda,\u201d citing a March 2019 segment about transgender migrants seeking asylum in the United States. The Washington Post\u2018s fact checker described this as an \u201cordinary news story\u201d that was produced during the first Trump administration. The Trump administration has shut down VOA and other U.S.-funded media by placing nearly all staff on administrative leave and terminating contracts with affiliated broadcasters, effectively silencing operations that had promoted democracy globally for decades.\n\n03.07.2025 Signed an executive order directing administration officials to modify the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program to exclude nonprofit organizations engaged in activities he baselessly described as having a \u201csubstantial illegal purpose.\u201d The order to limit the program is aimed at organizations supporting immigrants, diversity initiatives, or transgender care for youth.\n\n03.07.2025 The Department of Defense is reportedly flagging content for removal via keyword search including \u201cgay,\u201d meaning references to the Enola Gay, an airplane that dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima, Japan, would be scrubbed. The AP reports the \u201cvast majority of the Pentagon purge targets women and minorities, including notable milestones made in the military. And it also removes a large number of posts that mention various commemorative months\u2014such as those for Black and Hispanic people and women.\u201d Additional content flagged includes a photo of an Army Corps of Engineer that had an engineer with the last name Gay, and a photo of Army Corps biologists \u201cseemingly because it mentioned they were recording data about fish\u2014including their weight, size, hatchery and gender.\u201d\n\n03.04.2025 Falsely claimed in his Address to Congress that he \u201cbrought back free speech in America.\u201d In fact, his administration has aggressively censored LGBTQ people and identities in executive orders, from federal websites, in health care, and from the Stonewall National Monument website. \n\n03.04.2025 Made the dangerous and misleading claim that $8 million in taxpayer dollars were going towards creating \u201ctransgender mice.\u201d In fact, this baseless claim comes from a far-right watchdog group. Transgenic mice are lab research mice that have been genetically altered to better model human disease response. They have been called a \u201crevolutionary research resource\u201d for medical advancements in asthma and cancer among other areas. \n\n03.04.2025 Falsely claimed the USA was giving \u201c$8 million to promote LGBTQI+ in the African nation of Lesotho, which nobody has ever heard of.\u201d In fact, the U.S. government does not support LGBTQ initiatives in Lesotho, but it does promote widely used health programs, particularly HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment. Trump has previously disparaged African countries and Haiti.\n\n03.04.2025 Touted his executive orders banning transgender women from sports and cited anti-transgender advocate Payton McNabb, a former volleyball player injured during a match against an alleged trans player. In fact, more than 214,000 female student athletes have been injured playing volleyball since 2012, with the vast majority of accidents involving cisgender players.\n\n03.06.2025 Marked Women\u2019s History Month with a proclamation from the U.S. Embassy in Romania. The proclamation cited Trump administration policies that impinge on the right of some people to have passports that accurately reflect their gender identities, to restrict some women from participating in sports, and to seek to define \u201csex\u201d in a way that excludes transgender women from the protections of civil rights laws. Trump\u2019s own history with women includes nominating the Supreme Court justices who helped overturn the federal protections of Roe, and a jury found Trump liable for sexually abusing E. Jean Carroll in 1996, awarding her $5 million. In a leaked 2005 Access Hollywood tape, Trump was recorded bragging about kissing and groping women without their consent. Trump defended several political allies accused of sexual misconduct or domestic abuse, including his first nominee for Attorney General Matt Gaetz, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., and Education Secretary Linda McMahon who is accused of enabling child sex assault when she led the WWE. More than 40 women have publicly accused Trump of various forms of sexual misconduct since the 1970s.\n\n02.19.2025 Rolled out a new HHS webpage, titled \u201cProtecting Women and Children,\u201d that employs Trump\u2019s narrow and scientifically baseless definition of sex and asserts that gender-affirming care is a form of child abuse. The department is promoting a rigid definition of sex that excludes transgender identities, falsely framing gender-affirming care as \u201cchemical and surgical mutilation\u201d and targeting trans inclusion in sports. In fact, every major medical association and leading world health authority supports health care for transgender people and youth. The site section titled \u201cKeeping Men Out of Women\u2019s Sports,\u201d repeats far-right rhetoric used to justify bans on transgender women athletes. \n\n02.18.2025 Added a baseless disclaimer to the top of government websites for the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control, and the Health and Human Services after a federal judge ordered that web pages that contained vital information about trans people and other marginalized groups be reinstated. The pages were posted again with a false header that reads, \u201cAny information on this page promoting gender ideology is extremely inaccurate and disconnected from the immutable biological reality that there are two sexes, male and female\u2026 The Trump Administration rejects gender ideology and condemns the harms it causes to children, by promoting their chemical and surgical mutilation, and to women, by depriving them of their dignity, safety, well-being, and opportunities. This page does not reflect biological reality and therefore the Administration and this Department reject it.\u201d The statement is false and contradicts global medical standards defining gender and sex. Transgender people exist. Every major medical association and leading world health authority supports health care for transgender people and youth.  \n\n02.14.2025 National Park Service removes the word \u201ctransgender\u201d from the Stonewall National Monument website. Transgender people were central in the Stonewall Riots and remain essential in the past, present and future of the LGBTQ movement.\n\n02.10.2025 Signed an executive order to target mainstream essential health care for transgender youth, using inaccurate and inflammatory graphic language. The care is supported by every major medical association and has been prescribed for decades, including throughout the first Trump administration. The order was blocked by a federal judge and prohibits federal agencies from conditioning or withholding federal funding based on the fact that a healthcare entity or professional provides gender-affirming medical care to a patient under nineteen.\n\n02.10.2025 Removed \u201cT\u201d from State Department travel advisory website which now only offers guidance for \u201cLGB\u201d travelers.\n\n02.07.2025 Department of Justice directs federally-funded nonprofit organizations including the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) to remove references to transgender people from public materials. The Verge reported that three reports previously on the NCMEC website had become inaccessible, each of which mentioned LGBTQ people. LGBTQ youth are among the most vulnerable to housing insecurity, violence, and abuse.\n\n02.04.2025 Paused foreign development assistance, including HIV drug supply to USAID-supported countries. Marco Rubio, as Secretary of State, has been put in charge of USAID while Pete Marocco, a Trump appointee, manages the defunding and dismantling of USAID programs. USAID supported HIV treatment and prevention programs, including PEPFAR, which provided lifesaving treatment to millions of people in 54 countries. In addition to HIV programs, USAID supported the rights of LGBTQ people in Dominican Republic, Uganda, Bangladesh, Kosovo, and Guatemala, and worked with LGBTQ populations across Central Asia, the Middle East, and North Africa.\n\n02.04.2025 Froze applications for the gender-neutral \u201cX\u201d marker on U.S. passports. The option had been added in 2021 by the Biden administration. Several countries worldwide already offer options other than male and female on official documents. India, Pakistan and Nepal already have a nonbinary option, and  the Netherlands issued its first gender-neutral passport in 2018.\n\n02.02.2025 Directed schools to stop using federal funding for purposes related to \u201cgender ideology.\u201d Transgender people are real, and not an ideology. More here on the origins of the phrase used to dehumanize trans people.\n\n01.27.2025 Signed an executive order directing the Secretary of Defense to reinstate a ban on transgender people serving in the military. This policy prohibits transgender people from enlisting, bars currently serving transgender personnel from transitioning, and ends the use of authentic pronouns. The order revokes Biden\u2019s policies that had allowed transgender troops to serve openly and access transition-related medical care and reversed protections for LGBTQ people in military service, education, housing, and federal employment.\n\n01.23.2025 Moved some transgender women in prisons to administrative isolation and mandated that transgender women prisoners be detained in men\u2019s prisons. \n\n01.23.2025 Falsely claimed, among multiple baseless claims and wild exaggerations in a speech to global leaders at the World Economic Forum, that \u201cthere are only two genders, male and female. And we will have no men participating in women\u2019s sports and transgender operations, which became the rage, will occur very rarely.\u201d Facts: Science and medicine as well as cultures throughout history have long acknowledged wider diversity of gender. Transgender women are women, and sometimes play sports. \u201cTransgender operations\u201d are already quite rare.\n\n01.20.2025 Signed an executive order revoking multiple Biden-era policies. This order revoked an executive order that addressed discrimination based on gender identity or sexual orientation. \n\n01.20.2025 Ordered an end to Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) programs across the federal government, putting such staff on immediate administrative leave.\n\n01.20.2025 The Trump administration has eliminated nearly all LGBTQ and HIV focused content and resources from the White House website, as well as eliminated LGBTQ and HIV content from key federal agency webpages. Mentions of \u201clesbian,\u201d \u201cbisexual,\u201d \u201cgay,\u201d \u201ctransgender,\u201d \u201csexual orientation,\u201d \u201cgender identity,\u201d and related terms are no longer accessible on WhiteHouse.gov, and the search term \u201cLGBTQ\u201d now brings up zero results on the site. In addition, some LGBTQ-specific pages have been taken down from the Centers for Disease Control, Department of State, and more. \n\n01.20.2025 Signed an executive order declaring that the federal government would recognize only two immutable sexes: male and female. The order aims to  prevent taxpayer funds from being used for gender-transition health care and add \u201cprivacy in intimate spaces\u201d in facilities such as prisons, migrant shelters and rape shelters. In fact, the development of the human body is a complex process, and sex is not solely determined by anatomy, nor is it strictly binary. As many as 1.7% of people are born with an intersex trait.\n\n2024\n10.28.2024 Repeatedly referred to CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper as \u201cAllison\u201d at a rally in Michigan when Cooper\u2019s town hall with Vice President Kamala Harris came up. The anti-LGBTQ and misogynistic rhetoric evokes the trope of gay men as effeminate, suggesting that gay men are women and that being a woman is degrading.\n\n10.13.2024 Aired a anti-transgender campaign ad that pictured Vice President Kamala Harris superimposed with transgender members of the Biden administration and a scene lifted from the television show Orange Is the New Black of inmates in prison jumpsuits. \u201cKamala supports taxpayer funded sex changes for prisoners and illegal aliens. Kamala is for they/them. President Trump is for you.\u201d The assertion echoes a statement Trump made in the presidential debate with Harris: \u201cNow she wants to do transgender operations on illegal aliens that are in prison.\u201d In fact, by law the government must provide medical care to prisoners and immigrant detainees. During Trump\u2019s presidency, officials at the Bureau of Prisons, which operates under the Justice Department, facilitated transgender health care for a limited number of incarcerated individuals who sought such care. This policy was implemented throughout Trump\u2019s four-year term, despite his administration\u2019s public stance on transgender issues.\n\n09.10.24. In the presidential debate Trump said, \u201cNow [Kamala Harris] wants to do transgender operations on illegal aliens that are in prison.\u201d In fact, by law the government must provide medical care to prisoners and immigrant detainees. During Trump\u2019s presidency, officials at the Bureau of Prisons, which operates under the Justice Department, facilitated transgender health care for a limited number of incarcerated people who sought such care. This policy was implemented during Trump\u2019s term.\n\n09.04.2024 Lied about access to gender-affirming care for minors, saying at a Moms for Liberty summit, \u201cThink of it, your kid goes to school and comes home a few days later with an operation\u2026.The school decides what\u2019s going to happen with your child.\u201d The statement is a false, gross misrepresentation of the highly regulated process of transgender health care for minors in the United States. No children are going to school and receiving surgery there for gender dysphoria.\n\n08.02.2024 In an interview at The National Association of Black Journalists conference he falsely questioned Vice President Kamala Harris\u2018 racial identity, claiming she \u201chappened to turn Black\u201d a few years ago and suggesting she previously only promoted her Indian heritage. The lie echos his previous racist remarks, such as the \u201cbirther\u201d conspiracy theories he promoted against former President Barack Obama.\n\n07.18.2024 During 90-minute nomination acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention, he repeats baseless disinformation about transgender women and girls participating in sports. GLAAD\u2019s Voter Poll shows a majority of voters in all parties oppose \u201ca political candidate [who] speaks frequently about restricting access to health care and participation in sports for transgender youth.\u201d\n\n07.10.2024  Campaign website includes formal policy plans called \u201cAgenda 47\u201d that includes a pledge titled \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s Plan to Protect Children From Left-Wing Gender Insanity.\u201d The Advocate reports, \u201cTrump promised to outlaw gender-affirming care for minors at the federal level, and \u2018cease all programs that promote the concept of sex and gender transition at any age.\u2019 He also promised to ban transgender athletes from competing on teams that match their gender identity.\u2026 Trump stated that he \u2018will ask Congress to pass a bill establishing that the only genders recognized by the United States government are male and female \u2014 and they are assigned at birth.\u2019 He then claimed that being transgender was \u2018invented\u2019 by the \u2018radical left,\u2019 though he did not use the term \u2018transgender\u2019 once throughout Agenda 47.\u201d\n\n06.21.24  Announced that if elected for a second term, he would cut federal funding for inclusive schools: \u201cOn day one, I will sign a new executive order to cut Federal funding of any school pushing critical race theory, transgender insanity, and other inappropriate racial, sexual, or political content onto the lives of our children.\u201d He also announced his intent to target transgender people in sports.\n\n05.17.2024 Recommitted to criminalizing abortion, telling Time that he would not intervene in decisions to monitor or prosecute pregnant people. He refused to say whether his second administration would enforce the Comstock Act, an 1873 \u201czombie law\u201d that bans the mailing of \u201cobscene\u201d materials, including birth control and \u201cinstruments\u201d used for abortions. The act has been unenforceable for the past 50 or so years, largely because it was rendered unconstitutional by Roe v. Wade, which Trump has repeatedly taken credit for overturning.\n\n05.14.2024 Vowed to roll back Title IX protections for transgender student enacted in April 2024 by the U.S. Department of Education \u201con day one,\u201d if he\u2019s reelected. Trump said: \u201cWe\u2019re going to end it on day one. Don\u2019t forget, that was done as an order from the president. That came down as an executive order. And we\u2019re going to change it\u2014on day one it\u2019s going to be changed\u2026. It\u2019ll be terminated.\u201d\n\n04.08.2024 Stated his current position on abortion on his social media platform in a video saying, \u201cMy view is now that we have abortion where everyone wanted it from a legal standpoint, the states will determine by vote or legislation, or perhaps both. And whatever they decide must be the law of the land. In this case, the law of the state.\u201d In the same video he made the baseless claim that Democrats want to legalize the \u201cexecution\u201d of babies that were already born, which is not true. Trump\u2019s position on abortion rights has changed many times from saying he is \u201cvery pro-choice\u201d in 1999, to personally taking credit for overturning Roe vs. Wade in 2022, to saying Florida\u2019s six-week abortion ban is \u201ca terrible mistake\u201d in 2023, to saying he would \u201cbe open\u201d to a 15 week ban in 2024.\n\n04.04.2024 Announced he would declare November 5 to be \u201cChristian Visibility Day\u201d after a baseless complaint about Transgender Day of Visibility coinciding with Easter in 2024. Previously Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt issued a statement calling it \u201cappalling and insulting\u201d that Biden \u201cformally proclaimed Easter Sunday as \u2018Trans Day of Visibility.\u2019 \u201d\n\n03.16.2024 Defended Ohio Senate primary candidate Bernie Moreno, whose email address was used to create an account on Adult Friend Finder in 2008 seeking \u201cmen for 1-on-1 sex.\u201d Moreno\u2019s campaign said the account was created by an intern as a prank. Trump defended Moreno and claimed \u201cDemocratic fake treatment\u201d for the story Moreno\u2019s campaign had confirmed: \u201cWe all know this man. He\u2019s a hero, he\u2019s a winner and we\u2019re not going to let these people \u2014 these people are sick.\u201d\n\n03.16.2024 Appeared at a campaign rally for Ohio Senate primary candidate Bernie Moreno, sponsored by the pro-Moreno Buckeye Values PAC. The PAC released an ad targeting a Moreno rival as \u201ca champion for trans equality.\u201d The PAC also reportedly sent campaign mail asking \u201cWhat Team Does Frank LaRose Play For?\u201d and \u201cIs he with us \u2026 Or is he with they/them?\u201d\n\n03.04.2024 Endorsed North Carolina Lt. Governor Mark Robinson for governor, despite Robinson\u2019s history of anti-LGBTQ disinformation and rhetoric, including calling gay people \u201cfilth\u201d and \u201cmaggots.\u201d Trump repeated his past claims that Robinson is \u201cbetter than Martin Luther King\u201d and \u201cMartin Luther King on steroids.\u201d \n\n02.02.2024 Used vulgar slang to refer to LGBTQ legal icon Roberta Kaplan, who represented E. Jean Carroll against Trump. Trump was found liable for sexually abusing Carroll in the 1990s and for defaming her by mocking her claims after he left the White House. A jury awarded Carroll with $83 million in damages. Kaplan recalled leading the deposition of Trump, saying that at the end Trump\u2019s lawyers asked to go \u201coff the record,\u201d meaning what he said would not be included on the court deposition transcript. Kaplan said Trump then said to her: \u201cSee you next Tuesday,\u201d a slang term referring to a word for female genitalia used as an insult for women.\n\n02.20.2024 Supported by the anti-LGBTQ national organization Heritage Foundation with a 180-page document detailing regulations and executive orders to be taken in first days in office, including: \u201cdeleting [from federal agencies and federal rule] the terms sexual orientation and gender identity (\u201cSOGI\u201d), diversity, equity, and inclusion., gender, gender equality, gender equity, gender awareness, gender-sensitive, abortion, reproductive health, reproductive rights;\u201d limiting abortion access with executive orders using the Comstock Act \u2014 a long-inactive 19th century law that banned birth control and abortion medication by mail. Semafor reported: While Project 2025 bills itself as being \u201ccandidate agnostic,\u201d [project director Paul] Dans noted that at this point in the primary, they expect \u201cand hope\u201d that Donald Trump will ultimately end up in office again. NBC News reported that Project 2025 includes representatives from anti-LGBTQ, anti-equality and anti-democracy groups \u201cled by veterans of the Trump administration, such as America First Legal, the Center for Renewing America and the Conservative Partnership Institute, the Claremont Institute, the Family Research Council and the Independent Women\u2019s Forum.\u201d (Links to groups added by GLAAD).\n\n01.10.2024 Boasted of his role in the Supreme Court decision ending the right to abortion by nominating three of the justices who joined the decision: \u201cIf it weren\u2019t for me, with Roe v. Wade, you wouldn\u2019t even be talking about this stuff. For 54 years they were trying to get Roe v. Wade terminated, and I did it and I\u2019m proud to have done it,\u201d Trump said. Abortion is an LGBTQ issue: LGBTQ people can and do get pregnant, lesbian young women are two to ten times more likely to become pregnant than heterosexual youth, lesbian and bisexual women are often at higher risk of sexual assault due in part to their sexual orientation, which may also result in an unplanned pregnancy. \n\n2023\n12.30.2023 Criticized Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine for vetoing state bill banning essential health care for transgender youth and banning trans youth from school sports, spread disinformation about the care and school sports. DeWine had said his veto was based on conversations he had with parents, patients and providers who told him how the care saves lives. Trump said in a Truth Social post: \u201cDeWine has fallen to the Radical Left\u2026 What was he thinking. The bill would have stopped child mutilation, and prevented men from playing in women\u2019s sports. Legislature will hopefully overturn. Do it FAST!!!\u201d Ohio hospitals and providers, along with hundreds of others, had testified that they do not perform surgeries on youth, and Ohio\u2019s school sports association has long had policies to ensure inclusive participation of transgender students.\n\n12.17.2023 Announced on social media, \u201cOn Day One [of a second term if he were reelected President], I will sign a new executive order to cut federal funding for any school pushing Critical Race Theory, transgender insanity, and other inappropriate racial, sexual, or political content on our children\u2026\u201d\n\n11.03.2023 Mimicked a Canadian weightlifter in an extended campaign event skit to mock and misgender transgender women in sports, claiming he will \u201cend this on day one\u201d if he\u2019s re-elected.\n\n09.13.2023 In \u201cAgenda47: President Trump\u2019s Ten Principles For Great Schools Leading To Great Jobs\u201d on Trump\u2019s campaign web site, he disparaged transgender people and includes misinformation about gender in eight of the ten principles. The Agenda targets LGBTQ people, particularly transgender people, by opposing gender-affirming care, restricting teachers from supporting transgender students, defining gender strictly as binary and assigned at birth, and eliminating LGBTQ-inclusive curricula. These policies aim to remove recognition and support for transgender identities in education and healthcare while promoting a restrictive view of gender and sexuality.\n\n05.17.2023 Proudly stated, \u201cI was able to kill Roe v. Wade,\u201d taking credit for the Supreme Court overturning the national right to an abortion in the Dobbs decision. The Dobbs decision suggested that the right to same-sex marriage should be reconsidered by the Court as well. \n\n06.11.2023 Said of transgender athletes at a rally, \u201cWho would even think that you can allow this? Who would say that this is okay? These people are sick. They are deranged\u2026. It\u2019s astonishing how passionately people react to that. When you talk about tax cuts, they remain calm. But when you mention transgender issues, everyone goes wild. Who would have imagined five years ago that they wouldn\u2019t even know what \u2018it\u2019 meant?\u201d\n\n04.14.2023 Said that if re-elected, he would use the government to investigate and potentially halt transgender health care during a National Rifle Association (NRA) speech. \u201cUpon my inauguration, I will direct the FDA to convene an independent outside panel to investigate whether transgender hormone treatments and ideology increase the risk of extreme depression, aggression and even violence,\u201d said Trump. He also accused Democrats of \u201cpushing the transgender cult\u201d on children.\n\n03.26.2023 Vowed to crack down on \u201ctransgender insanity\u201d and pledged to \u201crevoke every Biden policy promoting the disfigurement of our youth\u201d at the first rally of his 2024 presidential campaign. He said that he would \u201ckeep men out of women\u2019s sports\u201d if re-elected president, after he last year misgendered transgender athlete Lia Thomas. He added: \u201cI will immediately sign an executive order to cut federal funding for any school pushing critical race theory, transgender insanity, and other racial, sexual or political content on our children.\u201d\n\n01.31.2023 Made multiple false claims about gender affirming care, tweeting a so-called \u201cPlan to Protect Children from Left-Wing Gender Insanity.\u201c Every major medical association and world health authority supports gender affirming care; statements here including from the American Academy of Pediatrics: \u201cThere is strong consensus among the most prominent medical organizations worldwide that evidence-based, gender-affirming care for transgender children and adolescents is medically necessary and appropriate. It can even be lifesaving. The decision of whether and when to start gender-affirming treatment, which does not necessarily lead to hormone therapy or surgery, is personal and involves careful consideration by each patient and their family.\u201d\n\n01.29.2023 At a campaign event, falsely claimed and without evidence or fact: \u201cWe\u2019re going to stop the left-wing radical racists and perverts who are trying to indoctrinate our youth, and we\u2019re going to get their Marxist hands off our children\u2026We\u2019re going to defeat the cult of gender ideology and reaffirm that God created two genders: men and women. We\u2019re not going to allow men to play women\u2019s sports.\u201d\n\n01.26.2023 Released so-called education policy that cuts federal funding for any school or program that includes \u201ccritical race theory, gender ideology, or other inappropriate racial, sexual, or political content onto our children.\u201d",
