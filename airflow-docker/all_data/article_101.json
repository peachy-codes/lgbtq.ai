  "content": "Chris Mosier is an out transgender athlete, and a trailblazer, and he\u2019s speaking out about President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order that seeks to ban transgender athletes from competing in women\u2019s and girl\u2019s school-sponsored sports.\n\nMosier told CNN, \u201cSports has just been the entry point to other areas of discrimination against our community, including health care access, safety in schools, removing things from school curriculum about transgender people, and so on.\u201d\n\nMosier is the first transgender athlete to represent the United States in international competition, first transgender athlete in the ESPN Body Issue, and first transgender athlete sponsored by Nike. He\u2019s also the first transgender athlete to qualify for the Olympic Trials in the gender they identify.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no evidence that trans athletes have an advantage over anyone else in sports,\u201d Mosier continued. \u201cTrans athletes play sports for the same reasons as anybody else. For our love of the game, to be a part of a team, to challenge ourselves, and most of all, at the youth level, to have fun. And every young person deserves that opportunity to be their authentic self and to play the sports they love without compromising any part of who they are.\u201d\n\nLike many of the Trump executive orders, there are inherent contradictions and inconsistencies. The executive order gives instructions to the Department of Education, which President Trump has already strongly hinted he wants to close, and that legally must happen through a law passed in Congress. It threatens to defund education institutions that permit transgender athletes to participate in sports. The order falsely claims that including trans participation is a violation of Title IX, the federal legislation that prohibits sex-based discrimination in educational settings. In essence, it is encouraging discrimination by weaponizing protections against discrimination to target transgender people. \n\nNCAA President Charlie Baker testified in December that he knew of \u201cless than 10\u201d transgender collegiate athletes out of 510,000 total. He did not specify how many of those athletes are transgender women, who are specifically targeted by the order. The NCAA announced on Feb. 6, the day after Trump signed the nonbinding executive order, that its Board of Governors voted to update the Association\u2019s participation policy for transgender student-athletes. The new policy limits competition in women\u2019s sports to student-athletes assigned female at birth only.\nThe decision was made without consulting the NCAA\u2019s board of medical experts that has advised the NCAA for years on safety and fairness. Dr. Jack Turban announced he is resigning from the NCAA Committee on Competitive Safeguards and Medical Aspects of Sports, stating: \u201cIt is clear that your decision was based on politics and not science, as the CSMAS was not consulted prior to the decision.\u201d\n\nThere is no evidence of a need for this new policy, or the need to immediately implement it. Instruction from the Department of Education to educational institutions that would guide the policy and its enforcement will likely take months and then will be subject to legal scrutiny.\n\nThe administration currently has no Secretary of Education, and its nominee, has yet to answer questions about her role in accusations of enabling sexual assault and exploitation of children. \n\nTransgender people have been playing sports for decades. The NCAA and International Olympic Committee (IOC) have developed scientifically-based guidelines to ensure fairness and inclusion for at least a decade. And research shows states that include transgender participation have more girls participating in sports than states with bans.\n\nSports bans are part of a systematic and expanding targeting of transgender people and youth that has surged to include their medically-necessary and supported health care, book bans and curriculum bans, and access to the restroom. This ban follows executive orders that challenges the right of out trans people to serve in the military, and the right of transgender people to receive health care. \n\n\u201cSo we can see that this is a part of a larger picture,\u201d Mosier said. \u201cAnd the talking point of trying to ban trans women and girls from girls and women\u2019s sports has just been so incredibly divisive that it\u2019s been what they\u2019ve latched onto to kick off discrimination against our community.\u201d\n\nJournalist and activist for transgender rights Raquel Willis spoke to ABC News about the ban: \u201cThis has never really been about trans women and girls in sports. This has always been about trying to erase us from society, from access to health care, employment, education, safety and security. We are not going to let this happen. Trans folks and the folks who love us and support us and understand our brilliance are rising up.\u201d\n\nWillis continued, \u201cI want us to see the connections around all of the attacks, the attacks on our immigrant family, our undocumented immigrant family, that is part and parcel of the attacks on transgender people. The attacks on our passports\u2014right now we\u2019re not able to change our gender to have our true identity reflected there, that is a document and security that ties us to the fights against immigrants right now. The attacks on DEI\u2014if you have an administration who says you don\u2019t exist, how are you going to get a job? We need a culture of deeper empathy.\u201d\n\nGLAAD also responded to the proposed ban: \u201cThis administration\u2019s latest inaccurate and incoherent piece of paper smears an entire group of Americans but does not change the law or the facts. All women and girls, including transgender women and girls, should be welcome to play sports if they want, make decisions about their own bodies, be hired for jobs they are qualified for, and be free from lawless attacks by extremists in elected office.\u201d\n\nMany of Trump\u2019s executive orders have been blocked in court as unconstitutional and illegal. Multiple orders are being challenged in court.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s record of targeting LGBTQ people is documented on the Trump Accountability Tracker.",
