She was invited as one of President Donald Trump\u2019s guests to his address to a joint session of Congress earlier this year because she suffered a concussion, brain bleed, and other trauma when a male athlete spiked a volleyball violently directly into her face.

Not only is there concern for physical harm in competition, but trans policies also create the opportunity for violence when females are forced to share restrooms and locker rooms with males, or sleep in the same room with them during overnight team trips.\n\nIn Bondi\u2019s lawsuit announcement on Wednesday, she acknowledged the injuries, saying, \u201cSome of these young women have endured vicious injuries, too, as a result of boys playing in their sports.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese boys are allowed to go in women\u2019s restrooms, they are allowed to go in the women\u2019s dressing rooms and get fully naked and change \u2014 biological boys \u2014 and change clothes in front of these young women,\u201d she said. \u201cMaine\u2019s leadership has refused to comply at every turn, so now, we have no other choice: We are taking them to court.\u201d\n\nGov. Janet Mills, D-Maine, who has been obstinate in her quest to ensure the highest amount of harm comes to women and girls within the scope of Title IX, issued a statement in response to the lawsuit, saying in part, \u201cThis matter has never been about school sports or the protection of women and girls, as has been claimed, it is about states rights and defending the rule of law against a federal government bent on imposing its will, instead of upholding the law.\u201d\n\nMaine has been claiming that the right to allow men in women\u2019s sports is fully in line with Title IX, despite the fact that the law was expressly passed to protect women\u2019s opportunities in education and sports.
