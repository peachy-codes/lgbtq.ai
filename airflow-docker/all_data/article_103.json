The Stonewall Uprising \u2013 a monumental moment in the fight for LGBTQ rights \u2013 would not have happened without the leadership of transgender and gender non-conforming people. The tireless work of Marsha P. Johnson, Sylvia Rivera, and countless other trans women of color paved the way and continue to inspire us. You can try to erase our history, but we will never forget those who came before us and we will continue to fight for all those who will come after us.\u201d\n\nStatement from The Stonewall Inn Gives Back Initiative and The Stonewall Inn\n\n\u201cThe Stonewall Inn and The Stonewall Inn Gives Back Initiative are outraged and appalled by the recent removal of the word \u2018transgender\u2019 from the Stonewall National Monument page on the National Park Service website. This blatant act of erasure not only distorts the truth of our history, but it also dishonors the immense contributions of transgender individuals \u2014 especially transgender women of color \u2014 who were at the forefront of the Stonewall Riots and the broader fight for LGBTQ+ rights.\n\nLet us be clear: Stonewall is transgender history. Marsha P. Johnson, Sylvia Rivera, and countless other trans and gender-nonconforming individuals fought bravely, and often at great personal risk, to push back against oppressive systems. Their courage, sacrifice, and leadership were central to the resistance we now celebrate as the foundation of the modern LGBTQ+ rights movement.\n\nThis decision to erase the word \u2018transgender\u2019 is a deliberate attempt to erase our history and marginalize the very people who paved the way for many victories we have achieved as a community. It is a direct attack on transgender people, especially transgender women of color, who continue to face violence, discrimination, and erasure at every turn.\n\nWe demand the immediate restoration of the word \u2018transgender\u2019 on the Stonewall National Monument website. We will not stand by while the legacies of our transgender siblings are erased from the history books. The Stonewall Inn and The Stonewall Inn Gives Back Initiative stands unwaveringly in solidarity with the transgender community and all who fight for full equality, and we will not rest until this grave injustice is corrected.\u201d\n\nReporters covering this topic are encouraged to review GLAAD\u2019s recent article \u2013 Trump Administration Removes LGBTQ and HIV resources from White House and Other Government Websites.",
