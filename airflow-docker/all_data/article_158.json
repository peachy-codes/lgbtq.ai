That year, she joined Hollywood director Judd Apatow and transgender activists in going after the New York Times over its coverage of transgender children. They honed in on an article that exposed school administrators who encourage minors to change their gender behind their parents\u2019 backs.\n\nDunham, of course, was a spokeswoman for the Clinton campaign in 2016. She hit the stump for the Democratic candidate in Iowa and New Hampshire, spoke in primetime at the Democratic National Committee, and headlined rallies for Clinton just months before her loss to Donald Trump.",
