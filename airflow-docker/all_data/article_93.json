Civil rights attorneys say the arrest of Marcy Rheintgen last month is the first they know of for violating transgender bathroom restrictions passed by numerous state legislatures across the country.\n\nCapitol police had been alerted and were waiting for Rheintgen, 20, when she entered the building in Tallahassee March 19. They told her she would receive a trespass warning once she entered the women\u2019s restroom to wash her hands and pray the rosary, but she was later placed under arrest when she refused to leave, according to an arrest affidavit.\n\nRheintgen faces a misdemeanor trespassing charge punishable by up to 60 days in jail and is due to appear in court in May.\n\n\u201cI wanted people to see the absurdity of this law in practice,\u201d Rheintgen told The Associated Press. \u201cIf I\u2019m a criminal, it\u2019s going to be so hard for me to live a normal life, all because I washed my hands. Like, that\u2019s so insane.\u201d\n\nAt least 14 states have adopted laws barring transgender women from entering women\u2019s bathrooms at public schools and, in some cases, other government buildings. Only two \u2014 Florida and Utah \u2014 criminalize the act. A judge on Wednesday temporarily blocked Montana\u2019s new bathroom law.\n\nRheintgen\u2019s arrest in Florida is the first that American Civil Liberties Union attorneys are aware of in any state with a criminal ban, senior staff attorney Jon Davidson said.\n\nRheintgen was in town visiting her grandparents when she decided to pen a letter to each of Florida\u2019s 160 state lawmakers informing them of her plan to enter a public restroom inconsistent with her sex assigned at birth. The Illinois resident said her act of civil disobedience was fueled by anger at seeing a place she loves and visits regularly grow hostile toward trans people.\n\nTrump kept his promise to order a ban on trans female athletes. Court fights have followed.\n\u201cI know that you know in your heart that this law is wrong and unjust,\u201d she wrote in her letter to lawmakers. \u201cI know that you know in your heart that transgender people are human too, and that you can\u2019t arrest us away. I know that you know that I have dignity. That\u2019s why I know that you won\u2019t arrest me.\u201d\n\nHer arrest comes as many Republican-led states that have enacted restroom restrictions grapple with how to enforce them. Laws in Alabama, Kansas, Kentucky and North Dakota do not spell out any enforcement mechanism, and even the state laws that do largely rely on private individuals to report violations.\n\nIn Utah, activists flooded a tip line created to alert state officials to possible violations of its bathroom law with thousands of hoax reports in an effort to shield transgender residents and their allies from any legitimate complaints that could lead to an investigation.\n\nThe Republican sponsors of the Florida bathroom law, Rep. Rachel Plakon and Sen. Erin Grall, did not immediately respond Thursday to phone messages, emails and visits to their offices to seek comment on Rheintgen\u2019s arrest. They have said the restrictions are needed to protect women and girls in single-sex spaces.\n\nOpponents of the law such as Nadine Smith, executive director of the LGBTQ+ advocacy group Equality Florida, said it creates dangerous situations for all by giving people license to police others\u2019 bodies in bathrooms.\n\n\u201cThe arrest of Marcy Rheintgen is not about safety,\u201d Smith said. \u201cIt\u2019s about cruelty, humiliation and the deliberate erosion of human dignity. Transgender people have been using restrooms aligned with their gender for generations without incident. What\u2019s changed is not their presence \u2014 it\u2019s a wave of laws designed to intimidate them out of public life.\u201d\n\nIf Rheintgen is convicted, she worries she could be jailed with men, forced to cut her long hair and prevented temporarily from taking gender-affirming hormones.\n\n\u201cPeople are telling me it\u2019s a legal test, like this is the first case that\u2019s being brought,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s how they test the law. But I didn\u2019t do this to test the law. I did it because I was upset. I can\u2019t have any expectations for what\u2019s going to happen because this has never been prosecuted before. I\u2019m horrified and scared.\u201d",
