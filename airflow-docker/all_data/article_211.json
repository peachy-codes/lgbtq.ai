The specter of state lawmakers or even parents hindering or discouraging children from \u201ctransitioning\u201d seems to haunt trans activists, who view recent political efforts to ban so-called \u201cgender-affirming care\u201d in some states as the worst sort of tyranny. Children, in their view, have a right to transition, and any obstacle placed in their way, even by parents, is a gross injustice crying out for redress.\n\nUp until recently, this argument was simmering just below the surface of the transgender discourse in America. It was the subtext first of the bathroom debate, then of the debate over girls\u2019 sports, then of the debate over the role teachers and public schools are playing in transing kids socially without informing parents, and finally of state laws restricting transgender surgeries, puberty blockers, and other treatments for minors. In each case, the unstated argument was that minors who believe they are trans should be allowed to transition, socially and medically, and no one, not even their parents, should have the right to stop them.\n\nNow that argument is out in the open \u2014 declared in bold black letters against a blood-red field on the latest cover of New York Magazine: \u201cFreedom of Sex, the moral case for letting trans kids change their bodies.\u201d\n\nThe author of the piece is a man named Andrea Long Chu, the magazine\u2019s Pulitzer Prize-winning literary critic and a self-identified lesbian \u201ctrans woman,\u201d who by his own admission was persuaded of this particular gender identity after becoming addicted to pornography \u2014 specifically to something called \u201csissy porn,\u201d which encourages men to \u201cfeminize\u201d and sexually humiliate themselves.\n\nChu has probably done more than anyone else in recent years to mainstream transgenderism, mostly through his 2019 book, Females, which chronicles his dark obsession with sissy porn. I won\u2019t quote it here, but suffice it to say, it makes for unpleasant reading (even in small excerpts). To give you a sense of this person, he was aptly described by Peachy Keenan on Twitter this week as \u201ca radical trans activist who is an obese man who now calls himself a lesbian and has a neovagina.\u201d\n\nWhat better spokesman, then, for the idea that children should be allowed to undergo an array of surgical procedures and drug therapies, even against their parents\u2019 wishes or without their knowledge. Chu\u2019s argument relies on holding up bizarre anecdotes and medical anomalies as normative and quoting radical gender theorists from the 1970s. The essay itself is weighed down with the intentionally opaque academic jargon of gender studies, which makes reading it an unhappy chore. So I\u2019ll save you the trouble: His main point is that we need to jettison the idea that youth transgenderism is something that can be diagnosed by medical experts, that it requires one to meet any sort of criteria, and that it even has a cause. It is simply a fact of modern life that we must all accept.\n\n\u201cWe will never be able to defend the rights of transgender kids until we understand them purely on their own terms: as full members of society who would like to change their sex,\u201d he writes. \u201cWe must be prepared to defend the idea that, in principle, everyone should have access to sex-changing medical care, regardless of age, gender identity, social environment, or psychiatric history.\u201d\n\nThis is a radical argument that carries an equally radical agenda. Among other things, it means there is no point to the political debates now raging over girls\u2019 sports, the legality of \u201cgender-affirming care\u201d for youth, and pretty much everything else related to the transgender movement. The \u201canti-trans bloc,\u201d writes Chu, has \u201ctargeted children because Americans tend to imagine children both as a font of pure, unadulterated humanity and as ignorant dependents incapable of rational thought or political agency.\u201d\n\nNever mind that children by definition are rightly incapable of political agency; they are in the charge of their parents, who exercise political agency on their behalf. Nor are they entirely capable of rational thought, which is why we don\u2019t allow them to vote or drink alcohol or get tattoos.\n\nBut such realities are brushed aside by Chu, who insists that \u201cthe freedom to bring sex and gender into whatever relation one chooses is a basic human right,\u201d and that we cannot deny this right to children.\n\nInterestingly, Chu\u2019s primary target here is liberals, not conservatives \u2014 readers of The New York Times and The Atlantic. He calls them \u201ctrans-agnostic reactionary liberal,\u201d or TARLs, whose primary concern is the illiberality of the trans movement itself and its habit of \u201ctrafficking in censorship, intimidation, and quasi-religious fanaticism. On trans people themselves, the TARL claims to take no position other than to voice his general empathy for anyone suffering from psychological distress or civil-rights violations.\u201d\n\nThey err, he says, in supposing that there is any psychological distress behind a person\u2019s desire to transition, or that transitioning is something we should tolerate for those who really need it but certainly not encourage. Reconceiving of transgenderism as a basic human right means getting away from that kind of thinking and clearing the public square of these debates entirely.\n\nIn practice, he says, this means a kind of radical laissez-fair policy when it comes to things like castration and sterilization and the entire smorgasbord of \u201ctreatments\u201d now on offer for those who identify as transgender. \u201cLet anyone change their sex,\u201d says Chu. \u201cLet anyone change their gender. Let anyone change their sex again. Let trans girls play sports, regardless of their sex status. If they excel, this means only that some girls are better at sports than others.\u201d\n\nThere is something deeply wrong with the reasoning here, as if reality itself can offer no resistance to the ideology of self-creation that Chu would enshrine in our polity. In the concluding paragraphs, he makes statements like, \u201c[I]f children are too young to consent to puberty blockers, then they are definitely too young to consent to puberty, which is a drastic biological upheaval in its own right.\u201d\n\nThe conflation of powerful drugs like puberty blockers with the natural process of puberty is not just a disfigurement of reason, it is an assault on the idea that there is a natural order at all. It is a claim of human will and desire over and against reality itself, an assault on the givenness of the created order. In secular terms, one might call it delusional or fantastic. In Christian terms, one should rightly call it Satanic. \n\nTrans kids, writes Chu, \u201care busy taking charge of their own creation\u201d \u2014 that is, themselves. The idea that we can \u201ccreate\u201d ourselves is popular among trans activists, including AI-addled transhumanists. But it\u2019s also popular among ordinary liberals and unreligious, uncatechized modern people who generally like the idea that we all make ourselves into what we are.\n\nTherein lies the strategy behind Chu\u2019s approach. He is appealing to a bias embedded in the liberal worldview, an assumption that we are not limited by a created order, much less a Creator. It\u2019s a clever ploy because, at the end of the day, liberals have no answer to this argument. They must accept its premise \u2014 that every person can create his own truth, and indeed has a right to his own truth \u2014 or fall back on some notion of natural law, which necessarily implies a created natural order and all that it entails.\n\nChu and the trans movement for which he speaks are betting that liberals will not be able to resist what amounts to an extension of liberals\u2019 own logic. They are betting, smartly, that most of them lack the theological vocabulary to apprehend the old lie from the Garden, now disguised in the modern verbiage of rights and identities: You will not surely die, you will become like God.",
