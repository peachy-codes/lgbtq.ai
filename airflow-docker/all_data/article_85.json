It now heads to the Assembly floor for a second reading.\n\nThe \u201cKelly Loving Act,\u201d named for a trans-identifying man who was killed in the 2022 Colorado nightclub shooting, targets parents who do not affirm their child\u2019s new gender identity.\n\nIn child custody decisions, \u201ca court shall consider deadnaming, misgendering, or threatening to publish material related to an individual\u2019s gender-affirming health-care services as types of coercive control,\u201d the bill reads.\n\n\u201cCoercive control\u201d also includes things like threatening to kill someone or forcing someone to commit crimes under Colorado law.\n\nThe bill also bars Colorado courts from cooperating with other states\u2019 laws that remove a child from their parent because the parent allowed the child to receive transgender medical services like puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones, or surgery.\n\nThe bill also says that school policies allowing children to use a different name must be \u201cinclusive of all reasons that a student might adopt a chosen name.\u201d Also, school dress codes must not \u201cenforce any rules based on gender,\u201d according to the bill.\n\n\u201cDeadnaming\u201d and \u201cmisgendering\u201d would officially be \u201cdiscriminatory acts\u201d under Colorado law if the bill passes.\n\nState Rep. Jarvis Caldwell, a Republican, called attention to the bill on social media and told The Daily Wire that Democrats introduced the bill \u201clate Friday evening after we went home for the weekend.\u201d\n\nUsually lawmakers would have at least two weeks to prepare before a bill goes to committee, but this time Republicans had less than 24 hours to prepare despite Democrats apparently having the bill in the works for over a year, he said.\n\nThe bill has many \u201cserious concerns,\u201d he said, including targeting both parents and private business owners who misgender someone.\n\n\u201cIn my opinion, the goal is to eliminate the ability of a parent to seek treatment for gender confusion and dysphoria,\u201d Caldwell said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen many radical bills this legislative session, but this is by far the most egregious. At a minimum, it attacks parental rights, local control, the U.S. Constitution, and more specifically, the First Amendment.\u201d\n\nCaldwell said the bill is likely to become law soon.\n\nLori Gimelshteyn, executive director of the Colorado Parent Advocacy Network called the bill an \u201cunconstitutional overreach that turns parenting\u2014a sacred duty to guide and protect your child\u2014into a punishable offense if it doesn\u2019t align with the state\u2019s agenda.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis bill redefines love, conviction, and parenting as \u2018coercive control\u2019 \u2014 and that\u2019s both dangerous and deeply wrong,\u201d Gimelshteyn told The Daily Wire. \u201cWhat kind of society are we becoming when a parent can lose custody of their child, not for abuse, neglect or endangerment, but for using the name they gave their child at birth?\u201d\n\nGimelshteyn spoke in formal opposition to the bill during Tuesday\u2019s Judiciary Committee hearing. Also speaking were two other women, Mia Hughes, senior researcher at Genspect, and Erin Lee, executive director of Protect Kids Colorado, who spoke in her personal capacity.\n\n\u201cThere are consequences to lying to a child,\u201d Hughes told lawmakers. \u201cA parent telling their sweet, effeminate boy who likes Barbies and princess gowns that he can be a girl may solve his distress in the short term \u2026 but this is short-sighted.\u201d\n\nHughes explained that the data shows most children will desist and identity as their birth sex again, but this \u201cnatural process\u201d is interrupted if a parent affirms the child\u2019s cross-sex identity.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy to turn a little boy into a convincing girl just by putting him in a dress and giving him a girl\u2019s name, but the illusion becomes unsustainable when testosterone begins to surge, so now he must medicalize,\u201d she said, citing the often permanent harms of puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones, and genital surgery.\n\nLee said her sixth grade daughter was \u201csecretly transitioned\u201d at her school, convinced that her \u201cnormal pubescent discomfort\u201d meant she was actually a transgender boy, and affirming her only caused her more mental distress.\n\n\u201cIf this law was in place four years ago when CPS came to my door for non-affirmation I would have lost my child,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cParents have long been bullied by the suicide myth: that you must transition your child or else they will kill themself. Now the state is adding to that: transition your child or else we will take them from you,\u201d Lee told The Daily Wire. \u201cThis will harm so many fathers who are fighting their ex-spouses medicalizing their children against their will in Colorado. It fortifies our status as a wrong-sex mutilation sanctuary state, encouraging more people to move here and transition their children.\u201d\n\nShe said Democrats appear to be trying to quickly pass the bill before critics can mount a response.\n\n\u201cDemocrats are seemingly trying to pass this in the night, so quickly that we don\u2019t have time to read the bill or organize testimony against it,\u201d she added. \u201cBut with 24 hours notice, more expert witnesses showed up to oppose than people who showed up to support this bill yesterday.\u201d\n\nColorado parents who oppose their children\u2019s transgender identities have found themselves in nightmare situations.\n\nEarlier this year, one Durango mother found the police would not help her retrieve her 17-year-old daughter from the house of her daughter\u2019s former math teacher and trans-identifying husband, who had taken the girl into her home.",
