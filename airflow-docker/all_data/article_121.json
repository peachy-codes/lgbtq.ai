Hurson in PFLAG v. Trump \u2014 a case brought by two LGBTQ+ advocacy groups, two trans young adults, and five trans adolescents and their families \u2014 means that the executive order will not be enforced as the litigation continues to play out. Hurson previously issued a temporary restraining order against the order in February, which blocked implementation of the order for two weeks before being extended to March 5.\n\nPresident Trump initially issued the executive order titled \u201cProtecting Children From Chemical and Surgical Mutilation\u201d on January 28. The ACLU, Lambda Legal, and several other organizations, including PFLAG and GLMA, subsequently filed a lawsuit on behalf of a group of young trans people and their families on February 4, arguing that the order is unconstitutional, and that the executive branch does not have the authority to control hospital funding in such a way without going through Congress. Even so, hospitals around the country preemptively cancelled appointments for gender-affirming care for trans youth.\n\nThe decision comes days after a federal judge in Seattle similarly granted an injunction against the executive order after previously granting a temporary restraining order. That injunction, however, applied only in Washington, Oregon, Minnesota, and Colorado, whose attorneys general had sued the Trump administration over the order.\n\nPeople gather to defend trans people rights in New York City on February 3, 2025. Hundreds of people protested in New York February 3 against US President Donald Trump's executive order signed January 28, 2025, to restrict gender transition procedures for people under the age of 19, and reports of a local hospital group cancelling appointments for young people in response.
