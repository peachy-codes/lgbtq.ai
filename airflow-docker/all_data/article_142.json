  "content": "Bridgerton star Nicola Coughlan has raised over \u00a370,000 (roughly $96,000) for the trans charity Not A Phase following the U.K. Supreme Court\u2019s Wednesday ruling that the legal definitions of \u201cman\u201d and \u201cwoman\u201d are based on a person\u2019s \u201cbiological sex.\u201d.\n\nThe ruling\u2019s long-ranging effects are still up in the air, but it is poised to have chilling, far-ranging effects on trans rights in the U.K. As legal researcher Jess O\u2019Thompson explained on LGBTQ+ news site Queer AF, trans people in the U.K. can now be excluded from all \u201csingle-sex\u201d spaces under any circumstances and cannot make equal pay claims.\n\nBritish anti-trans advocates have been publicly celebrating the news, including Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling, who posted a photo of herself enjoying a cigar and drink on X with the caption \u201cI love it when a plan comes together\u201d after reportedly donating over \u00a370,000 to For Women Scotland, the anti-trans organization that had brought the Supreme Court case forward. Yet other U.K. celebrities, like Coughlan, have wasted no time publicly reaffirming their support for the trans community in the ruling\u2019s aftermath.\n\nOn April 17, Coughlan took to Instagram to announce that she was launching a fundraiser for Not A Phase, a trans charity that aims to improve the lives of trans adults across the U.K. \u201cthrough awareness campaigning, social projects, and funding trans+ lead initiatives,\u201d per the organization\u2019s official website. The actress originally set a fundraising goal of \u00a310,000 and pledged to match donations up to that amount.\n\n\u201cTo see an already-marginalized community\u2026 be further attacked in law is really stomach turning and disgusting, and these people celebrating it [are] more stomach turning and disgusting,\u201d Coughlan said in a video. \u201cIf you are a cisgender person who is an ally of a trans person, I think now is the time to just\u2026 speak up and make your voice heard, and let your trans, nonbinary friends and just the community at large know that you\u2019re there for them and will keep fighting for them.\u201d\n\n\nJust an hour after launching the fundraiser, Coughlan shared on her Instagram Story that fans had already met her \u00a310,000 target. In just over 24 hours, the fundraiser has raised well over \u00a370,000 at the time of writing. She has since set a new fundraising goal of \u00a379,699.21 (roughly $105,725).\n\nCoughlan isn\u2019t the only cis U.K. celebrity who\u2019s spoken out on behalf of trans rights following the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling. On April 17, The White Lotus star Aimee Lou Wood re-shared a post from LGBTQ+ activist Ellen Jones to her Instagram Story denouncing the ruling.\n\n\u201cPure rage,\u201d Wood captioned her story. \u201cThis country is a hell hole.\u201d\n\nCoughlan\u2019s Bridgerton co-star, Charitha Chandran, also called out the ruling in an April 17 TikTok that has received over 2.3 million likes.\n\n\u201cHow pathetic to target one of the most oppressed groups in our society,\u201d Chandran said. \u201cHonestly? Loser behavior\u2026 You don\u2019t care about women. You just want to target those who are already oppressed.\u201d",
