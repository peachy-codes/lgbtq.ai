These are their records on LGBTQ issues: \n\nIn response to the question from PBS Wisconsin, \u201cDo trans people have any specific protections under the law? Are they a protected class? Do they get any other category of protection when it comes to them being singled out as a group?\u201d\n\nCrawford: \u201cThat is a question where if a case came in front of me, that was making an argument about the rights of transgender people or making a claim that they\u2019d been discriminated against or something like that, I would have to look at the law and see what protections were available, and hear out what the attorney\u2019s arguments were both for and against those kinds of protections. Obviously, look at the facts to see what was happening in that case. And then make a decision based on what I thought the facts and the law required.\u201d\nSchimel: \u201cUnder the law, they\u2019re not in a particular protected class, no, but in a courtroom, in the justice system, you don\u2019t have to be in a protected class to enjoy, to enjoy our constitutional rights. You know, I, I do name changes. Every Monday morning is when we hold name change hearings. And I have \u2014 it\u2019s routine that I have individuals who have transitioned or are transitioning, want to change their names. I respect them for that decision, and I make those name changes as a matter of routine. I\u2019ve even had some cases where they\u2019ve undergone gender change operation and want to change their birth certificate. The law provides that they can do that. That\u2019s what the law provides. My personal opinions have nothing to do with that.\u201d Crawford\u2019s LGBTQ history:\n\n\u201cRepresented Planned Parenthood in challenging, along with the state and national ACLU, a 2013 law signed by Republican Gov. Scott Walker that required abortion providers to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals.\u201d The ACLU noted \u201ca federal judge blocked the law,\u201d a decision that was upheld by a federal appeals court in both 2013 and 2015.\nCalled the 2022 overturning of Roe v. Wade \u201cwrongly decided,\u201d and noted it marked \u201cthe first time the court has ever taken away a right that was recognized and long vested under our United States Constitution.\u201d Crawford said she found it \u201cdeeply concerning \u2026 when the government starts invading some of those fundamental decisions that men and women make every day about how to live their lives and what\u2019s best for them and their families.\u201d\nIn an interview with The Daily Cardinal (University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison\u2019s student newspaper), Crawford told young voters she is \u201clooking to protect their rights under our Constitution and under our state laws and make sure that their fundamental freedoms are protected.\u201d Referencing Brad Schimel\u2019s remarks against reproductive freedom, she added, \u201cI think young people should be concerned about a candidate who has an extreme position like that and is so willing to take rights away from people.\u201d\nIn a guest column in The Cap Times, Crawford affirmed her commitment \u201cto protecting the fundamental rights and freedoms of all Wisconsinites.\u201d Drawing from her personal experience, Crawford said she \u201crepresented Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin and their doctors to protect women\u2019s access to reproductive health care services.\u201d\nSaid she prefers a \u201ccommon sense\u201d approach to reproductive rights rather than being labeled as \u201cpro-choice,\u201d a term she avoids \u201cbecause of its policy implications and the way it\u2019s been politicized.\u201d Schimel\u2019s LGBTQ history:\n\nIn 2014, while campaigning for attorney general, \u201cSchimel pledged to defend Wisconsin\u2019s ban on same-sex marriage and initially said he would refuse to uphold a 2009 state law granting domestic partnership benefits to same-sex couples.\u201d Schimel later shifted his position on the latter, but remained committed \u201cto enforcing the state\u2019s same-sex marriage ban.\u201d\nCompared same-sex couples to Nazi skinheads in describing the religious exemption rights of Masterpiece Cakeshop plaintiff who fought to the U.S. Supreme Court to discriminate against a gay couple shopping for a wedding cake: \u201cWhat if a person who is a minority owns a store and a couple of Nazi skinheads come in and demand that [the owner] provides a service?\u201d Schimel said. \u201cCan that person say no? I don\u2019t know that they can if the Supreme Court decides that [the bakery owner] can be forced to make this cake.\u201d \nAs attorney general, hired Misha Tseytlin to be solicitor general. Tseytlin \u201cplayed a central role in crafting the legal strategy to dismantle Roe v. Wade.\u201d Schimel has an extensive record of attacks against reproductive freedom and once said Wisconsin has no \u201cconstitutional right to abortion.\u201d\nAP: Wisconsin taxpayers paid about $1,000 to send one of Schimel\u2019s top lawyers to an event sponsored by Alliance Defending Freedom, a group with a long history of advocating against LGBTQ people and equality and a designated hate group by Southern Poverty Law Center. Schimel claimed the group only wants to make sure \u201cLGBTQ+ rights did not interfere with the rights of other people.\u201d\nAccused the Wisconsin Supreme Court\u2019s liberal, female majority of being \u201cdriven by their emotions\u201d in determining whether to uphold the state\u2019s 1849 abortion ban. \u201cYou could see it in their eyes, and you could hear it in the tone of their voice.\u201d\nAt a recent campaign event in Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, Schimel sided with business owners who wished to use religious grounds to turn away LGBTQ couples. When an \u201cattendee asked whether Schimel would do anything to protect \u2018those of us who don\u2019t want to hire or offer services\u2019 to people whose marriages \u2018violate our religious beliefs,\u2019 Schimel responded, \u2018Your religious rights need to be protected.\u2019\u201d In a 2017 interview with Wisconsin Eye, Schimel suggested that marriage equality could pave the way for LGBTQ couples to \u201ctake their right to be married and now infringe on the legitimate religious liberty beliefs or rights of a person who is an artist. This isn\u2019t going down to the corner grocery store and buying a box of Ding Dongs. This is somebody who creates art.\u201d In fact, the opposite happened: attempts at expanding religious exemptions to more scenarios to discriminate against LGBTQ people followed the narrow ruling in Masterpiece. Anti-LGBTQ legal group Alliance Defending Freedom reportedly shopped for plaintiffs to continue to challenge anti-discrimination laws in 303 Creative, featuring a web designer who had not been approached by any LGBTQ person or couple.\nExpressed willingness to enforce a ban on marriage equality if the U.S. Supreme Court overturns Obergefell v. Hodges. At a campaign event in Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, Schimel said: \u201cWe have a constitutional amendment that\u2019s still on the books.\u201d Schimel previously explained his personal beliefs on marriage equality in an interview with Eye on Oshkosh in 2014, 18 months before the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s Obergefell decision legalized marriage equality nationwide: \u201cAs I do my job as attorney general, my personal view on that issue has no business entering into the equation. My job as the state\u2019s lawyer is to defend Wisconsin\u2019s law \u2026 until the Supreme Court says it\u2019s unconstitutional or the people change it. So, you start with that, but my view is I favor traditional marriage: one man, one woman. That\u2019s my personal view in my personal life, and that\u2019s how I voted when the marriage amendment was on the ballot. Now, that doesn\u2019t mean that I don\u2019t accept that people of the same sex can be deeply in love with each other, and committed to each other. I wonder whether the government ought to be in the marriage business at all, and whether we ought to leave that to religion and other things.\u201d\nCriticized transgender singer Laura Jane Grace, who opened a Wisconsin rally held by Sen. Bernie Sanders with a performance of \u201cYour God.\u201d Schimel said the song was an \u201cabsolutely grotesque attack on people of faith.\u201d \nRan an anti-transgender ad campaign featuring a parent accusing Susan Crawford of supporting the \u201cradical agenda\u201d of special interests. \u201cLet transitioning males use my girls\u2019 bathrooms at school? Allow boys to compete against them in sports? Giving puberty-blocking drugs to children without parents\u2019 consent? That\u2019s who Susan Crawford sides with.\u201d\nRefused to comment on anti-transgender text messages from \u201cWin Wisconsin, Win the Future,\u201d a group which is not \u201cregistered with the state, the Federal Election Commission or the Internal Revenue Service.\u201d The texts ask if \u201cparents should have the right to know if their child is transitioning genders at school\u201d and warn \u201cISSUES LIKE THIS COULD BE DECIDED BY THE WI SUPREME COURT.\u201d\nFair Wisconsin, the state\u2019s only statewide LGBTQ+ civil rights and political advocacy organization, issued a statement on the election: \u201cBrad Schimel would be a dangerous addition to the Wisconsin Supreme Court because he poses a threat to our rights, both for the rights of Wisconsinites in general and for the LGBTQ+ community in particular. Schimel has recently launched an anti-trans attack ad, and I find his cynical attempt to sow fear by preying on our trans friends, family, and neighbors in Wisconsin absolutely disgusting. As I have said before in the face of anti-trans attacks, we cannot let these ugly ads work. People are not issues; children are not weapons; health care, safety, and support are for everyone. Every bill passed into law, and every decision made by a court has an impact on the LGBTQ+ community, and that is why we need to have a court we can rely on to protect our rights as Wisconsinites, including LGBTQ+ Wisconsinites \u2013 our rights to safety, health, and the freedom to live as our authentic selves and love who we love.\u201d\n\nGLAAD statement: \u201cAll elections are a chance for voters to use their voices, and the Wisconsin Supreme Court race is one with a ten-year impact on LGBTQ people as well as fairness and impartiality. Voters can review the LGBTQ records of the candidates to understand how they will defend or dismantle protections for LGBTQ people, as well as reproductive rights. The election on April 1 will have a profound and lasting influence on the safety and equality of all Wisconsinites.\u201d\n\nThe court is expected to decide the future of abortion in the state and could redraw a congressional map. \n\nIn addition, there is a proposed constitutional amendment on the ballot that seeks to embed Wisconsin\u2019s voter ID law into the state constitution. Wisconsin currently requires voters to present their photo ID in person at the polls.\n\nAccording to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, \u201cThe referendum isn\u2019t asking whether to get rid of or keep that law. It\u2019ll remain in place regardless of the referendum results.\u201d Instead, it seeks to permanently add the voter ID law into the state constitution.\nCrawford previously expressed opposition to the law and called it \u201cdraconian,\u201d but declined to share how she would vote. Schimel is in favor of the state\u2019s voter ID law and said he would support the resolution.\nStrict voter ID laws can create barriers for transgender people, \u201cboth because of difficulties in obtaining an ID that\u2019s accepted, or because they might run into bias or misunderstandings of the law when it comes to their gender.\u201d\nUnelected billionaire Elon Musk has endorsed Schimel and donated to groups that have reportedly spent more than $10 million in ads against Schimel\u2019s opponent, Susan Crawford (including one that used a photo of the wrong individual to represent Crawford). Investigative reporters have noted that the groups have posted Facebook ads making false claims about Crawford\u2019s position on cash bail. Crawford has not taken a position on cash bail.\n\nThe GLAAD ALERT Desk (Anti-LGBTQ Extremism Reporting Tracker) has documented 47 anti-LGBTQ incidents in Wisconsin since June 2022, including three bomb threats, three cases of vandalism, and two assaults. Examples include:\n\nOn Feb. 1, 2025, an individual mailed anti-LGBTQ letters to an LGBTQ person / former pastor at their home in Oak Creek, Wisconsin. The letters addressed the victim, calling them a \u201cqueer piece of sh*t.\u201d\nStarting on March 8, 2024, at least four bomb threats were called into Butler Middle School in Waukesha, Wisconsin. The threats followed a post by Libs of TikTok four days prior, which showed a school employee posting about his partner and saying: \u201cAcceptance, equity and inclusion should be cornerstones of our schools.\u201d\n(TW) On Feb. 26, 2023, an individual shot and killed a transgender woman at her apartment in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The perpetrator allegedly filmed her death while making anti-trans comments.",
