  "content": "Senate Democrats voted unanimously on Monday to block a Republican-led bill that would have banned federally funded schools from allowing trans athletes to compete in women\u2019s sports.\n\nThe party line vote was 51-45, with zero Democrats voting in favor. Four senators did not vote: Republican senators Shelley Moore (WV) and Cynthia Lummis (WY) and Democratic senators Elissa Slotkin (MI) and Peter Welch (VT). Although the Republican party has a majority in the Senate with 53 seats, the bill \u2014 deceitfully titled the \u201cProtection of Women and Girls in Sports Act\u201d \u2014 needed seven Democratic votes to reach the 60-vote threshold required for it to advance.\n\nThe Republican-majority House passed their own version of the bill in January with a 218-206 vote. Two House Democrats \u2014 Texas representatives Henry Cuellar and Vincente Gonzalez \u2014 voted in favor of the anti-trans measure, while one Democrat (North Carolina Rep. Donald G. Davis) voted \u201cpresent.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat Republicans are doing today is inventing a problem to stir up a culture war and divide people against each other,\u201d Hawaii Democrat Sen. Brian Schatz said on the floor on Monday, per The Hill.\n\n\u201cI, for one, trust our states, our leagues, our localities to make these decisions [about women\u2019s sports] without interference from Congress or the president,\u201d Wisconsin Democratic Senator Tammy Baldwin said on the floor, per the Washington Post.\n\nThe bill, sponsored in the Senate by Alabama Republican Senator Tommy Tuberville, sought to ban trans girls and women from competing in women\u2019s sports at public K-12 schools and universities by amending Title IX, the federal civil rights law that prohibits sex discrimination in educational institutions. If signed into law, the bill would have changed the statute of Title IX to explicitly exclude transgender people from a federal civil rights law. The bill narrowly and falsely defines sex as \u201cbased solely on a person\u2019s reproductive biology and genetics at birth.\u201d\n\nConversely, the Biden administration\u2019s Title IX regulations allowed LGBTQ+ students to fight discrimination without a lawsuit. Instead, they could file a complaint with the Education Department\u2019s Office of Civil Rights.\n\nThe legislation also would have codified into law Donald Trump\u2019s February executive order derisively titled \u201cKeeping Men Out of Women\u2019s Sports,\u201d which directed federal agencies to withdraw funding from educational programs that allow trans girls to play on teams that align with their gender. Although the executive order doesn\u2019t have the power to immediately ban trans women and girls from sports across the country, the Trump administration has already attempted to use it to intimidate states into bending to the administration\u2019s will. Last week, for instance, the president threatened to cut Maine\u2019s federal funding if state governor Janet Mills did not comply with the order.\n\nAnti-trans fearmongering was a major talking point for Republicans during the 2024 election cycle, particularly when it came to demonizing trans women\u2019s inclusion in sports. An October New York Times analysis of AdImpact data found that Republicans had spent over $65 million on anti-trans campaign ads since the beginning of August and the Trump campaign had spent $15.5 million on anti-trans ads in just three weeks.\n\nDemocrats have come under criticism in recent months, including from this publication, for their responses to right-wing anti-trans attacks. During the last election cycle, for instance, Democratic candidates like Texas Rep. Colin Allred and Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown faced pushback after responding to Republican anti-trans attack ads with anti-trans talking points of their own. Shortly after Trump\u2019s presidential victory in November, Democratic New York Rep. Tom Suozzi told the New York Times that the party must \u201cstop pandering to the far left\u201d on trans rights, sparking outrage from LGBTQ+ advocates. And even as South Carolina Republican Rep. Nancy Mace spent the beginning of 2025 hurling anti-trans slurs at Delaware Rep. Sarah McBride, the first out trans woman to serve in Congress, Democrats have largely remained silent. Suffice it to say, holding the line against Republicans\u2019 latest anti-trans attacks is a nice change of pace.\n\nIris Turmelle, one of the plaintiffs now in high school, told Them in a statement last August that her goal is simply to compete alongside her peers.\n\u201cA whole host of overpaid consultants and talking heads told [Democrats] not to do the right thing, and they still chose to do the right thing, so I\u2019d even go a step further and encourage people to contact Senators who opposed this measure (SB 9) and thank them for standing by trans people and our families,\u201d ACLU communications strategist Gillian Branstetter wrote in a March 3 Bluesky post.\n\nAs many experts and trans athletes have pointed out, athletic ability among trans people varies as much as it does for cis people.
