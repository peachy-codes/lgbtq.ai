Reyes \u2014 nominated to her post by former President Biden \u2014 issued a preliminary injunction to block the Trump administration from banning transgender troops from serving in the U.S. military. \ufffc\n\nU.S. District Judge Ana Reyes, who in the past worked to defeat California Proposition 209, which wanted to ban state governmental institutions from considering race, sex, or ethnicity regarding employment, claimed in her 79-page opinion that military leaders were \u201cresponsible for integrating transgender persons into open military service,\u201d and asserted that recruiting, unit cohesion, and military readiness had improved since 2021.\n\nOn January 27, President Trump issued Executive Order 14183, which revoked Biden\u2019s Executive Order 14004, which permitted transgenders to serve openly in the military. Trump\u2019s order stated:\n\n\u2026 the Armed Forces have been afflicted with radical gender ideology to appease activists unconcerned with the requirements of military service like physical and mental health, selflessness, and unit cohesion. Longstanding Department of Defense (DoD) policy (DoD Instruction (DoDI) 6130.03) provides that it is the policy of the DoD to ensure that service members are \u201c[f]ree of medical conditions or physical defects that may reasonably be expected to require excessive time lost from duty for necessary treatment or hospitalization.\u201d\n\n\u201cConsistent with the military mission and longstanding DoD policy, expressing a false \u2018gender identity\u2019 divergent from an individual\u2019s sex cannot satisfy the rigorous standards necessary for military service,\u201d the order continued. \u201cBeyond the hormonal and surgical medical interventions involved, adoption of a gender identity inconsistent with an individual\u2019s sex conflicts with a soldier\u2019s commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one\u2019s personal life. A man\u2019s assertion that he is a woman, and his requirement that others honor this falsehood, is not consistent with the humility and selflessness required of a service member.\u201d \ufffc\n\nOn February 26, Defense Secretary Hegseth issued a memo whose policy stated, \u201cMilitary service by service members and applicants for military service who have a current diagnosis or history of, or exhibit symptoms consistent with, gender dysphoria is incompatible with military service.\u201d \ufffc\n\nReyes claimed the Trump administration \u201crushed\u201d their policy into action, comparing it to previous policies that allowed transgenders into the military. \u201cThe law does not demand that the Court rubber-stamp illogical judgments based on conjecture,\u201d she argued. \ufffc\n\nShe also accused the transgender ban of having \u201canimus.\u201d Reyes wrote, \u201cThe Court could stop here in its analysis and comfortably conclude that plaintiffs are likely to succeed on their claim that the Military Ban is motivated by animus and is not tailored to meet its stated goals.\u201d",
