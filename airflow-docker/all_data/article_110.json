Here are the facts:\n\nRecords show January Littlejohn of Tallahassee, Florida, worked with the school district to support her nonbinary child, before Littlejohn sued the district with lawyers from a national anti-LGBTQ group.\nPayton McNabb, a former high school volleyball player injured during a match with a transgender player, is a paid spokesperson for an anti-transgender group that also advocates to ban health care and to force schools to dangerously out LGBTQ youth without their consent.\n\u201cBiological man\u201d is not a term used by the medical community, but is used by opponents of trans people to fearmonger and spread disinformation. Scientific research shows human biology is complex and that sex and gender diversity has existed throughout history and cultures.\nAdditional background:\n\nPayton McNabb played high school volleyball in North Carolina, where she suffered a traumatic brain injury after being hit in the head with a volleyball during a match with a transgender player in 2022. McNabb has since been hired by opponents of transgender people to use her injury to argue that all trans youth should be denied the chance to play sports as their authentic selves.\n\nMcNabb works with a group that aggressively lobbies against transgender people, the so-called Independent Women\u2019s Forum.\nIWF activates against transgender people under the guise of \u201cprotecting women,\u201d yet its actions do nothing to protect women:\nPushing bans on essential health care for transgender people\nSupporting the harmful practice of outing LGBTQ students without their consent, without consideration of the risks to doing so to unsupportive parents. Up to 40% of all homeless youth are LGBTQ.\nUrging the dangerous and illegal relocation of detainees to facilities that do not match their gender identity, action that has been blocked by multiple federal courts as cruel and unusual punishment and a violation of the U.S. Constitution.\nIgnoring research that shows states that include transgender students in sports actually have more girls playing than states with bans.\nMcNabb is among more than 200,000 high school and college female volleyball players who have reported injuries including head trauma since 2012. The vast majority of these injuries and accidents involve cisgender competitors and teammates. No one is calling for cisgender athletes involved in accidents to be banned from sports.\nThere has been no legislation proposed at the federal level by anti-trans activists that addresses actual problems of safety and equity for women and girls\u2019 sports, including regulations to protect athletes from abusive coaches and fans, ensure equal facilities and marketing, or ways to expand access to health care and recovery, for all players including people like McNabb.\nIndependent Women\u2019s Forum\u2019s legal director, May Mailman, recently transitioned to serve as White House legal counsel. Mailman has promoted the White House\u2019s unprecedented campaign against transgender people.
