  "content": "Each year on March 31, the world observes Transgender Day of Visibility (TDOV) to celebrate the lives and contributions of trans people, while also drawing attention to the disproportionate levels of poverty, discrimination, and violence the community faces compared to cisgender (non-transgender) people.\n\nInternational TDOV was created in 2010 by trans advocate Rachel Crandall. Crandall, the head of Transgender Michigan, created TDOV in response to the overwhelming majority of media stories about transgender people being focused on violence. She hoped to create a day where people could celebrate the lives of transgender people, while simultaneously acknowledging that due to discrimination, not every trans person can or wants to be visible.\n\nFor many transgender people, it feels as if we are living in unprecedented times. In just the first three months of 2025, a staggering 821 anti-trans bills have been introduced in state legislatures across the country. Furthermore, the current administration has targeted trans people through executive orders limiting trans people\u2019s ability to obtain passports that accurately reflect our gender, attempted to reinstate a blanket ban on trans people serving in the military, and a number of other orders of varying enforceability aimed at erasing trans people from public life.\n\nPart of the fear-mongering around trans people is predicated on the idea that being a trans person is a new fad or phase, when the reality is that trans people have existed as long as people have existed. So for this Trans Day of Visibility, we are spotlighting six incredible trans community elders, sharing their messages of resilience for these difficult times, and offer words of hope.\n\nSharing their thoughts with us are acclaimed actress and singer, Sandra Caldwell; citizen of the Oneida Nation and Anishinaabe Tribe, and Indigiqueer/two-spirit Nation, Grammy-winning musician and storyteller, Ty Defoe; President and CEO of the Trans Latin@ Coalition, Bamby Salcedo; Executive Director of Advocates For Trans Equality (A4TE), Rodrigo Heng-Lehtinen; celebrated academic theorist, researcher, and founder of the Advanced Communication Technology Laboratory, Allucqu\u00e9re Rosanne \u201cSandy\u201d Stone; and Houstonian and Executive Director of Transgender Education Network of Texas, Emmett Schelling. (Full bios can be found at the bottom of the article)\n\n(Please note, interview responses have been lightly edited for clarity and length)\n\n\u201cI have found\nmusic to release\ndancing to sweat\nrelatives in community\nand delicious food\nto nourish my soul.\nIn these practices,\nI am alive and resilient.\u201d\n\n \u2013 Ty Defoe\n\nResilience and community, both past and present, were the major themes of our conversations with these trans people who transitioned many years ago. One common theme running through their answers was that community didn\u2019t exist back in the mid-20th century in the way it does today.\n\nSandra Caldwell, who transitioned in the 1970s, said, \u201cWe weren\u2019t allowed so much to be in community. I have to be honest about this, because I wasn\u2019t in community. Community was separated back then\u2026 the Black queer community, the Black gay community, Black trans community, hadn\u2019t found themselves yet. So we joined in with other communities and learned, learned from what we could get.\u201d She continued, \u201cThe key words were, keep your head down, keep your mouth shut, and keep it moving\u2026 that kept you alive\u2026 I was stealth for a good 35 to 40 years\u2026 That allowed me to work, that allowed me to get an [acting] career going, that allowed me everything\u2026 but I was always nervous waiting for the other shoe to drop\u2026 It was the silliest thing to think about\u2026 I was worried about [getting fired due to] silly things like morals clauses in show-biz contracts, not was I doing a good job.\u201d\n\nSandy Stone, who transitioned in the 1960s, echoed these sentiments, stating, \u201cI didn\u2019t have the luxury of trans support networks during transition. Consequently, I had no reference for the accompanying physical, emotional, and chemical turmoil.\u201d\n\nShe went on to explain a brief flash of community that she did experience early on, which changed everything. \u201cDuring the worst of it, when I was fried, exhausted, and desperate, I encountered a trans woman who took one look at me and invited me to her home, where she offered me a meal and asked me to listen to some recorded music. It was Cris Williamson\u2019s \u2018Changer and the Changed\u2019, and it changed my life. It was a gateway to a community, not physically present but real in both immediate and potential ways. It taught me that even being able to say, \u2018They\u2019re out there,\u2019 can sustain you for a long time.\u201d\n\nWhere we come from and where we\u2019ve gotten to now is something many of our interviewees took a lot of strength from. Rodrigo Heng-Lehtinen stated, \u201cI draw a lot of inspiration from history. Right now, it\u2019s easy to get disheartened because we\u2019re being targeted and attacked by those in power. It\u2019s the backlash to all the progress we made these last 20 years. But we\u2019ve been here before. The history of the LGBTQ movement, and really all social justice movements in the US, is cycles of progress and backlash and progress again. It\u2019s cyclical. That doesn\u2019t make it easy, it still hurts. But hurting is not the same as giving up. We\u2019ve made it through before. We will make it through again. That\u2019s not naivet\u00e9, it\u2019s history.\u201d\n\nThe contrast between where we were 60 years ago to now became a main area of discussion; especially the ways in which community is a source of strength for us that we may not have had in the past to weather hostile storms.\n\nIn speaking about her own experiences, Bamby Salcedo added, \u201cWhen I first, you know, got out of rehab, and I was early [in my transition] and entering into social justice work, I remember members of our community, particularly trans women who were leaders and skilled leaders at that time\u2026 they would tell me affirming words\u2026 Like you are a strong person, you\u2019re going to do great things, and you are a leader in our community.\u201d She went on, \u201cI obviously didn\u2019t understand at the time\u2026 but just hearing those words of encouragement and really thinking that I was someone was definitely uplifting. [It] supported me to eventually believe that I could do great things. And now I have been a manifestation of that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have the privilege to be the president and the CEO of the Trans Latin@ Coalition. And my definition of a CEO is \u2018Community Elevated Officer\u2019, because I believe that it has been the community who has uplifted me and supported me to be the person that I am today\u2026 And so to me, community is integral to my work and into my existence.\u201d\n\nThe importance of community uplift was echoed by Emmett Schelling, \u201cI\u2019ve had to go through a lot as a trans man, single parent, immigrant, and Texan. In spite of all the systemic barriers and people that told me I wasn\u2019t worthy, I have built the life every trans person deserves. I am living the life I wanted for myself as a husband, a father, and a Houstonian. I could have never done this without the support, friendship, and camaraderie I found in the trans Texan community, the community at large, and through the friends and chosen family I\u2019ve made across the movement. When times are tough, we know we can lean on each other.\u201d\n\nHe went on to discuss how the community is showing up for trans Texans today, saying \u201cWe\u2019ve seen an uptick in trans-specific attacks coming from state leadership in Texas. This fight has been tough, and is exhausting at times for trans Texans. We\u2019ve seen an outpouring of support from allies in Texas, and across the world\u2026 We\u2019ve seen practical support from our friends across state lines and an outpouring of support from people across the globe through our Love Letters to Trans Texans campaign.\u201d\n\nAnd as Sandra pointed out, community isn\u2019t a one way street in which elders give without getting in return, explaining, \u201cI really couldn\u2019t believe [the trans tipping point moment] when it first happened. I could not believe what was going on, because I never thought it would happen that our young trans women, our young queer gay folk, would go in this deep. I watched everyone. I took a little bit from everybody. I really did. A couple of my new, new dear friends, held my hand and pulled me along. I call them the kids.\u201d\n\nBut that resilience doesn\u2019t only come from community, it also comes from within. When Sandy talked about how she finds that resilience inside herself, she said, \u201cBy remembering times I watched some brave, forthright person beat the odds. Or by remembering times when I beat the odds. There\u2019s nothing quite as satisfying as saying \u2018I\u2019m still here.\u2019\u201d\n\nSandra also spoke of building on the strength of not only trans people, but also the Black community, saying, \u201cAs a Black woman, I live by the rules of my family, my mom, my sisters, there\u2019s a way of living as a Black woman that is like no other. You can\u2019t reproduce it. It is what it is, the language is what it is, the lessons are what they are at being a Black woman, and that\u2019s where I live. And I live from my humanness, from my family\u2026 That\u2019s the lessons I bring to the community, to our community\u2026 I bring information from six decades of black women\u2026 six decades of black queer folk. I bring that information.\u201d\n\nWhen musing on the word \u201cresilience\u201d, Bamby added, \u201cWell, I mean, it was completely honest for me, like I didn\u2019t even know that word existed, right? \u2026 The fact that I have been able to overcome many different and horrific experiences right throughout my life\u2026 violence in many different forms\u2026 It has been my resilience that has allowed me to survive\u2026 But also I have had the opportunity to turn those horrific experiences into opportunities, not just for me, but also for members of my community.\u201d\n\nAnd she tied it all back, saying, \u201cI would say, part of my resilience is also being able to pay it forward, right? Because, again, if we think of this full circle moment\u2026 I was supported by other trans people. And now I\u2019m able to do work in community, for my community.\n\nBut this moment isn\u2019t just about self-reliance, resilience, or trying to foster community. It\u2019s also about trying to foster hope in an increasingly hostile environment.\n\nWhen speaking about keeping the flame of hope alive, Sandy said, \u201cThere are two rules to this game: 1) Nothing is as bad as it looks. 2) Nothing is as good as it looks. Each time you figure out how  to deal with an obstacle, each time you encounter a challenge and come out the other side, possibly bruised and abused but still alive, you become a little smarter and a little stronger\u2026 This is going to be a  rough time, but we\u2019ll surmount it the same way we surmounted the horrors of the recent past. We learned. We changed the terms of engagement. And we\u2019re still here\u2026and we\u2019re tougher. Sometimes, when everything looks hopeless, when all we have is just the instinct to show  up\u2026then just show up. Just show up. Trust that. After a while, in spite of weariness or  numbness or despair, the next step appears, and then the next. And then you begin to truly understand who you are and what your gift is and why you\u2019re here.\u201d\n\nAnd when thinking about the concept of hope, Bamby reminded us that hope isn\u2019t only an emotion, it can also be an action, saying, \u201cMany members of our community do live in hope, right? Because hope is what, in my opinion, carries me to a better place\u2026 Understand that again, there are many members of our community who are doing amazing work, who are organizing, are strategizing, are mobilizing people to understand that we can create a better world and we can create a better future for us, and that\u2019s certainly what we as an organization are doing\u2026 And you know, the Trans Latin@ Coalition is an organization that will continue to foster leaders, and we\u2019ll have resources to continue to support our community\u2026 despite the oppression that we continue to experience, so there will be a better future for all of us. It\u2019s just a matter of us making sure that we work together to create that.\u201d\n\nAnd when speaking about what his message would be for trans youth and those who may be older but just starting their journey, Ty reminded us, \u201cWhile short-term struggles are real, having a vision for the future can help sustain motivation. This includes imagining a world where trans people are fully accepted, have equal rights, and live without fear. Encouraging others to visualize this future can build a collective sense of purpose.\u201d He went on, talking about taking small steps but having big dreams, saying \u201cIt\u2019s important to acknowledge that the journey to change is ongoing. Small actions, like advocating for inclusive policies at the local level, organizing support groups, or simply being kind to one another, can add up to create lasting change.\u201d\n\nRodrigo echoed this message, encouraging people, \u201cGet involved. Don\u2019t get caught in the cycle of either doomscrolling the news or tuning out. Both paths are passive, and both leave you disempowered. Put yourself in the driver\u2019s seat. Call your elected officials, vote in the local races everyone else ignores, run for local office yourself. Start a trans book club, mentor a trans youth, volunteer at your LGBTQ community center\u2026 History is made by those of us who take the initiative to make it happen. You can start right now.\u201d\n\nEmmett added a reminder that while the moment may seem scary, \u201cPlease remember there are thousands of people in Texas fighting for your futures, and your present. Our community has fought for decades for our right to survive and thrive, and we will continue to get through this and persevere. Our existence has always been challenged, but the transcestors whose shoulders we stand upon ensured that we made the progress we have \u2013 with far less resources.\u201d\n\nAnd Rodrigo offered a reminder that it\u2019s okay to take a pause, saying, \u201cYou have more time than you think. When you\u2019re young, everything feels like a big deal. As you age, you gain perspective. The same is true for your \u2018trans age\u2019, or how long since you started living as your authentic self. It can feel like you need to rush. But I encourage everyone to take a deep breath. I took a long time by many standards, yet I\u2019m thriving. There\u2019s no such thing as being behind. No one is in charge of your transition but you.\u201d\n\nAnd Sandy drew a throughline from past to present, reminding us of the progress that we have already made, saying \u201cMy generation lived through a period in which trans people made huge gains in public acceptance. We may not live to see gains like that again, but the current crop of trans kids almost certainly will. We\u2019ve taken ten steps forward. Now we\u2019re about to be beaten five steps back. But at the end of the day we\u2019re still five steps ahead. That\u2019s how culture works. That\u2019s how progress works\u2026 bit by bit, it adds up. Twenty years ago there were a few lone trans voices. Now there are trans attorneys, trans legislators, trans academics, trans families, trans folks just living their lives. We\u2019re not going back from that.\u201d\n\nShe went on to offer her message as a trans elder, saying, \u201cWe\u2019re here. We made it. Here\u2019s a phone call from the future: we say you\u2019ll survive and thrive and grow to become us, then you\u2019ll surpass us, then you\u2019ll reach back in time and extend a hand to the young ones. Across time, trans folk are shouting encouragement. You\u2019ll make it. And you\u2019ll accomplish things we never even dreamed of.\u201d\n\nSandra harkened back to inner strength, reminding us of the miracle of being here in this moment, saying, \u201cI think you learn, you grow, into the strengths of a trans woman. Trans women have got to be strong, man. If you have survived this long, your behind was strong. I knew plenty of plenty, plenty of women back in the day who didn\u2019t make it. If I have a message to the youngins, it\u2019s: \u2018Youngins \u2013 stand still.\u2019 Pay attention. Make sure the decisions you\u2019re making will be your answers in the future. Make sure what you\u2019re thinking or what you\u2019re deciding right now, they\u2019re going to add to your future. Fun is fun. Party is party. I know, and you all gotta have your fun and party, but please be aware, be aware of the journey of getting to your future.\u201d\n\nAnd Bamby reminded us that this is a generational fight, saying, \u201cI think one of the things that it\u2019s important for all of us to recognize is that we have a society and many institutions within our society that have for centuries tried to erase our existence and really negate opportunities for the integration of our community into the tapestry of our society, right? And so this is nothing new for many of us.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would say it\u2019s important for you to understand that we stand on the shoulders of generations of true fighters\u2026 and that it is important to understand that you, as an individual, hold power\u2026 And also as a community we have power\u2026 Understand that there\u2019s a whole community that is fighting for you.\u201d\n\nAnd much like we started, Ty left us with a beautiful poem dedicated to trans youth:\n\nYou are unfolding,\nlike a flower that hasn\u2019t yet decided\nwhich direction the sun will call it.\n\nDon\u2019t be afraid to explore,\nto stretch your wings in a thousand directions,\neven those the world hasn\u2019t named yet.\n\nThere are paths you haven\u2019t seen,\nroads that haven\u2019t been built,\nbut they will be,\n\nListen closely to yourself,\nthe quiet voice that whispers\nthrough the noise of others\u2019 expectations,\nthe one that knows what you need,\neven when the world is unsure.\n\nReach out to those who know\nthe weight of questions and the beauty of becoming.\nLet their stories mingle with yours,\ncreating a tapestry of connection.\n\nAnd remember,\nthere is no rush to arrive,\nno deadline for who you are meant to be.\nYou are already enough,\njust as you are,\nand always, always,\nyou are becoming.\n\n\u2013 Ty Defoe\n\nAllucqu\u00e9re Rosanne \u201cSandy\u201d Stone is Professor Emerita and Founding Director of the Advanced  Communication Technologies Laboratory (ACTLab) and the Convergent Media program at the  University of Texas at Austin, Wolfgang Kohler Professor of Media and Performance at the  European Graduate School, Fellow of the University of California Humanities Research Institute,  and Banff Centre Senior Artist.

(Full bios can be found at the bottom of the article)\n\n(Please note, interview responses have been lightly edited for clarity and length)\n\n\u201cI have found\nmusic to release\ndancing to sweat\nrelatives in community\nand delicious food\nto nourish my soul.\nIn these practices,\nI am alive and resilient.\u201d\n\n \u2013 Ty Defoe\n\nResilience and community, both past and present, were the major themes of our conversations with these trans people who transitioned many years ago. One common theme running through their answers was that community didn\u2019t exist back in the mid-20th century in the way it does today.\n\nSandra Caldwell, who transitioned in the 1970s, said, \u201cWe weren\u2019t allowed so much to be in community. I have to be honest about this, because I wasn\u2019t in community. Community was separated back then\u2026 the Black queer community, the Black gay community, Black trans community, hadn\u2019t found themselves yet. So we joined in with other communities and learned, learned from what we could get.\u201d She continued, \u201cThe key words were, keep your head down, keep your mouth shut, and keep it moving\u2026 that kept you alive\u2026 I was stealth for a good 35 to 40 years\u2026 That allowed me to work, that allowed me to get an [acting] career going, that allowed me everything\u2026 but I was always nervous waiting for the other shoe to drop\u2026 It was the silliest thing to think about\u2026 I was worried about [getting fired due to] silly things like morals clauses in show-biz contracts, not was I doing a good job.\u201d\n\nSandy Stone, who transitioned in the 1960s, echoed these sentiments, stating, \u201cI didn\u2019t have the luxury of trans support networks during transition. Consequently, I had no reference for the accompanying physical, emotional, and chemical turmoil.\u201d\n\nShe went on to explain a brief flash of community that she did experience early on, which changed everything. \u201cDuring the worst of it, when I was fried, exhausted, and desperate, I encountered a trans woman who took one look at me and invited me to her home, where she offered me a meal and asked me to listen to some recorded music. It was Cris Williamson\u2019s \u2018Changer and the Changed\u2019, and it changed my life. It was a gateway to a community, not physically present but real in both immediate and potential ways. It taught me that even being able to say, \u2018They\u2019re out there,\u2019 can sustain you for a long time.\u201d\n\nWhere we come from and where we\u2019ve gotten to now is something many of our interviewees took a lot of strength from. Rodrigo Heng-Lehtinen stated, \u201cI draw a lot of inspiration from history. Right now, it\u2019s easy to get disheartened because we\u2019re being targeted and attacked by those in power. It\u2019s the backlash to all the progress we made these last 20 years. But we\u2019ve been here before. The history of the LGBTQ movement, and really all social justice movements in the US, is cycles of progress and backlash and progress again. It\u2019s cyclical. That doesn\u2019t make it easy, it still hurts. But hurting is not the same as giving up. We\u2019ve made it through before. We will make it through again. That\u2019s not naivet\u00e9, it\u2019s history.\u201d\n\nThe contrast between where we were 60 years ago to now became a main area of discussion; especially the ways in which community is a source of strength for us that we may not have had in the past to weather hostile storms.\n\nIn speaking about her own experiences, Bamby Salcedo added, \u201cWhen I first, you know, got out of rehab, and I was early [in my transition] and entering into social justice work, I remember members of our community, particularly trans women who were leaders and skilled leaders at that time\u2026 they would tell me affirming words\u2026 Like you are a strong person, you\u2019re going to do great things, and you are a leader in our community.\u201d She went on, \u201cI obviously didn\u2019t understand at the time\u2026 but just hearing those words of encouragement and really thinking that I was someone was definitely uplifting. [It] supported me to eventually believe that I could do great things. And now I have been a manifestation of that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have the privilege to be the president and the CEO of the Trans Latin@ Coalition. And my definition of a CEO is \u2018Community Elevated Officer\u2019, because I believe that it has been the community who has uplifted me and supported me to be the person that I am today\u2026 And so to me, community is integral to my work and into my existence.\u201d\n\nThe importance of community uplift was echoed by Emmett Schelling, \u201cI\u2019ve had to go through a lot as a trans man, single parent, immigrant, and Texan. In spite of all the systemic barriers and people that told me I wasn\u2019t worthy, I have built the life every trans person deserves. I am living the life I wanted for myself as a husband, a father, and a Houstonian. I could have never done this without the support, friendship, and camaraderie I found in the trans Texan community, the community at large, and through the friends and chosen family I\u2019ve made across the movement. When times are tough, we know we can lean on each other.\u201d\n\nHe went on to discuss how the community is showing up for trans Texans today, saying \u201cWe\u2019ve seen an uptick in trans-specific attacks coming from state leadership in Texas. This fight has been tough, and is exhausting at times for trans Texans. We\u2019ve seen an outpouring of support from allies in Texas, and across the world\u2026 We\u2019ve seen practical support from our friends across state lines and an outpouring of support from people across the globe through our Love Letters to Trans Texans campaign.\u201d\n\nAnd as Sandra pointed out, community isn\u2019t a one way street in which elders give without getting in return, explaining, \u201cI really couldn\u2019t believe [the trans tipping point moment] when it first happened. I could not believe what was going on, because I never thought it would happen that our young trans women, our young queer gay folk, would go in this deep. I watched everyone. I took a little bit from everybody. I really did. A couple of my new, new dear friends, held my hand and pulled me along. I call them the kids.\u201d\n\nBut that resilience doesn\u2019t only come from community, it also comes from within. When Sandy talked about how she finds that resilience inside herself, she said, \u201cBy remembering times I watched some brave, forthright person beat the odds. Or by remembering times when I beat the odds. There\u2019s nothing quite as satisfying as saying \u2018I\u2019m still here.\u2019\u201d\n\nSandra also spoke of building on the strength of not only trans people, but also the Black community, saying, \u201cAs a Black woman, I live by the rules of my family, my mom, my sisters, there\u2019s a way of living as a Black woman that is like no other. You can\u2019t reproduce it. It is what it is, the language is what it is, the lessons are what they are at being a Black woman, and that\u2019s where I live. And I live from my humanness, from my family\u2026 That\u2019s the lessons I bring to the community, to our community\u2026 I bring information from six decades of black women\u2026 six decades of black queer folk. I bring that information.\u201d\n\nWhen musing on the word \u201cresilience\u201d, Bamby added, \u201cWell, I mean, it was completely honest for me, like I didn\u2019t even know that word existed, right? \u2026 The fact that I have been able to overcome many different and horrific experiences right throughout my life\u2026 violence in many different forms\u2026 It has been my resilience that has allowed me to survive\u2026 But also I have had the opportunity to turn those horrific experiences into opportunities, not just for me, but also for members of my community.\u201d\n\nAnd she tied it all back, saying, \u201cI would say, part of my resilience is also being able to pay it forward, right? Because, again, if we think of this full circle moment\u2026 I was supported by other trans people. And now I\u2019m able to do work in community, for my community.\n\nBut this moment isn\u2019t just about self-reliance, resilience, or trying to foster community. It\u2019s also about trying to foster hope in an increasingly hostile environment.\n\nWhen speaking about keeping the flame of hope alive, Sandy said, \u201cThere are two rules to this game: 1) Nothing is as bad as it looks. 2) Nothing is as good as it looks. Each time you figure out how  to deal with an obstacle, each time you encounter a challenge and come out the other side, possibly bruised and abused but still alive, you become a little smarter and a little stronger\u2026 This is going to be a  rough time, but we\u2019ll surmount it the same way we surmounted the horrors of the recent past. We learned. We changed the terms of engagement. And we\u2019re still here\u2026and we\u2019re tougher. Sometimes, when everything looks hopeless, when all we have is just the instinct to show  up\u2026then just show up. Just show up. Trust that. After a while, in spite of weariness or  numbness or despair, the next step appears, and then the next. And then you begin to truly understand who you are and what your gift is and why you\u2019re here.\u201d\n\nAnd when thinking about the concept of hope, Bamby reminded us that hope isn\u2019t only an emotion, it can also be an action, saying, \u201cMany members of our community do live in hope, right? Because hope is what, in my opinion, carries me to a better place\u2026 Understand that again, there are many members of our community who are doing amazing work, who are organizing, are strategizing, are mobilizing people to understand that we can create a better world and we can create a better future for us, and that\u2019s certainly what we as an organization are doing\u2026 And you know, the Trans Latin@ Coalition is an organization that will continue to foster leaders, and we\u2019ll have resources to continue to support our community\u2026 despite the oppression that we continue to experience, so there will be a better future for all of us. It\u2019s just a matter of us making sure that we work together to create that.\u201d\n\nAnd when speaking about what his message would be for trans youth and those who may be older but just starting their journey, Ty reminded us, \u201cWhile short-term struggles are real, having a vision for the future can help sustain motivation. This includes imagining a world where trans people are fully accepted, have equal rights, and live without fear. Encouraging others to visualize this future can build a collective sense of purpose.\u201d He went on, talking about taking small steps but having big dreams, saying \u201cIt\u2019s important to acknowledge that the journey to change is ongoing. Small actions, like advocating for inclusive policies at the local level, organizing support groups, or simply being kind to one another, can add up to create lasting change.\u201d\n\nRodrigo echoed this message, encouraging people, \u201cGet involved. Don\u2019t get caught in the cycle of either doomscrolling the news or tuning out. Both paths are passive, and both leave you disempowered. Put yourself in the driver\u2019s seat. Call your elected officials, vote in the local races everyone else ignores, run for local office yourself. Start a trans book club, mentor a trans youth, volunteer at your LGBTQ community center\u2026 History is made by those of us who take the initiative to make it happen. You can start right now.\u201d\n\nEmmett added a reminder that while the moment may seem scary, \u201cPlease remember there are thousands of people in Texas fighting for your futures, and your present. Our community has fought for decades for our right to survive and thrive, and we will continue to get through this and persevere. Our existence has always been challenged, but the transcestors whose shoulders we stand upon ensured that we made the progress we have \u2013 with far less resources.\u201d\n\nAnd Rodrigo offered a reminder that it\u2019s okay to take a pause, saying, \u201cYou have more time than you think. When you\u2019re young, everything feels like a big deal. As you age, you gain perspective. The same is true for your \u2018trans age\u2019, or how long since you started living as your authentic self. It can feel like you need to rush. But I encourage everyone to take a deep breath. I took a long time by many standards, yet I\u2019m thriving. There\u2019s no such thing as being behind. No one is in charge of your transition but you.\u201d\n\nAnd Sandy drew a throughline from past to present, reminding us of the progress that we have already made, saying \u201cMy generation lived through a period in which trans people made huge gains in public acceptance. We may not live to see gains like that again, but the current crop of trans kids almost certainly will. We\u2019ve taken ten steps forward. Now we\u2019re about to be beaten five steps back. But at the end of the day we\u2019re still five steps ahead. That\u2019s how culture works. That\u2019s how progress works\u2026 bit by bit, it adds up. Twenty years ago there were a few lone trans voices. Now there are trans attorneys, trans legislators, trans academics, trans families, trans folks just living their lives. We\u2019re not going back from that.\u201d\n\nShe went on to offer her message as a trans elder, saying, \u201cWe\u2019re here. We made it. Here\u2019s a phone call from the future: we say you\u2019ll survive and thrive and grow to become us, then you\u2019ll surpass us, then you\u2019ll reach back in time and extend a hand to the young ones. Across time, trans folk are shouting encouragement. You\u2019ll make it. And you\u2019ll accomplish things we never even dreamed of.\u201d\n\nSandra harkened back to inner strength, reminding us of the miracle of being here in this moment, saying, \u201cI think you learn, you grow, into the strengths of a trans woman. Trans women have got to be strong, man. If you have survived this long, your behind was strong. I knew plenty of plenty, plenty of women back in the day who didn\u2019t make it. If I have a message to the youngins, it\u2019s: \u2018Youngins \u2013 stand still.\u2019 Pay attention. Make sure the decisions you\u2019re making will be your answers in the future. Make sure what you\u2019re thinking or what you\u2019re deciding right now, they\u2019re going to add to your future. Fun is fun. Party is party. I know, and you all gotta have your fun and party, but please be aware, be aware of the journey of getting to your future.\u201d\n\nAnd Bamby reminded us that this is a generational fight, saying, \u201cI think one of the things that it\u2019s important for all of us to recognize is that we have a society and many institutions within our society that have for centuries tried to erase our existence and really negate opportunities for the integration of our community into the tapestry of our society, right? And so this is nothing new for many of us.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would say it\u2019s important for you to understand that we stand on the shoulders of generations of true fighters\u2026 and that it is important to understand that you, as an individual, hold power\u2026 And also as a community we have power\u2026 Understand that there\u2019s a whole community that is fighting for you.\u201d\n\nAnd much like we started, Ty left us with a beautiful poem dedicated to trans youth:\n\nYou are unfolding,\nlike a flower that hasn\u2019t yet decided\nwhich direction the sun will call it.\n\nDon\u2019t be afraid to explore,\nto stretch your wings in a thousand directions,\neven those the world hasn\u2019t named yet.\n\nThere are paths you haven\u2019t seen,\nroads that haven\u2019t been built,\nbut they will be,\n\nListen closely to yourself,\nthe quiet voice that whispers\nthrough the noise of others\u2019 expectations,\nthe one that knows what you need,\neven when the world is unsure.\n\nReach out to those who know\nthe weight of questions and the beauty of becoming.\nLet their stories mingle with yours,\ncreating a tapestry of connection.\n\nAnd remember,\nthere is no rush to arrive,\nno deadline for who you are meant to be.\nYou are already enough,\njust as you are,\nand always, always,\nyou are becoming.\n\n\u2013 Ty Defoe\n\nAllucqu\u00e9re Rosanne \u201cSandy\u201d Stone is Professor Emerita and Founding Director of the Advanced  Communication Technologies Laboratory (ACTLab) and the Convergent Media program at the  University of Texas at Austin, Wolfgang Kohler Professor of Media and Performance at the  European Graduate School, Fellow of the University of California Humanities Research Institute,  and Banff Centre Senior Artist.
