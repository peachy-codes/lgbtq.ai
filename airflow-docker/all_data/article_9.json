Skrmetti, the Biden Justice Department and the ACLU argued that the state law violates the equal protection clause of the Constitution\u2019s 14th Amendment because it discriminates based on sex. To the contrary, the state of Tennessee and its attorney general, Jonathan Skrmetti, say the law restricts conduct based only on age (for those children under the age of 18) and how certain drugs are used (for so-called gender-affirming care). Legal challenges to these types of laws are typically brought by parents who seek drugs, such as puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones, and surgical intervention for their children who profess to identify with the opposite sex. They argue that laws like Tennessee\u2019s violate two parts of the 14th Amendment\u2014the due process clause, by depriving parents of the right to make medical decisions for their children, and the equal protection clause, by discriminating against their children based on sex.\n\nPresident Joe Biden\u2019s administration, rather than parents, brought this challenge, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit rejected both arguments. Last year, the 8th Circuit struck down a similar Arkansas law, but only on equal protection grounds.\nThe Supreme Court, therefore, is addressing only that argument, because that is the one on which the 6th and 8th circuits disagreed. During the argument, however, Justice Amy Coney Barrett clarified that upholding the Tennessee statute on equal protection grounds would not prevent parents from pursuing their claim that such laws violate the due process clause.\n\n\u2018Main Issue on the Table\u2019\nThe heart of the challengers\u2019 case is that the Tennessee statute treats people differently based on sex. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson agreed that this is the \u201cmain issue on the table.\u201d The kind of classification of a law is important to determining the appropriate standard of review, which in turn determines how easy or difficult it is to defend that law against a challenge under the equal protection clause.\n\nMost laws that make distinctions as to when they will or will not apply do not do so on the basis of a \u201csuspect class.\u201d Such laws are subject to rational basis review and are constitutional if they are a \u201crational\u201d way of addressing a \u201clegitimate\u201d legislative purpose\u2014a relatively easy standard to meet.\n\nIf a law makes distinctions by classifying people based on a \u201csex,\u201d it is subject to heightened or \u201cintermediate scrutiny\u201d review. Such laws will be upheld only if they are \u201csubstantially related\u201d to achieving an \u201cimportant\u201d government purpose.\n\nAs Tennessee persuasively argues, rather than classifying based on sex, the law classifies on based on purpose. In other words, it distinguishes based on minors seeking drugs for gender transition and minors seeking drugs for any other medical purposes. The Supreme Court has never recognized restrictions on the use of drugs for a particular medical purpose to demand heightened scrutiny review, so rational-basis review applies.\n\nThat standard, the state of Tennessee easily satisfies, and the 6th Circuit agreed. \u2018A Sex-Based Classification\u2019?\nBut the challengers want to label the law a sex-based classification to make it harder for Tennessee to defend.\n\nArguing for the Biden administration, U.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar asked the court simply to put the Tennessee statute in that category and send the case back to the lower courts to apply the \u201cintermediate scrutiny\u201d review test. But Justice Brett Kavanaugh observed that, if it did, the case would soon be right back in the Supreme Court\u2019s lap.\n\nPrelogar insisted that the Tennessee statute is obviously based on sex, but her argument is inconsistent with the text of the statute itself. She argued that the law would allow a boy to obtain puberty-blockers to delay experiencing a normal male puberty, but a girl could not. But the statute only says that a minor may not obtain such drugs for the purposes of identifying with a different sex\u2014and that prohibition applies equally to both boys and to girls.\n\nDespite Prelogar\u2019s insistence, the law only restricts access to the drugs based on age and on the medical use of the drugs.\n\nKavanaugh, Chief Justice John Roberts, and Justice Samuel Alito expressed hesitancy about involving themselves in issues that are better left to state legislatures to decide.\n\n\u2018Leave the Issue to the Legislatures\u2019?\nRoberts argued that the court was \u201cnot [in] the best situation to make determinations about medical considerations. Doesn\u2019t that make the case for us to leave the issue to the legislatures?\u201d He also alluded to the court\u2019s landmark ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization in June 2022, which overturned Roe v. Wade, saying that the current case was really about \u201cconstitutional allocations of authority.\u201d In an almost verbatim recitation from the Dobbs majority opinion, he continued: \u201cPerhaps we should leave this issue to the people and their elected representatives.\u201d\n\nRoberts and Kavanaugh also stressed the shaky scientific footing of gender \u201cmedicine,\u201d and cited various European reports, saying that \u201ccountries who have been at the forefront [are now] pumping the brakes on this,\u201d something that Kavanaugh noted gave the court \u201ca yellow light, if not a red light\u201d in moving forward into \u201cconstitutionalizing\u201d a new area of law.\n\nBut it was perhaps the line of questioning from Alito that was the most intense of the morning. Alito, too, cited specific studies from Sweden and England, including the bombshell Cass report, which indicated that gender medicine is largely unproven and presents significant health risks to children.\n\nHe chided Prelogar, saying that she had \u201crelegated [it] to a footnote.\u201d\n\nIn their briefs, both the government and the ACLU asserted a different basis on which the court could provide relief.\n\nIf the justices didn\u2019t think the law discriminated based on sex, they could find that the law discriminated on the basis of transgender status, and that, too, they argued, would require that the law be subject to intermediate scrutiny review. This alternative argument also took center stage in Wednesday\u2019s argument. A majority of the justices, however, did not seem to buy it.\n\nBoth Barrett and Alito pointed out that the court had turned down other requests to expand constitutionally protected categories, such as age and mental disability. Their line of demarcation in equal protection clause cases had always been immutable characteristics\u2014those derived by accident of birth, such as race, sex, and national origin.\n\nSo, when transgender lawyer Chase Strangio took the podium for the ACLU, Alito continued his grilling, asking pointedly \u201cIs transgender status immutable?\u201d When Strangio responded that it would indeed \u201csatisfy an immutability test,\u201d Alito peppered the ACLU lawyer with various hypotheticals: What about people who are \u201cgender-fluid,\u201d or who change gender identities over time, or who are \u201cnonbinary\u201d?\n\n\u2018An Immutable Characteristic\u2019?\nWhen Strangio floundered, Alito retorted, \u201cSo, transgender status is not an immutable characteristic, is it?\u201d\n\nUnsurprisingly, the more liberal members of the court, Jackson and Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, appeared more favorable to Prelogar\u2019s and Strangio\u2019s arguments. Jackson likened the current case to Loving v. Virginia, the court\u2019s landmark civil rights decision that determined that laws banning interracial marriage violated the Equal Protection and Due Process clauses of the 14th Amendment.\n\nIn arguing that the state had once legislated in such a way based on racial classifications, and that the court had overridden those state legislative judgments based on the Constitution\u2019s promise of equality, Jackson argued it should do the same here.  Twenty-six states have passed laws similar to Tennessee\u2019s in the past few years, and some of them have been challenged in the courts. But U.S. v. Skrmetti is the first case of its kind to reach the Supreme Court.\n\nThe court\u2019s decision, which likely won\u2019t be issued till June, no doubt will have a significant impact on the legislative and litigation efforts on this controversial issue for years to come.\n",
