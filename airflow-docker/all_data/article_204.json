I thank Senator Skinner for advancing this important legislation that puts children\u2019s well-being first.\u201d \n\nWhile Newsom\u2019s backing of the bill made headlines, the Democrat majority has refused to consider numerous other child protection proposals this legislative session and has even pushed through one bill that puts many young people at risk. The party has not earned its rhetoric as a champion of children\u2019s well-being.\n\nA notable example is SB 1435 (introduced by Republican Ochoa Bogh), which sought to support the removal of obscene materials from K-8 classrooms and school libraries by aligning California law with federal broadcasting standards. This innocuous bill to make educational environments safer for young students failed to pass beyond the Senate Education Committee. Three Democrat senators opposed the measure, dismissing it as a \u201cbook-banning\u201d bill.\n\nYet if materials are deemed inappropriate for a general audience under federal broadcasting rules, it stands to reason they should also be considered inappropriate for children, especially in K-8 educational settings. Another bill, AB 3080 (introduced by Republican Juan Alanis), proposed to strengthen online protections for children by requiring businesses that offer products or services that are illegal for minors, such as pornography, to verify users\u2019 age with government-issued ID.\n\nDespite passing unanimously in the Assembly and facing no opposition in the Senate Judiciary Committee, AB 3080 was halted by the Senate Appropriations Committee chaired by Democrat Sen. Anna Caballero, who effectively killed the bill by leaving it on the committee\u2019s suspense file. \n\nBut Democrats\u2019 greatest hypocrisy by far is claiming to care about \u201cparental consent\u201d when it comes to online content as they work overtime to kill the parental notification policies enacted by local school boards. These policies arose after a growing number of parents reported that schools were lying to them about their children changing their names and gender at school.\n\nOne particularly egregious example occurred in the Newport-Mesa school district in Orange County, where last year a parental rights group \u201cobtained hundreds of pages of emails and documents\u201d showing that the district was involved in the social gender \u201ctransitioning\u201d of 23 students \u2014 \u201ceight of them elementary school age\u201d \u2014 without informed parental consent from 2020 to 2022. \n\nIn response to incidents like these, over a dozen California school districts passed policies requiring schools to notify parents of any changes to their child\u2019s official or unofficial records. California Attorney General Rob Bonta has targeted school districts that adopted these policies, most notably suing Chino Valley Unified for implementing the first parental notification policy. Litigation on this issue continues in several cases in both state and federal court.\n\nRather than waiting for ongoing litigation to resolve, Democrats in the legislature pushed through AB 1955 (introduced by Democrat Chris Ward), which bans districts from adopting parental notification policies, and ostensibly allows school districts to create and maintain separate \u2014 and often secret \u2014 files or \u201cunofficial records\u201d for students, intentionally concealing information from parents. \n\nBut AB 1955 defies federal law that requires parents to have complete access to their children\u2019s school records at all times. Legal challenges to the new law are expected before it goes into effect in January.\n\nHow can Democrats champion parental involvement for online platforms but condemn it when it comes to something as life-altering as gender \u201ctransitioning?\u201d\n\nWill O\u2019Neill, mayor of Newport Beach, captured the absurdity of the Democrats\u2019 stance perfectly: \u201cIn other words, [Attorney General Rob Bonta] wants a kid to get parent consent before joining Instagram, but not before changing gender.\u201d\n\nCalifornia voters should recognize the gap between the Democrats\u2019 rhetoric on the new social media law and their actions when it comes to protecting children.
