The vote came after a tense 2-hour meeting attended by over 100 community members who showed up at the Historic Rutherford County Courthouse in Murfreesboro, about 34 miles from Nashville, to hear debate on the resolution.\n\nThe resolution directed the library to \u201cremove material that promotes, encourages, advocates for or normalizes transgenderism or \u2018gender confusion\u2019 in minors.\u201d\n\nAfter the vote was taken, a group of supporters of the resolution, who showed up wearing white shirts, erupted with cheers and clapping. Opponents, who heckled the board throughout the meeting, shouted things like \u201cNazis!\u201d at the library board. During debate on the resolution, audience members would break out in cheers after a board member spoke in favor of their position.\n\nCody York, who introduced the measure, said that he did so because the board had an obligation to protect children.\n\n\u201cThe library board is expending money to keep books on the shelf. By just keeping a book we are making a decision to expend funds, taxpayer dollars, to keep those books there,\u201d York said. \u201cBooks that promote transgender ideology are harmful to children.\u201d\n\nYork referenced detransitioners across the country who have sued their doctors for performing transgender medical procedures on them.\n\n\u201cThe state and federal government have determined that these are harmful practices,\u201d York said, pointing to President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order that the federal government would not promote transgender procedures on kids. \u201cThe fact that some children in our community struggle with gender confusion means that we should be equipping them to successfully deal with the dangers of, and root cause of, that danger.\u201d\n\nBefore the votes, 10 community members were given 3 minutes each to speak.\n\n\u201cIf we cause children to go down this road, they can make decisions they will regret for the rest of their lives. When we expose them to things that they don\u2019t have a level to understand, it\u2019s really sexualizing them,\u201d a woman named Michelle said, urging the board to take away books promoting transgender ideology. \u201cChildren, they don\u2019t have a capacity for this. If we say we love them, if we say that \u2018you are loved,\u2019 \u2018we loved you,\u2019 we should want to tell that person the truth. Love is truth.\u201d\n\nUnder the new policy, staff at libraries across the county would have to flag books promoting transgender ideology to kids and turn them over to the board for evaluation.\n\nBoard members who voted in favor included York, Marzee Woodard, Dina Piazza, and Susan Quesenberry. Those who voted against included Benjamin Groce, Kory Wells, and Rollie Holden.\n\nPreviously, in the meeting the board voted to remove a book called \u201cMe & My Dysphoria Monster,\u201d a children\u2019s illustrated book that tells the story of a boy who believes that he is a girl who meets a \u201ctrans man\u201d who teaches him about gender dysphoria.\n\nThat vote was 5-2 along almost the same lines as the other vote, except with an abstention from Holden.\n\nTennessee state lawmakers have already moved to get sexually explicit books out of school libraries, and this new Rutherford County resolution would enact a similar policy at the county level for transgender ideology.",
