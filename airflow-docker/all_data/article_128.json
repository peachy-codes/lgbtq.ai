On March 13, Trump derided trans women in sports during remarks with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte. In that meeting, Trump told members of the press that Democrats have \u201cbad politics\u201d on trans rights, scoffing at what he deemed \u201cmen being able to play in women\u2019s sports\u201d and remarking that Republicans could once again use it as a wedge issue.\n\n\u201c[I]n a way, I want them [Democrats] to keep doing it [talking about trans athletes], because I don\u2019t think they can win a race,\u201d Trump said. He added that he had told other Republicans, \u201c\u2018Don\u2019t bring that subject up, because there\u2019s no election right now. But about a week before the election, bring it up, because you can\u2019t lose.\u2019\u201d\n\nPrior to those remarks, Trump also complained that \u201c[e]verything is transgender, everybody transgender\u201d during a March 12 meeting with Irish Prime Minister Miche\u00e1l Martin, echoing his previous statement to Time that trans rights have \u201cripped apart our country.\u201d Trump went on to claim that \u201cthat is why we won the election,\u201d and that trans women \u201care hurting [cisgender] women very badly.\u201d (Trump previously made the false claim that trans women athletes are a physical danger to cis women during his joint address to Congress in early March.)\n\n\nIf Trump did indeed tell Republican lawmakers not to bring up trans athletes until closer to their next elections, it doesn\u2019t seem like anyone was listening. (It\u2019s not clear which elections Trump was referring to, though some gubernatorial and state legislative races are set to take place in the U.S. this year prior to the 2026 midterms.) South Carolina Rep. Nancy Mace, in particular, has made flagrant transphobia into a personal brand, issuing numerous calls on social media for trans women to be excluded from women\u2019s spaces with her adopted slogan \u201cHold the Line.\u201d Trump himself has made his trans sports ban a top priority in his first two months in office, using the specter of trans athletes to justify sweeping funding freezes for multiple university systems.\n\nIn the 2024 elections, Republicans \u2014 with Trump at the helm \u2014 laid siege to Democrats on trans-inclusive athletics, spending millions on ads that cast former Vice President Kamala Harris as a far-left radical for trans rights. In reality, Harris and many other Democratic candidates largely avoided talking about trans people at all; late in the campaign, after Republicans had already put Democrats on the defensive, Harris stated only that her administration would \u201cfollow the law\u201d regarding the treatment of incarcerated trans people.\n\nTrump\u2019s statements last week came amid ongoing speculation that Democrats lack a coherent plan for advancing trans rights. Since Harris\u2019 loss, some Democrats have accepted the Republican framing that their party is too radical, apparently including Delaware Rep. Sarah McBride, the first out trans woman to serve in Congress. One week after Trump\u2019s remarks, McBride \u2014 herself the target of denigrating remarks by Mace and other GOP lawmakers \u2014 confirmed to NOTUS that she had told fellow Democrats they must \u201ccreate more space in our tent\u201d and \u201cinclude people who have a range of thoughts\u201d on the rights of trans people without \u201cexcommunicating\u201d dissenters.\n\n\u201cA binary choice between being all-on or all-off is not constructive for anyone [...] It impedes the very needed path toward winning electorally, winning hearts and minds and, most importantly, winning progress,\u201d McBride told NOTUS.\n\nMcBride reportedly shared this perspective with Massachusetts Rep. Seth Moulton, one of several Democrats who claimed that Harris had lost because of trans rights mere days after the 2024 elections. Moulton told NOTUS that Congressional Democrats, even now, have not held formal conversations about how to handle trans topics in general, \u201cbecause people are still scared to have them.\u201d\n\nThat mindset isn\u2019t limited to the House, either. California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a potential candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2028, was once an outspoken booster of LGBTQ+ causes like marriage equality. But Newsom appears to have fully retreated on trans-inclusive athletics, conceding to right-wing propagandists Charlie Kirk and Michael Savage without a fuss in the first two episodes of Newsom\u2019s podcast earlier this month.\n\nDespite the reportedly ongoing disorganization within the party, Senate Democrats successfully blocked a Republican-sponsored bill several weeks ago that would have banned trans women and girls from women\u2019s sports leagues in K-12 schools and public universities. Whether a repeat performance is possible has yet to be determined.",
