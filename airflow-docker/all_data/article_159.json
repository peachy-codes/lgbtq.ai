Nancy Mace (R-SC) after a transgender activist allegedly assaulted the congresswoman, leaving her in a wrist brace.\n\n\u201cJust got off the phone with @Realdonaldtrump,\u201d Mace said on Wednesday, the day after the reported assault.\n\n\u201cThank you, Mr. President, for checking in on me and for standing up for women,\u201d she continued. \u201cWe cannot wait to see you back in the White House. #HoldTheLine.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s call to Mace came after she revealed on X that she was \u201cphysically accosted at the Capitol tonight by a pro-tr*ns man.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne new brace for my wrist and some ice for my arm and it\u2019ll heal just fine. The Capitol police arrested the guy. Your tr*ns violence and threats on my life will only make me double down. FAFO,\u201d she said, using her frequently used mantra, \u201cHold the Line.\u201d\n\nU.S. Capitol Police confirmed the incident.\n\n\u201cTonight, the United States Capitol Police (USCP) arrested a person who is accused of assaulting a U.S. Representative,\u201d a Capitol Police spokesperson said.\n\n\u201cJust before 6:00 p.m., the Member of Congress\u2019 office reported an incident in the Rayburn House Office Building. House Division officers, and agents with the Threat Assessment Section, tracked down the suspect,\u201d the spokesperson continued, confirming that the suspect \u2014 identified as 33-year-old James McIntyre of Illinois \u2014 has been arrested.\n\n\u201cMcIntyre is facing a charge for Assaulting a Government Official,\u201d the spokesperson added.\n\nMace has continued to face a wave of hate from the radical left over her insistence that biological men should not use single-sex spaces designated for women, pushing a measure to ensure that only women are using women\u2019s facilities in the U.S. Capitol. That comes as transgender Delaware Rep.-elect Sarah McBride (D) \u2014 a man who believes he is a woman \u2014 is joining the House of Representatives in January.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to allow biological men into women\u2019s private spaces,\u201d Mace said, defending her position.\u201dI will stand in the brink and stand in the way of anyone on the radical left who thinks that it\u2019s ok for a penis to be in a women\u2019s locker room or a bathroom or a changing room. Hell no, I\u2019m not going to stand for it.\u201d\n\nDuring that interview, which occurred prior to Tuesday\u2019s incident, Mace said she had received death threats over her common sense position.\n\n\u201cWhy is it that these crazy people, the insanity, the radical left are willing to kill women over a man\u2019s right to be in a women\u2019s restroom?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cForcing women to share private spaces with men is not dignity and not respect,\u201d she continued. \u201cI\u2019m absolutely going to stand in the way of anyone who thinks it\u2019s ok for a man to be in our locker room and our changing rooms, in our dressing rooms and women\u2019s bathrooms.\u201d\n\nShe later doubled down with the Stop the Invasion of Women\u2019s Spaces Act, which would block biological men from using single-sex spaces for women \u2014 restrooms, locker rooms, and changing rooms \u2014 at all federally-funded facilities.\n\n\u201cNever want to hear the Left call themselves the party of love and tolerance ever again,\u201d Mace said on X on Wednesday following the incident.\n\u201cThe Left is the party of Violence Against Women,\u201d she continued, casting doubt that she would hear a condemnation of the violence from those who oppose her position, such as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), who bizarrely asserted that preventing biological men from using women\u2019s facilities endangers women.",
