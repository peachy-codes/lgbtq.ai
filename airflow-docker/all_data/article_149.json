She had attended Creswell during her middle school years and came away emotionally distressed.\n\nNMPD described what she planned to do:\n\nShe drew a map from her memories of the layout of the school. In the map, she specified the locations of classrooms, common areas, and where the entrances and exits were located. She outlined how she would progress through the school, who she would target and in what sequence, and where she would commit suicide within the school once she was done. Knowing access to the interior of the school was highly restricted during school hours, she detailed an elaborate plan to enter the school without being stopped or detected so she could begin her attack with the element of surprise.\n\nDuring the first six months of 2019 she continued plans to target Creswell: \u201cHer OCD was manifest during this time with the excruciating detail she gave to the attack, including precise timelines, detailed descriptions of the clothing she would wear, and the specific route she would progress through the school. The more she pored over the details, the more convinced she was of her own success. The \u2018rage storms\u2019 that interspersed these plans also became more heated, showing Hale\u2019s anger was reaching the boiling point.\u201d\n\nShe brooded over her plan extensively, wanting to become a \u201cgod\u201d as she believed the Columbine killers had done. She would follow in their steps \u201cby killing victims nobody would forget: children.\u201d\n\nHowever, by March 2020 the transgender-identifying individual\u2019s thinking began to change, the police report detailed:\n\nHale began to express doubts about targeting Creswell Middle. Her doubts weren\u2019t necessarily about the intention to kill children, but more about the racial demographics of the school. Hale knew a large portion of the student body was black. Though she had no qualms about killing anyone regardless of specific demographical categories, she worried she might be branded as a racist, which would remove her ability to give the motive and reasoning for the attack and [instead] allow others to choose it for her once she was dead.\n\nShe continued to plan to attack Creswell until April 8, 2021, at which time she shifted her plan to the Covenant Christian school. She believed Covenant was a better target for three reasons:  \u201c(1) [It] was more geographically isolated than Creswell Middle, which she felt would give her more time to kill; (2) \u2026 being a private Christian school, she would receive more notoriety; and (3) due to the student body at Creswell Middle being predominantly black, she was afraid she would be seen as a racist\u2026\u201d\n\nThe threat of the racism label made her worry that the motive for the attack and narrative of it would spin out of control once she died.",
