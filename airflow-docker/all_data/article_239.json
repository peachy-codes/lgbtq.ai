Yet public opinion has shifted, with Americans now opposing the presence of men in women\u2019s bathrooms, locker rooms, prisons, and sports teams. (Nearly 80 percent of Americans oppose allowing men in women\u2019s sports, according to a recent New York Times poll.)\n\nIf Democrats back down, they will be endorsing actions they condemned as bigoted just months ago.
