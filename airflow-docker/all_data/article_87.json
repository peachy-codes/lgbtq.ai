The pause impacts eight public colleges within UMS, and a spokesperson confirmed on Tuesday that the affected schools have been notified. \ufffc\n\nAccording to the spokesperson, the email notice from the USDA read in part, \u201cThis pause is temporary in nature while USDA evaluates if it should take any follow-on actions related to prospective Title VI or Title IX violations. Please take any necessary actions to effectuate this direction from leadership. This pause will remain in effect until further notice.\u201d \ufffc\n\nThe spokesperson also stated that the schools impacted were not aware of any Title VI or Title IX violations, but was reserving judgment until \u201cfurther analysis is completed.\u201d \ufffc\n\nPresident Trump warned during a White House event in late February that he would cut funding to Maine schools if the state continued to allow trans-identifying males to compete on girls\u2019 and women\u2019s sports teams. \ufffc\n\nThe following day, Governor Janet Mills (D-ME) threatened to take legal action against the Trump administration if he did so \u2014 after which Trump called Mills out directly during a bipartisan Governors Working Session. \ufffc\n\n\u201cIs Maine here? The governor of Maine? Are you not going to comply with it?\u201d Trump asked. \ufffc\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll comply with state and federal law,\u201d Governor Janet Mills said. \ufffc\n\n\u201cWe are the federal law. You better do it. Because you\u2019re not going to get any federal funding at all if you don\u2019t,\u201d Trump warned. \u201cAnd by the way, your population, even though it is somewhat liberal although I did very well there. Your population doesn\u2019t want men playing in women\u2019s sports. You better comply because otherwise you\u2019re not getting any federal funding.\u201d \ufffc\n\nMills pushed back, saying, \u201cWe\u2019ll see you in court.\u201d",
