  "content": "Trans Technologies, a new book from MIT Press and written by University of Michigan researcher and faculty member Oliver L. Haimson, Ph.D. explores the creative and novel ways technologies are being utilized to address the inequalities the transgender community faces, highlight and correct misinformation, and grow safety, acceptance, equitability, and visibility.\n\n\u201cTrans technologies,\u201d as Haimson explains in the book (he also includes definitions from trans tech creators), are \u201cbuilt or adapted to address the specific concerns and needs of trans people and communities.\u201d On a more theoretical level, trans technologies \u201cembody or support themes or characteristics of transness.\u201d Haimson uses a broad brush to paint his definition, adapting the concept to a wide variety of digital and analog applications \u201cdesigned or adapted to help address some of the challenges transgender people face,\u201d including basic needs such as access to society, employment, health care, and housing. Examples include, but are not limited to:\n\nApps \u2013 U-Signal, a prototype smartphone and smartwatch app to aid transgender people of color in identifying and reporting threats to their safety. The Safe Transgender Bathroom app (2021-22) helped trans people find safe/gender-neutral restrooms.\nMaps \u2013 Trans activist and journalist Erin Reed created a map to assist trans people with finding health care providers who offer hormone therapy without requiring patients to obtain a letter of eligibility \u201cfrom a therapist or psychiatrist.\u201d Reed also created a map to identify legislative attacks against the transgender community in each state.\nWebsites \u2013 The Digital Transgender Archive offers a collection of historical transgender materials, including periodicals, news articles, photography.\nBrowser extensions \u2013 Deadname Remover updates \u201ctrans people\u2019s previous names with their current ones,\u201d while Gender Neutralize replaces gendered terms with \u201cgender-neutral alternatives.\u201d\nVideo games, augmented reality, and virtual reality \u2013 Through the Wardrobe uses augmented reality to empower \u201cvisitors [to] try out new identities via clothing and other artifacts.\u201d Trans Fucking Rage Jam (2022) gave trans game developers the agency to channel their anger over anti-trans legislation into creative projects. Woven throughout the book, \u201ccare\u201d and \u201cambivalence\u201d serve as grounding forces, illustrating the (sometimes simultaneous) push and pull each trans tech creator faces in concepting and creating technology to meet their own individual needs or, more ideally, working with the broader transgender community, including people with multiple marginalized identities, to address one or more of the 14 categories of challenges transgender people face, as identified by Haimson and his team of researchers. The U-Signal prototype addresses \u201cracial injustice,\u201d for example, while the Safe Transgender Bathroom app targeted \u201caccess to society.\u201d Another category, \u201cpressure to educate cisgender people about trans identities,\u201d includes The Trans Language Primer, a web site that defines more than 200 LGBTQ terms.\n\n\u201cTrans care\u201d demonstrates the ways transgender people \u201cshow up for each other when society and family fail them.\u201d Meanwhile, ambivalence, a word Haimson notes \u201chas a particularly trans quality,\u201d involves \u201ctwo or more distant (maybe opposite) poles between which a person wavers and that they contemplate simultaneously.\u201d For example, trans tech creators \u201chave agency to create technology that addresses some trans needs,\u201d but can\u2019t solve the societal issues at the root of them \u2013 a moving target that continues to grow with each anti-LGBTQ executive order issued, law enacted, and the continued proliferation of hate speech online and in public settings.\n\nAnother ambivalence includes funding sources for trans technology: \u201ccapitalist and anticapitalist approaches, funders\u2019 values and community values, paid work and volunteer work, profit and mutual aid,\u201d among others. \u201cWhile each of these pairs may seem like opposites,\u201d Haimson explains, \u201cin reality they are closer than they seem,\u201d and may involve more than one approach.\n\nTrans Technologies comes at a critical moment for the transgender community. Since assuming office in January, President Donald Trump has spent an outsize amount of time targeting transgender people and censoring evidence of their existence. These efforts include restricting federal websites from nearly 200 words used to describe marginalized people and communities, including LGBTQ, gender-affirming care, transgender, nonbinary, Black, race and racism, DEI, and yes, even the word \u201cmarginalized\u201d itself.\n\nAlso at risk is important and life-saving academic research. President Trump\u2019s recent anti-transgender executive orders have attempted to withdraw hundreds of research grants at several prominent educational institutions. In response, and to protect federal funding, universities throughout the country are scaling back or ending DEI efforts.\n\nHaimson explained to GLAAD the cooling effect the Trump Administration\u2019s harmful actions could have on future transgender research, including studies on the impact of trans technology on the community:\n\n\u201cThe funding cuts to scientific research and universities will have tangible negative effects for so many marginalized groups, including trans people,\u201d Haimson said.\n\n\u201cWith the crackdown on \u2018DEI\u2019 research and the list of words that academics have been advised to no longer use in grant proposals, research that aims to improve trans people\u2019s life chances is unlikely to be funded in the future (at least in the next four years). I have already seen my colleagues who are doing crucial trans health research have their NIH grant funding taken away, which means that we will have less knowledge about health disparities and action towards how to address them.\u201d\n\nHaimson warned that the absence of federal funding will require the support of trans folks \u201cwho typically have very little financial means and resources.\u201d\n\nTrans Technologies is the result of interviews with more than 100 English-speaking technology creators, 80 percent of whom are transgender and/or nonbinary. Haimson acknowledges this limitation in not including non-Western technologies and perspectives, and that he and many of his interviewees come from \u201crelatively privileged\u201d backgrounds in terms of education and socio-economic status. Regardless, Trans Technologies offers readers a thorough, yet approachable look at the types of technologies and their effects, both positive and negative, on transgender people and the trans community at large.\n\nTrans Technologies can be purchased through most major booksellers. A digital edition of the book is also available at no cost on the MIT Press website.",
