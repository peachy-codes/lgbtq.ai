During a hearing, several drag queens and activists in provocative makeup and outfits made threats to the city council and claimed to be fighting for their lives as they demanded that the local members pass the resolution.\n\nOne drag queen with blue hair and heavy makeup threatened that trans people would make Worcester \u201ca very unsafe place\u201d if they did not get their way.\n\n\u201cI am multiply disabled \u2026 I am on the autism spectrum and I have narcolepsy so I couldn\u2019t drive myself here, I had to hide from my driver that I was in drag, which is not an easy thing to do in drag \u2026 The reason that Worcester needs to be a safe space for trans people is because I can\u2019t go home where I can\u2019t work, I can\u2019t qualify for disability, I can\u2019t drive because I am narcoleptic and my family doesn\u2019t support me because I\u2019m trans and then come to a city council that won\u2019t listen to my voice,\u201d the blue haired drag queen said. \u201cI need the city to protect me because no one else will. And, I need the city to protect me because the federal government won\u2019t, and if you think you\u2019re afraid of Trump, you should see how afraid of Trump I am. If you say that you\u2019re afraid of Trump and that\u2019s why you don\u2019t want the city to be a safe space for trans people, you better prepare for trans people to make this a very unsafe space.\u201d (RELATED: \u2018You\u2019re Welcome To Tell Me\u2019: Host Lost For Words After Canada\u2019s Top Conservative Asks Him How Many Genders There Are)\n\nOther members, including one identifying herself as a professor at Worcester State University, claimed Trump is \u201ctrying to erase\u201d them and ordered the members of the city council to ignore his executive order. More of them said if the council members opposed the resolution, then that would prove they did not mind if transgender people got killed.\n\nOne masked individual covered in tattoos compared Trump to the Ku Klux Klan and labeled him a fascist for requiring the federal government to recognize biological facts.\n\n\u201cRight now in our country, Trump is threatening the trans and gender diverse community,\u201d one masked person covered in tattoos said. \u201cHe is using policy to take away protections, he is making it harder for trans people to renew passports and get the care they need. He is trying to erase us. These are no anxieties, these are indisputable facts. And he will not stop with trans people, he will not stop with immigrants, but he is limited, he\u2019s a president, not a king. and he has the powers of the president as well as the limitations of one. So my question to the council is this, if he is going to use policy to hurt people, how can we use it to protect them? How can we stand up to him and say we won\u2019t allow him to dictate what we do in our city?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe stood up against the KKK in 1924 and organizations like the YWCA stand up against equality today,\u201d the person said.\n\nOne individual appearing to be a woman arrived with a painted beard and glitter around her face and raged at the council members demanding she be listened to and taken seriously.

Look at me!\u201d the person screamed. \u201cF*cking pathetic!\u201d\n\nA bearded man in pigtails whined that council members care more about \u201ceasy funding\u201d than the lives of transgender people and do not mind alleged \u201cNazis.\u201d",
