The department previously allowed U.S. passport holders to self-select their sex designations, including an \u201cunspecified\u201d gender marker denoted by the letter X.  The new policy stems from President Trump\u2019s Jan. 20 executive order declaring the U.S. recognizes only two sexes, male and female. \n\nOfficials in Denmark and Finland last month advised transgender and gender-nonconforming citizens to practice caution when traveling to the U.S., and trans people across the nation \u2014 including the actress Hunter Schafer \u2014 have shared on social media stories of their passports being involuntarily updated to reflect their sex at birth, rather than their gender identity\nSeven transgender and nonbinary Americans are challenging the new policy in federal court, arguing it is motivated by \u201cimpermissible animus.\u201d Capital Pride Alliance\u2019s travel advisory Friday said the new State Department policy \u201ccould impact some transgender and nonbinary travelers, so we encourage all visitors to consult official sources and seek legal guidance as needed.\u201d \n\nSmith said WorldPride organizers are addressing visitors\u2019 concerns as they come. \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re communicating as best as possible about the different safety measures,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re talking consistently, and we\u2019re having meetings nearly every single day, all day long, to go through this as well as so many other things.\u201d Council of Governors Vice Chair Charles Allen said he attributes any decline in international travelers to the celebrations next month in Washington \u201ccompletely to the change in administration.\u201d \n\nPotential warnings to visitors from abroad, he said, \u201chave nothing to do with the local communities, the state communities, the County communities, and fall squarely with the incredibly shameful tactics we\u2019ve seen in language from the federal administration.\u201d \n\nAllen added that he was \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d by reports that corporate sponsors had backed away from WorldPride since President Trump\u2019s return to office in January. \u201cIt can\u2019t be lost on us that fear is used as a weapon,\u201d he said. WorldPride organizers have said they expect roughly 2 million people to attend the event, which will run between May 17 and June 8 in Washington.\n",
