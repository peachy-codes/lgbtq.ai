Although she initially alleged that her assailants were the police, she posted to her Story again on Tuesday, clarifying that the incident \u201coccurred prior to any police involvement and is not the result of a wrongful abduction or brutality by the authorities.\u201d\n\nThe drag artist also said that she should have waited until she had clarity on what happened before making a public statement and that she takes \u201cfull accountability that my previous statement does not align with the events of that night.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to take a moment and express a deep gratitude and appreciation for the efforts of those who helped me piece things together with compassion,\u201d she continued.\n\nIn her earlier posts, Venus said she had been abducted, \"handcuffed and tossed around in the back of a truck hatchback.\u201d She further said, \u201cI was choked and kicked for an hour and then they took $1,000 cash from me and my headphones, and then I had to [pay them] hundreds more dollars to get released.\u201d\n\nAlongside the caption, Venus had also posted images of what appear to be bruises on her elbow, stomach, and neck. She also asked if anyone had any legal advice on what she should do about the alleged attack.\n\n\u201cFront desk won\u2019t help me because they think I\u2019m guilty of not paying for my taxi which makes no sense because that\u2019s why I took out cash in the first place,\u201d she said in the first post. \u201cCorruption on every level.\u201d (Venus did not specify which front desk she was talking about.)\n\nIn a second post, Venus shared a photo of a building in the area, which she said is where her attackers \u201cleft me here bleeding on the side of a dark road in the middle of the night after being held handcuffed for hours while they all laughed at me.\u201d She added, \u201cI\u2019m still in shock and I\u2019m not sure what to do.
