  "content": "Georgia Democrats staged a walkout on Wednesday protesting multiple Republican bills that target transgender rights, including one bill that would ban gender-affirming medical care for incarcerated trans people in the state.\n\nSB 185, which came to a vote before the state House of Representatives on Wednesday, would block the use of state funds and resources to provide any medical care for the purpose of \u201caltering primary or secondary sexual characteristics.\u201d Such treatment, including surgeries and hormone therapy, would only be allowed if it is not for the treatment of gender dysphoria \u201cor the purpose [...] is not for sex reassignment.\u201d\n\nAs the Georgia Recorder reported, almost all 80 Democrats in the chamber abruptly walked out rather than cast a vote at all, protesting SB 185 and several other anti-trans GOP bills filed this session. Those bills include a ban on coverage for gender-affirming care in state employees\u2019 health plans (defying a 2023 settlement that required state plans to cover such care); another bill that would prevent doctors from providing gender-affirming care to trans youth, and which would allow puberty blockers only with the consent of a child\u2019s legal guardian and two doctors; and still another blocking trans women and girls from competing in women\u2019s school sports leagues from elementary school through college. The sports bill passed in both chambers and is currently awaiting Republican Gov. Brian Kemp\u2019s signature.\n\nAddressing reporters outside the chamber, Democrats condemned the GOP\u2019s anti-trans agenda and pointed out that even though the legislative session ends on Friday, lawmakers have still not passed a state budget for the year \u2014 the only law they are required to pass, according to WSB-TV.\n\n\u201cThis is day 39, day 39 and we don\u2019t have a budget, and many of our members\u2019 bills have not been heard,\u201d House Minority Leader Carolyn Hugley said, per the Recorder. \u201cWe came here to focus on the opportunity for Georgians to live, learn and earn. And what do we get? Political theater. What do we get? Bills that want to legalize discrimination.\u201d\n\nDemocratic Rep. Ruwa Romman said SB 185 was \u201cstrike three\u201d for her GOP colleagues. \u201cWe have had no bills on raising the minimum wage. We have had one bill pass about housing. We have had no bills on Medicaid expansion,\u201d Romman said. \u201cI don\u2019t even know what\u2019s going on with the budget. And you\u2019re telling me that we are going to spend more time on another bill to discriminate?\u201d\n\nHouse Democratic Caucus Chair Tanya Miller also decried Republicans\u2019 attacks on trans people in a speech on the floor prior to the walkout, as the Associated Press noted. \u201cWhat is going on with my colleagues that they have become obsessed with what is happening in transgender citizens\u2019 pants and their underwear and their bedroom and their medical robes, when they talk to their doctors, when they deal with their families?\u201d Miller wondered.\n\nRepublicans hold a majority in the Georgia House, with 100 representatives to Democrats\u2019 80, meaning SB 185 would have passed even if all Democrats remained in the chamber. The bill passed by a vote of 100-2, with two Democrats \u2014 Reps. Regina Lewis-Ward and David Sampson \u2014 formally registering their disapproval. Three Democrats broke with the party to vote with Republicans in favor of SB 185: Reps. Lynn Heffner, Tangie Herring, and Dexter Sharper. (Heffner inaccurately referred to gender-affirming medical care as \u201celective procedures,\u201d according to the Recorder.) Having passed in both legislative chambers, the bill has now been sent to Kemp for final approval.\n\nIncarcerated trans people\u2019s rights to medical care have become another plank in the Republican anti-trans agenda over the past year, gaining national attention after President Donald Trump used the topic for attack ads against then-Vice President Kamala Harris during the 2024 presidential campaign, in which Trump accused Harris of supporting \u201ctransgender operations on illegal aliens.\u201d House Majority Leader Chuck Efstration echoed Trump\u2019s rhetoric in comments to the AP this week, saying Democrats showed \u201csupport for taxpayer-funded sex change surgeries for state prisoners,\u201d insinuating that was a position for which they should be ashamed.\n\nU.S. law requires the federal government to \u201csupervise and furnish medical treatment and other necessary medical, psychiatric, and related technical and scientific services [...] in penal and correctional institutions of the United States.\u201d The vast majority of health organizations, including the American Medical Association say gender-affirming care is medically necessary.\n\nSince taking office, Trump has sought to end any federal recognition of trans people. His Department of Justice quickly began transferring trans women into men\u2019s prisons, where they face a severely elevated risk of violence. Multiple courts have issued injunctions blocking some of the transfers, but those injunctions apply only to the plaintiffs in those cases, and are not enforced across the board. Incarcerated trans women have since reported being transferred out of women\u2019s facilities, saying their records were changed to mark them as men.",
