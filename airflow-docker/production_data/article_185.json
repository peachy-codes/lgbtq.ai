  "content": "FAIRFAX, VIRGINIA \u2014 A state judge on Friday rejected a Virginia school system\u2019s bid to stop a lawsuit alleging that its transgender policies discriminate against Christian students.\n\nSeveral religious students challenged the school\u2019s policies prohibiting the \u201cdeadnaming\u201d or \u201cmisgendering\u201d of transgender students, as well as policies allowing transgender-identifying students to use the bathroom of those of the opposite sex.\n\nAmerica First Legal (AFL), which argued the case for those students, said in a statement that the judge\u2019s decision amounted to a \u201cruling that [Fairfax County Public Schools] FCPS\u2019 pronoun policy punishing \u2018misgendering\u2019 and bathroom policy based on \u2018gender identity\u2019 violate students\u2019 constitutional rights.\u201d\n\nIn court filings, it said FCPS, one of the nation\u2019s largest districts, had made its animus toward Christians clear, including that \u201crather than take the oath of office by swearing on a Bible, Torah, Koran, or other religious text (as is traditional), the current chair of the school board took his oath on Gender Queer.\u201d (The school board chair, Karl Frisch, followed hardcore gay pornography on Twitter using the same account he used for school board campaigning, and once claimed that \u201cFairfax has a history of being an epicenter for right-wing religious fanaticism.\u201d)\n\nIn court, FCPS focused on technicalities, saying that because the plaintiffs had not actually been disciplined for misgendering, they had no basis to sue. The plaintiffs\u2019 attorney, Ian Prior, argued in court that they had engaged in \u201cself-censorship\u201d by avoiding using pronouns at all, and that a \u201ccredible threat of enforcement\u201d was enough to infringe upon their rights.\n\nFCPS\u2019s attorney, Noah Sullivan of the firm Gentry Locke, replied that self-censorship solved the issue. \u201cTheir religion does not require them to use pronouns or to talk to people at all,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the same applied to bathrooms: normal girls who didn\u2019t want to encounter a transgender person in a bathroom could simply use single-stall bathrooms. \u201cUsing a common bathroom is not a tenet of their religion. They can just use a private bathroom,\u201d he said.\n\nPrior argued in court, \u201cTheir purpose is to make Christians check their constitutional rights at the door and submit to state-sponsored ideology. \u2026 Gender expansive\u2019 students may use any bathroom. Therefore we\u2019re treating gender nonconforming students more favorably than religious ones,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a written filing, Sullivan wrote, \u201cPetitioners have no right, at school, to refer directly to other students by pronouns those students do not accept. It is inherently disruptive and not protected speech within the school setting.\u201d\n\nThe plaintiffs \u201cwere pressured to take a test that required them to answer true or false to the following assertion: \u2018A student has a right to be called by their chosen name and pronoun.\u2019 \u2018True\u2019 was the \u2018correct\u2019 answer,\u201d court papers said.\n\nJudge Brett A Kassabian rejected Fairfax County Public Schools\u2019 bid to throw out the portion of the case dealing with pronouns, writing that \u201cthe Court overrules the Demurrer to Counts I, II, II, and IV.\u201d\n\nIn an interview outside of court, Prior told The Daily Wire that the ruling shows that the judge has accepted his theory of the case, and if he proves facts consistent with it at trial, he is likely to prevail.\n\nFCPS argued that the original girl who brought the case, who said she was followed into the bathroom by a \u201cgender expansive\u201d male, had since graduated, making the case moot. Younger students then joined the case, but FCPS argued that they shouldn\u2019t be able to sue on the bathroom issue unless they could show that they had actually shared a bathroom with a transgender person. (The plaintiffs said they have sought out single-stall bathrooms, which has avoided that scenario.)\n\nKassabian said he did not think \u201cgeneralized anxiety\u201d about using a bathroom knowing that a biological member of the opposite sex could enter was sufficient to show damages, but that the plaintiffs could amend their complaint to address that, and that the girl who graduated could still be owed damages.\n\nPrior said, in written arguments, that FCPS\u2019s bathroom rule \u201ccreates a new class of students\u2014\u2018transgender and gender-expansive students\u2019\u2014and provides them the right to live their daily life in accordance with their secular views of gender fluidity by giving them unrestricted access to the common restrooms [and] elevates this right over the rights of the Petitioners and all other students to live their daily lives in accordance with their faith by denying those students the right to use a common, sex-segregated restroom.\u201d\n\nPrior said that FCPS replaced \u201cbiological gender\u201d with \u201csex assigned at birth\u201d in its curriculum, and when a member of a curriculum committee objected, it removed her from the committee. \u201cThe Respondent cannot seriously claim that most mainstream religions do not believe that sex is determined at birth by God. Thus, its actions to delegitimize that belief through policy would inevitably have consequences for many, if not most, students at FCPS,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe school board cited Department of Education regulations equating \u201cgender identity\u201d with sex, and said federal law supersedes state law. \u201cAll nine [Supreme Court] justices said those portions that define sex as gender are likely unconstitutional,\u201d Prior said, with Sullivan countering that \u201cthere is no formal judgement, courts can change their minds.\u201d\n\nPrior said the same federal regulations that FCPS said are the law of the land are likely to soon change. \u201cThe reality is that there\u2019s a new administration coming in that interprets Title IX in a very different way,\u201d he said.",
