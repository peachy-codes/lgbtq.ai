  "content": "The state of Indiana took a teenage boy from his Catholic parents after he started identifying as a girl.\n\nNow his parents, Jeremy and Mary Cox, have asked the Supreme Court to weigh in on their child custody case, arguing that the Indiana Department of Child Services violated their parental rights and religious liberty when the agency investigated them for refusing to use their son\u2019s \u201cpreferred pronouns\u201d and ultimately kept him from their home while he struggled with an eating disorder.\n\n\u201cIf this can happen in Indiana, it can happen anywhere. Tearing a child away from loving parents because of their religious beliefs, which are shared by millions of Americans, is an outrage to the law, parental rights, and basic human decency,\u201d said Lori Windham, vice president and senior counsel for The Becket Fund for Religious Liberty. \u201cIf the Supreme Court doesn\u2019t take this case, how many times will this happen to other families?\u201d \n\nThe Cox\u2019s son told them of his female identity in 2019, but because of their religious belief that God created human beings with immutable sex, they would not use his \u201cpreferred pronouns,\u201d their attorneys said in a press release. The parents also believe he needed help with underlying mental health concerns, including an eating disorder.\n\n\u201cTo address both issues, they provided therapeutic care for their child\u2019s gender dysphoria and scheduled appointments with a specialist to help him with the eating disorder,\u201d attorneys said.\n\nHowever, the state began investigating the parents in 2021 after a report that they were refusing to use their son\u2019s preferred pronouns or acknowledge him as a girl. The state then removed him from the parents\u2019 home and placed him in a home that affirmed his transgender identity. \n\n\u201cAt the initial trial court hearing, Indiana officials argued the child \u2018should be in a home where she is [ac]cepted for who she is.\u2019 The court restricted the Coxes\u2019 visitation time to a few hours once a week and barred them from speaking to their child about their religious views on human sexuality and gender identity,\u201d according to The Becket Fund. \n\nUltimately, the state ended up abandoning its accusations of abuse but ended up arguing that the parent\u2019s unwillingness to accept his female identity was contributing to his eating disorder. The trial court ended up allowing the state to keep custody of the teen and kept the gag order in place. \n\n\u201cIn short, even though the court agreed that the Coxes were fit parents, it upheld the removal of their child. An appeals court upheld the removal,\u201d attorneys said. \n\nAttorneys for the Coxes told the Supreme Court in its reply brief that the case is of \u201cnationwide importance,\u201d and that the state\u2019s \u201ctack \u2014 blame a comorbidity and dodge adjudication of parental fitness \u2014 provides a playbook that any state can use to eviscerate bedrock constitutional protections while guaranteeing they remain insulated from review.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith increasing frequency, governments run roughshod over parents\u2019 religious beliefs on gender identity, including removing children from parents, favoring certain beliefs in divorce custody disputes, and preventing adoptions,\u201d the brief reads. \u201cThese cases are sure to proliferate. Some state legislatures are now authorizing the state to take custody where parents refuse full-steam-ahead gender transitions.  And by one estimate, ten million students nationwide attend schools that will actively conceal a child\u2019s gender identity from his parents.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis case presents a legal question of nationwide importance: when can the state muzzle parental speech and remove a child from the home of admittedly fit parents? The [lower court decision] squarely conflicts with this Court\u2019s precedents on parental rights, free speech, and religious exercise,\u201d the brief continues. \n\nAttorneys for the Coxes first filed a petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court in September of 2023.
