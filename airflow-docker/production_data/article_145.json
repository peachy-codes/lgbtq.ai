  "content": "After becoming the 266th leader of the Catholic Church in 2013, the late Pope Francis \u2014 n\u00e9e Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio \u2014 established himself as one of the most boundary-pushing popes in modern history. That led a group of five cardinals to issue a list of concerns, or dubia, in October 2023 challenging some of his most radical positions on LGBTQ+ rights and other issues.\n\nStill, in the Catholic church, \u201cradical\u201d is subjective. Francis certainly took many positions that softened Catholic doctrine regarding LGBTQ+ people and issues. That isn\u2019t a hard thing to do, given that his predecessor Pope Benedict believed gay marriage would bring about the apocalypse and some leading bishops even lobbied against an LGBTQ+ suicide hotline. But Francis also contradicted himself and split some very specific hairs regarding LGBTQ+ rights. And on a few issues, like the concept of transgender people, his principles were heavily orthodox.\n\nWith so many different statements released during his papacy, it can be hard to figure out what Pope Francis actually believed, especially about queer and trans people and how we live our lives. Below, we\u2019ve rounded up the highlights from Francis\u2019 papacy to make sense of how Catholicism might have slowly changed under his leadership \u2014 and in what ways it\u2019s still the same old $30 billion tax haven we\u2019re used to.\n\nWhat was Pope Francis\u2019s stance on gay people?\nFrancis generally took the open-ended position that God loves gays and wants them welcomed in the church. In 2013, the Pope famously said that \u201cif someone is gay and is searching for the Lord [...] who am I to judge?\u201d The statement was widely lauded at the time simply for being the first time a pope had ever said the word \u201cgay,\u201d rather than \u201chomosexual,\u201d in public remarks. (Since then, Francis frequently spoke of \u201chomosexuals\u201d in various comments.)\n\nIn 2015, Francis affirmed the ministry of Bishop Jacques Gaillot, who was removed from his ministry in 1995 after he blessed gay couples. In 2018 Francis said that gay Catholics are made and loved by God, and in a surprise meeting at the Vatican in 2020, told families of LGBTQ+ youth that \u201cGod loves your children as they are.\u201d Conversely, Francis excommunicated anti-LGBTQ+ Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigan\u00f2 in 2024, although he did so because of inflammatory statements Vigan\u00f2 made about the Pope himself rather than his views on LGBTQ+ people.\n\nBut while he regularly affirmed queer love in the abstract, the pope was less positive about what all those homosexuals might end up doing with one another. While \u201cbeing homosexual is not a \u201ccrime,\u201d as Francis exhorted in January 2023, he went on to say that \u201cit\u2019s a sin [...] first let\u2019s distinguish between a sin and a crime.\u201d This seemed to contradict another statement Francis made in 2019, when he said the \u201ctendencies\u201d to be gay \u201care not a sin.\u201d\n\nIn particular, Francis said that queer relations between clergy members were a \u201cserious concern\u201d and \u201cworry\u201d him. \u201cThe question of homosexuality is a very serious one,\u201d Francis said in a 2018 book interview, and there was \u201cno room\u201d for anyone in the ministry to enter a queer relationship (though heterosexual ones were still okay). \u201cIn our societies, it even seems homosexuality is fashionable. And this mentality, in some way, also influences the life of the Church,\u201d he fretted, recommending \u201cpersons with this rooted tendency not be accepted into ministry or consecrated life.\u201d\n\nIn 2024, Francis used a homophobic slur while reiterating those fears in two separate closed-door meetings with bishops. Francis said at the time that young gay men should be accepted into the Church itself, but were \u201cbetter off not being welcomed\u201d into seminaries, in which he said there was already \u201ctoo many frociaggine\u201d \u2014 an Italian slur approximately translating to \u201cfaggotness\u201d or \u201cfaggotry.\u201d Vatican spokesperson Matteo Bruni later told reporters that the Pope \u201cnever intended to offend or express himself in homophobic terms, and he extends his apologies to those who were offended by the use of a term that was reported to others.\u201d\n\nDid Pope Francis support same-sex marriage?\nWell, yes, but actually no.\n\nIn December 2023, the Vatican issued a declaration that stated that same-sex couples could receive blessings from Catholic priests. However, the governing body of the Catholic church also maintained that these blessings are not equivalent to a liturgical rite, and should not be confused with marriage.\n\nFrancis was a vocal supporter of legal \u201ccivil unions,\u201d but that\u2019s as far from Church orthodoxy as he was willing to stray. That position dated back to his pre-papal days as Cardinal Bergoglio, when he was a leading proponent for a 2010 same-sex \u201ccivil union\u201d bill in Argentina. As soon as that bill fell through, however, Bergoglio wrote a letter to the Carmelite Nuns of Buenos Aires to sound the alarm about another bill legalizing same-sex \u201cmarriage,\u201d which was ultimately successful. The law represented \u201cthe outright rejection of the law of God,\u201d the pope-to-be wrote at the time, by \u201ca \u2018movement\u2019 of the father of lies,\u201d \u2014 i.e., Satan \u2014 \u201cthat seeks to confuse and deceive the children of God.\u201d\n\nAfter Kim Davis infamously refused to grant same-sex marriage licenses to gay couples as a Kentucky county clerk in 2015, claiming she acted \u201cunder God\u2019s authority,\u201d Pope Francis met with Davis that September during his visit to Washington, D.C. A Vatican statement asserted Francis only interacted with Davis as part of an audience with \u201cseveral dozen persons,\u201d and that their meeting \u201cshould not be considered a form of support of her position.\u201d Davis and her lawyers at the conservative Liberty Counsel have told a different story, saying Francis said he would pray for Davis, \u201cthanked her for her courage and told her to \u2018stay strong.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe pope continued to ride this line for years, calling same-sex marriage \u201ca contradiction\u201d in some 2019 comments that LGBTQ+ figures roundly condemned. Francis doubled down in 2021, saying that since \u201cmarriage\u201d is a God-delivered sacrament, the Church did not have the power to alter its definition. Civil unions can \u201chelp the situation\u201d in a legal sense, he explained, but \u201cmarriage is marriage.\u201d\n\nIn the final years of his life, Pope Francis still held that \u201ccivil unions\u201d were the only way to reconcile the religious and legal definitions of marriage. In his response to five conservative cardinals\u2019 complaints in 2023, Francis expressed support for clergy (like Gaillot) who bless same-sex unions, but only if those blessings \u201cdo not convey a mistaken concept of marriage.\u201d That privilege, he said, was still reserved for \u201ca man and a woman\u201d \u2014 specifically, the ones who are \u201cnaturally open to procreation.\u201d Super.\n\nWhat did Pope Francis think about transgender people?\nWhat the pope said about trans people didn\u2019t always match up with how he treated them. Francis was most infamously known among trans communities for comparing trans people to nuclear weaponry, comments that gave us the best flagging shirts of all time. \u201c[G]ender theory [...] does not recognize the order of creation,\u201d Francis said in a 2014 interview, and thus \u201cman commits a new sin, that against God the Creator\u201d whose design \u201cis written in nature.\u201d Francis reiterated that concept in 2016, writing that trans youth \u201cneed to be helped to accept their own body as it was created\u201d rather than physically transition.\n\nIn 2019, the Vatican distributed a memo entitled \u201cMale and Female He Created Them,\u201d a document which declared both trans and intersex identities \u201conly a \u2018provocative\u2019 display against so-called \u2018traditional frameworks\u2019\u201d that \u201cseek to annihilate the concept of \u2018nature.\u2019\u201d If you\u2019re nonbinary, no, you\u2019re not: that idea is \u201cnothing more than a confused concept of freedom in the realm of feelings and wants,\u201d wrote Cardinal Giuseppe Versaldi in the memo, published by the Vatican Press. In early 2023, Francis went even further: \u201cgender ideology, today, is one of the most dangerous ideological colonizations\u201d in the world, he said, because \u201cit blurs differences and the value of men and women.\u201d Later in the year, he did make an allowance that trans people could receive baptism, but only if doing so would not cause a \u201cscandal.\u201d\n\nBut despite apparently seeing them as unnatural threats to divine creation, Francis at least provided some amount of material support to trans people in need, particularly following the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2020, Francis donated an undisclosed amount of money to a group of unhoused trans sex workers sheltering in an Italian church. Since then, he has gone on to meet with the same group at least five separate times, eating pasta with them and over 1,000 others at a lunch in November, recognizing the Church\u2019s World Day of the Poor. For those trans people, Pope Francis was a major force for good \u2014 at least, more so than he was viewed elsewhere in the world. \u201cWe transgenders in Italy feel a bit more human because the fact that Pope Francis brings us closer to the Church is a beautiful thing,\u201d Carla Segovia told Reuters after the lunch. \u201cBecause we need some love.\u201d\n\nThe disconnect between Francis\u2019 views on transitioning and acceptance of the people who do it was on full display in 2024. On March 25 that year, the Vatican released a 20-page declaration called \u201cInfinite Dignity,\u201d in which Francis denounced both surrogate pregnancy and gender-affirming medical care by claiming both procedures are attempts to \u201cmake oneself God.\u201d Months later, in October, Francis held a private audience with several transgender and intersex Catholics who argued that gender-affirming care itself is a gift from God. Francis reportedly listened \u201cwith empathy,\u201d according to those in attendance, and allegedly said he would \u201cconsider their openness to transgender people as a criteria\u201d when appointing new bishops.\n\nSeveral months later, in February 2025, Doctrine chief Cardinal Victor Manuel Fern\u00e1ndez said in a speech that a person\u2019s transition could be accepted by the Church under \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d \u2014 but maintained that \u201cgender ideology\u201d represents a \u201cclaim to omnipotence,\u201d threatening divine authority.\n\nDid Pope Francis support LGBTQ+ parents and adoption rights?\nOn this, the Pope took a much clearer stance: not on your life. If a \u201cmarriage\u201d is no longer between a man and a woman, then-Cardinal Bergoglio wrote in his 2010 letter to the Carmelite Nuns, adopted children will be irrevocably harmed from growing up with gay parents. \u201cAt stake are the lives of so many children who will be discriminated against in advance,\u201d he lamented, \u201cdepriving them of the human maturation that God wanted to be given with a father and a mother.\u201d (It should be noted that children raised by LGBTQ+ parents develop the same way their peers do, and may even have some advantages.)\n\nFrancis did not officially change his stance after becoming Pope. In 2013, a bishop reported that the pope was \u201cshocked\u201d by a civil union bill in Malta that would have allowed LGBTQ+ couples to adopt. The year after, Francis reiterated that children have \u201ca right to grow up in a family with a father and a mother\u201d and warned against being tempted towards \u201cthe poisonous environment of the temporary.\u201d\n\nDid the Pope at least like my pets?\nBad news! Owning pets is also a metaphysical threat to the fabric of reality, even for straights. \u201cMany, many couples do not have children because they do not want to, or they have just one \u2014 but they have two dogs, two cats,\u201d Francis said in 2022, calling the trend a \u201cdenial of fatherhood or motherhood\u201d that \u201cdiminishes us\u201d and \u201ctakes away our humanity.\u201d We can only imagine what the guy thinks of Sapphics who own more than one litter box.\n\nHow did Pope Francis die?\nPope Francis died on April 21 \u2014 Easter Monday \u2014 after being hospitalized with double pneumonia for five weeks in February and March. Italian newspaper La Repubblica reported that his death may have been the result of a stroke, though Vatican sources had not confirmed the cause at time of writing.\n\nDuring his recovery, Francis continued to make numerous planned trips, including a visit to a Rome prison. One of the Pope\u2019s final appearances was with U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance on April 20, several months after Francis rebuked Vance and the Trump administration on immigration and Vance\u2019s own comments about \u201cChristian love.\u201d (Vance converted to Catholicism in 2019, and has since aligned himself with a religious movement often referred to as \u201cpostliberalism,\u201d whose adherents generally believe that they should seize control of government power to enact anti-LGBTQ+ and anti-immigrant policies.)\n\nThe Vatican stated that in their meeting, Francis and Vance discussed \u201cthe common commitment to protect the right to religious freedom and freedom of conscience.\u201d The two also reportedly held \u201can exchange of views on the international situation, especially regarding countries affected by war, political tensions and difficult humanitarian situations, with particular attention focused on migrants, refugees and those in prison,\u201d per the Vatican.\n\nWho will be the next Pope?\nIt\u2019s still not clear who will succeed Francis and become the Catholic Church\u2019s 267th Pope. There are several possible options the College of Cardinals could select as the new Pope during the imminent conclave; at time of writing, some have identified Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle of the Philippines as a more progressive frontrunner, noting his similarity to Francis\u2019 \u201cpastoral\u201d leadership style (which has reportedly earned him the nickname \u201cthe Asian Francis\u201d). Tagle rejected the Church\u2019s \u201charsh words\u201d against LGBTQ+ people and divorced or unwed parents during a 2015 speech in London, saying lack of religious acceptance \u201cled to their isolation from the wider society.\u201d But like Francis, Tagle is not a full-throated defender of gay or trans rights; earlier that same year, Tagle also backed Francis\u2019 description of the global LGBTQ+ rights movement as \u201cideological colonization,\u201d lamenting to reporters that foreign aid to African nations was conditional on bishops embracing \u201calien\u201d views on topics like same-sex marriage.\n\nAlso among the best-case papal scenarios for LGBTQ+ Catholics is Polish Cardinal Konrad Krajewski, another likely member of the College\u2019s shortlist, Vatican expert John L. Allen Jr. told the New York Post. As the head of Francis\u2019 Dicastery for the Service of Charity, Krajewski was the face of the Church\u2019s international aid and charitable works, visiting Gaza in December 2023 and more recently delivering several ambulances to Ukraine. Krajewski also distributed monetary aid to the group of trans women with whom Francis later shared pasta.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand why this is getting so much attention,\u201d Krajewski told Reuters at the time. \u201cThis is ordinary work for the Church, it\u2019s normal. This is how the Church is a field hospital.\u201d",

Owning pets is also a metaphysical threat to the fabric of reality, even for straights. \u201cMany, many couples do not have children because they do not want to, or they have just one \u2014 but they have two dogs, two cats,\u201d Francis said in 2022, calling the trend a \u201cdenial of fatherhood or motherhood\u201d that \u201cdiminishes us\u201d and \u201ctakes away our humanity.\u201d We can only imagine what the guy thinks of Sapphics who own more than one litter box.\n\nHow did Pope Francis die?\nPope Francis died on April 21 \u2014 Easter Monday \u2014 after being hospitalized with double pneumonia for five weeks in February and March. Italian newspaper La Repubblica reported that his death may have been the result of a stroke, though Vatican sources had not confirmed the cause at time of writing.\n\nDuring his recovery, Francis continued to make numerous planned trips, including a visit to a Rome prison. One of the Pope\u2019s final appearances was with U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance on April 20, several months after Francis rebuked Vance and the Trump administration on immigration and Vance\u2019s own comments about \u201cChristian love.\u201d (Vance converted to Catholicism in 2019, and has since aligned himself with a religious movement often referred to as \u201cpostliberalism,\u201d whose adherents generally believe that they should seize control of government power to enact anti-LGBTQ+ and anti-immigrant policies.)\n\nThe Vatican stated that in their meeting, Francis and Vance discussed \u201cthe common commitment to protect the right to religious freedom and freedom of conscience.\u201d The two also reportedly held \u201can exchange of views on the international situation, especially regarding countries affected by war, political tensions and difficult humanitarian situations, with particular attention focused on migrants, refugees and those in prison,\u201d per the Vatican.\n\nWho will be the next Pope?\nIt\u2019s still not clear who will succeed Francis and become the Catholic Church\u2019s 267th Pope. There are several possible options the College of Cardinals could select as the new Pope during the imminent conclave; at time of writing, some have identified Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle of the Philippines as a more progressive frontrunner, noting his similarity to Francis\u2019 \u201cpastoral\u201d leadership style (which has reportedly earned him the nickname \u201cthe Asian Francis\u201d). Tagle rejected the Church\u2019s \u201charsh words\u201d against LGBTQ+ people and divorced or unwed parents during a 2015 speech in London, saying lack of religious acceptance \u201cled to their isolation from the wider society.\u201d But like Francis, Tagle is not a full-throated defender of gay or trans rights; earlier that same year, Tagle also backed Francis\u2019 description of the global LGBTQ+ rights movement as \u201cideological colonization,\u201d lamenting to reporters that foreign aid to African nations was conditional on bishops embracing \u201calien\u201d views on topics like same-sex marriage.\n\nAlso among the best-case papal scenarios for LGBTQ+ Catholics is Polish Cardinal Konrad Krajewski, another likely member of the College\u2019s shortlist, Vatican expert John L. Allen Jr. told the New York Post. As the head of Francis\u2019 Dicastery for the Service of Charity, Krajewski was the face of the Church\u2019s international aid and charitable works, visiting Gaza in December 2023 and more recently delivering several ambulances to Ukraine. Krajewski also distributed monetary aid to the group of trans women with whom Francis later shared pasta.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand why this is getting so much attention,\u201d Krajewski told Reuters at the time. \u201cThis is ordinary work for the Church, it\u2019s normal. This is how the Church is a field hospital.\u201d",
