  "content": "Even before President Donald Trump took office for his second term, transgender Americans reported harassment and discrimination while traveling. But in January, the administration announced it would no longer issue \u201cX\u201d gender markers on passports or allow transgender Americans to update passports to accurately reflect who they are. The announcement coincided with a slew of executive orders targeting transgender people.\n\nSince then, many trans people have started making preparations to travel abroad. But how safe is it to travel and what documents are needed? With reports of federal officials seizing documents circulating on social media and anxiety running high, The 19th asked the country\u2019s best experts on trans documents some of the hardest questions on what trans travelers should expect. Here\u2019s what we learned:\n\nIs my passport that has an updated gender marker still valid?\nYes. In the first days of the Trump administration, confusion was rampant. The State Department has since clarified that all current valid passports, including those with \u201cX\u201d gender markers, will be honored.\n\nAdvocates caution that transgender travelers may still face harassment from state and federal officials who feel emboldened by the apparent hostility coming from the Trump administration.\n\nArli Christian, senior policy counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), advises transgender travelers to carry backup documents like a birth certificate and a copy of the federal policy to give them more leverage and confidence.\n\n\u201cReally make sure you\u2019re armed with all the information you need to calmly inform an officer what your rights are,\u201d Christian said.\n\nCan I still update the gender marker on my passport to reflect who I am post transition?\nNot now, but maybe soon. For now, the State Department is not accepting requests to update gender markers to correctly reflect transgender people\u2019s genders. In fact, many transgender people have applied for passports since Trump took office and received documents back with an inaccurate gender marker. \n\nBut Carl Charles, a senior attorney in the southern regional office of Lambda Legal, the nation\u2019s largest LGBTQ+ legal group, said in an informational session for the general public this month that those looking for updated passports still have reason for hope.\n\nThe ACLU is suing the Trump administration over the gender marker passport policy, and the organization is seeking a preliminary injunction, or an immediate halt to the policy, while the case plays out in court. A judge is expected to rule on the injunction within the next few weeks.\n\n\u201cIf it is the case that the judge enters an injunction and stops this passport policy from being in effect, that may be the time when people with upcoming renewals or soon-to-expire passports want to submit a passport application, because there may be a chance there may be a window that they can get a document with a correct gender marker,\u201d Charles said.\n\nWhat if I want to revert my gender marker back to my sex assigned at birth for safety reasons?\nThe 19th has confirmed a handful of cases in which transgender people or the parents of transgender youth have successfully reverted documents back to a marker reflecting a person\u2019s sex assigned at birth. For some, including those with \u201cX\u201d gender markers, this can feel like a safer option because they may face less scrutiny from officials.\n\nWill my documents be seized if I reenter the country?\nA number of transgender people have expressed reluctance to leave the United States for fear that their passports will be confiscated upon their return.\n\nThe 19th has not found confirmed cases of this happening, and Lambda Legal, which is tracking several transgender travelers, has not either.\n\nDoes Canada accept my \u201cX\u201d gender marker? Is Canada trans friendly?\nYes, and yes.\n\n\u201cThe Government of Canada recognizes the \u2018X\u2019 gender identifier,\u201d according to a government page designed specifically for LGBTQ+ travelers.\n\nThe 19th got the same response from multiple Canadian officials, who noted that transgender Americans would be welcome to come to Canada as tourists, temporary residents or even asylum seekers.\n\n\u201cIn my personal opinion, Canadians would welcome Americans to Canada,\u201d said Kate Rogers, a spokesperson from Canada\u2019s tourism agency, in an email. \u201cAnd, as part of the LGBTQ2+ community, the Government of Canada supports this community as does the Canadian Border Services Agency.\u201d\n\nI have to get a passport for my children. Will using my passport as a trans person applying for my kids put me at risk of document seizure?\nChristian advises that this is likely safe but that applicants should use caution, adding that the State Department does not have the right to update a person\u2019s passport if they are not the applicant.\n\n\u201cI would certainly use the birth certificate as proof of citizenship rather than sending in your fully valid U.S. passport,\u201d they said. \u201cBecause the concern I would have is that the State Department will see that passport, see that they may notice that the sex designation is not sex at birth, according to their new policy, and they may take it upon themselves to go ahead and update that.\u201d\n\nIs it still safe to fly with my driver\u2019s license? What if my license has an \u201cX\u201d designation?\nEvery piece of guidance from advocates, both formal and anecdotal, suggests that state IDs and driver\u2019s licenses are not impacted by the State Department policy.\n\nAmy Paris, who formerly worked for the federal government and led the implementation of \u201cX\u201d gender markers on passports, told The 19th that as of now, Transportation Security Administration officials have not been advised to scrutinize gender markers in screenings.\n\n\u201cIf they have a state-issued REAL ID in their proper gender, in the gender they identify with, they will probably be able to fly just fine,\u201d Paris said.\n\nBut Paris also urged caution, especially for gender-nonconforming travelers. \u201cI hate that we\u2019re talking about passing privilege here, but it\u2019s just a fact,\u201d Paris said.\n\n\u201cIf it is more likely that a transportation security officer is going to identify you as trans, then I would say, yeah, if it\u2019s possible to take the bus or the train and you\u2019re worried about getting unnecessarily patted down, or having your documentation questioned, the bus or the train is probably a better mode of travel,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvocates are recommending that trans people don\u2019t use passports domestically \u2014 why?\n\u201cI think a lot of what we\u2019re trying to do is reduce the possibility of undue scrutiny, harassment, discrimination, as you\u2019re moving through security and so again, every individual is really best suited to know what that looks like for them,\u201d Christian said. \u201cBut if you\u2019ve got a passport that has a sex designation that does not match who you are, and a state ID that does, my recommendation would be to use that state ID.\u201d\n\n",
