The department also stopped allowing people to change the gender listed on their passport or get new ones that reflect their gender rather than their sex assigned at birth. The head of the transgender group LGBT+ Denmark, Susanne Branner, told Danish radio RadioIII her group had reached out to the country\u2019s foreign ministry earlier in the week and asked for the update of the advisory.\n\n\nShe said there are a few thousand people in Denmark who have changed their legal gender and who might encounter unpleasant situations at airports when trying to enter the U.S. or could even be denied entry because their passports do not reflect the gender assigned at birth. \u201cIf you are transgender or have an X in your passport, can you risk being denied entry? We would like concrete answers to this,\u201d Branner told RadioIII.\n\nOther European countries have also changed their official advisories for members of the transgender community in a reflection to the situation in the U.S.\n\nThe German foreign ministry put out an advisory earlier this month, telling \u201ctravelers who have the gender entry \u2018X\u2019 or whose current gender entry differs from their gender entry at birth\u201d to contact a U.S. diplomatic mission in Germany \u201cbefore entering the country and find out the applicable entry requirements.\u201d\n\nFinland, too, advises prospective U.S. travelers on its foreign ministry homepage that if their \u201ccurrent gender as recorded in their passport differs from the gender they were assigned at birth, U.S. authorities may deny entry.
