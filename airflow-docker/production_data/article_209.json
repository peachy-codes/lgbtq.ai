  "content": "The transgender culture war sure has taken off since those ornery conservatives, snubbed by Obergefell, grabbed hold of the issue and thrust it into the spotlight and down the throats of Americans everywhere \u2014 so say the media.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a misprint, a Babylon Bee joke, or one of Sonny Hostin\u2019s brainless musings. This claim came from none other than paper-of-record The New York Times, which attempted to make the case that after conservatives lost the same-sex marriage fight at the Supreme Court in 2015, \u201cthe religious right went searching for an issue that would re-energize supporters and donors,\u201d and found it in the great transgender debate. In other words, Republicans needed a new red-meat issue they could toss to the base in exchange for donations and energized voters. And though bewildered leftists \u201care still uncertain about how to best navigate the fraught politics of transgender issues,\u201d write authors Adam Nagourney and Jeremy W. Peters, the conservatives who birthed the whole trans controversy have got their cold-hearted strategy down. \n\nThe article is pure propaganda. Besides calling the right\u2019s pushback against science-denial and the sterilization of kids an \u201ceffort to restrict transgender rights\u201d and a \u201cfocus on perceived threats to impressionable children,\u201d the piece cites a Media Matters activist who declares without evidence that these efforts are a product of \u201cgeneral animus\u201d toward transgender-identifying people. (It also lies about the removal of both pornographic books from children\u2019s shelves \u2014 \u201cbanning books\u201d \u2014 and racially divisive critical race theory from taxpayer-funded curricula \u2014 \u201ccurriculums that teach about racism\u201d).\n\n\u201cThe effort started with a smattering of Republican lawmakers advancing legislation focused on transgender girls\u2019 participation in school sports,\u201d the authors write.\n\nWhile the whole piece is so blatantly dishonest that it belongs on a trash heap rather than dissected and amplified with a retort, this main argument \u2014 that the transgender culture war started with Republicans \u2014 is gaining steam on the left and must be confronted.\n\nHere\u2019s an unsurprisingly unamusing \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d segment out the same day featuring Molly Kearney, introduced as \u201c\u2018SNL\u2019s\u2019 first nonbinary cast member,\u201d who floated in like a woke and unfunny female reincarnation of Chris Farley.\n\n\u201cThere are now over 14 states that have passed bills restricting health care for trans kids,\u201d said \u201cWeekend Update\u201d host Michael Che, teeing up the segment.\n\n\u201cListen to that, Michael. Restricting health care for kids. For some reason, there\u2019s something about the word \u2018trans\u2019 that makes people forget the word\u2019 kids.\u2019 If you don\u2019t care about trans kids\u2019 lives, it means you don\u2019t care about frickin\u2019 kids\u2019 lives,\u201d responded Kearney robotically to audience \u201cclapter.\u201d Kearney went on to imply it\u2019s GOP lawmakers who are trying to interfere with kids just being kids.\n\nDid you catch that? Republicans are the ones \u201crestricting\u201d trans folks and interfering with childhood innocence. The message from \u201cSNL\u201d and NYT is the same: In the midst of a cultural vacuum, conservatives fired the first shot.\n\nMake no mistake, this is the left\u2019s strategy in the frontier of sexual deviance: Push the radical envelope until conservatives enter the fray, and then pretend those conservatives conjured up a cultural rift out of thin air and executed an unprovoked sneak attack.\n\nThis exact strategy played out over the Nashville shooting. Recall that just weeks ago, a transgender-identified shooter blasted her way into a Christian school and murdered three 9-year-old children and three staff members in cold blood. How did the media respond? Not with reflection on how gender dysphoria converges with other mental health issues. No introspection on how mutilating young men or pumping young women full of testosterone might contribute to erratic aggression. There was no talk of the shooter\u2019s manifesto nor the fact that law enforcement characterized the murder of these Christians as a \u201ctargeted attack.\u201d\n\nInstead, the media focused on how \u201cDrag shows and gender-affirming care for minors were banned in Tennessee,\u201d hanging the responsibility on Republican lawmakers. Premier newspapers left the words \u201cChristian,\u201d \u201ctransgender,\u201d and \u201ctargeted\u201d out of their unsensational headlines. NBC News had the gall to make transgender-identified people the primary victims: \u201cFear pervades Tennessee\u2019s trans community amid focus on Nashville shooter\u2019s gender identity.\u201d The Biden administration declared a \u201cTrans Day of Visibility\u201d to stand up to the hate-mongering conservatives who allegedly want to \u201cerase\u201d trans people. It was gaslighting at its finest and sent the same unified message about conservatives being the real villains.\n\n[RELATED: Fixed It For You: Here\u2019s What The Vilest Headlines About The Nashville School Shooting Should Have Said] \n\nSo it\u2019s par for the course when corporate media propagandists declare \u201cthe religious right went searching\u201d for the transgender culture war post-Obergefell, no matter how absurd the claim. Yes, because it\u2019s totally believable that conservatives were fine with amputating healthy genitals before 2015, but overnight they galvanized against sexual appendage choppery. Good work, New York Times.\n\nBut understand the bigger picture. With the propaganda press, it\u2019s all about narrative building and memory holing. The trans culture war must be pinned on Republicans because it can\u2019t be pinned on municipal employees who usher drag queens into children\u2019s libraries and local pride parades. Or male athletes such as Lia Thomas, who force biological females to see their privates in women\u2019s locker rooms and then blow them out of the water with superior lung capacity, wingspan, and bone density. Or Jazz Jennings and other authors of pro-confusion children\u2019s books. Or corporate \u201cequity\u201d initiatives that inject mentally ill cross-dressers into advertising and branding for every item Americans consume. Or taxpayer-funded educators and educrats who brainwashed a generation of college grads with radical gender theory that trickled down directly into K-12 classrooms and curricula.\n\nIt can\u2019t be the fault of leftist politicians such as the incumbent president, who seized on confused kids to garner votes and normalize so-called \u201ctrans youth.\u201d Or Planned Parenthood and other leftist behemoths that identified a goldmine in wrong-sex hormones and pivoted to experimenting on kids for profit. Or alleged medical professionals who tout a \u201cconsensus\u201d on wrongly named \u201cgender-affirming care\u201d that\u2019s really just handed down from trans-motivated ideologues at the World Professional Association for Transgender Health. Or same-sex adoptive parents who fail to model healthy sex distinctions by denying children their God-given right to a mother and father.
