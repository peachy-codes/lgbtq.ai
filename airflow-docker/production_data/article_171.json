This series is exploring some of the cruelty experienced by people who have interacted with the \u201ccyber-sect\u201d of radical gender ideology, through testimony in their own words.\n\nAbout 20 percent of Generation Z is likely to identify on the \u201cLGBTQQIP2SAA\u201d spectrum, and \u201cLGBTQIA+\u201d identification overall has become much more common in the United States in the past decade, according to 2022 polling by Gallup. Over five percent of Americans from 18 to 30-years-old identify as \u201ctransgender\u201d or \u201cnonbinary,\u201d according a Pew Research Center survey published in June.\n\nThe number of diagnoses of \u201cgender dysphoria\u201d of children between the ages of 6\u201317 in the United States has surged over recent years, from 15,172 in 2017 to 24,847 in 2020, to 42,167 in 2021, according to data published by Reuters. In 2017, there were 1,905 children in the same age range, 6\u201317, undergoing hormone therapy, spiking to 4,231 in 2021.\n\nDespite dubious data surrounding the practice of \u201cgender-affirming care,\u201d especially for adolescents, the United States is the \u201cmost permissive country\u201d for child sex change operations and gender \u201ctransition\u201d drug treatments compared with any European country, according to a study by Do No Harm. Doctors who recently spoke to Breitbart News, requesting their identities be concealed for fear of backlash, said there is a \u201cperverse\u201d monetary incentive structure built around pushing \u201ctransgender\u201d drugs and surgeries on kids. The United States sex-reassignment surgery market was valued at almost two billion dollars in 2021 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 11.23 percent until 2030, according to a market report by Grand View Research.\n\n\u201cLooking for an escape\u201d\n\u201cOftentimes, people are looking for an escape. There\u2019s a lot of escapism in my generation, and this is especially true with the trans ideology,\u201d Estella Suarez-Hamilton, a young woman who \u201ctransitioned\u201d as a teenager and presented herself as a man, told Breitbart News. \u201cIt was a distraction that I needed, to not look at the parts of my life and the relationships in my life that I was not succeeding in, and were falling apart.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was looking for escape \u2014 and the political, kind of spiritual, aspects of trans ideology, when they\u2019re combined with the online [community], that offers a type of escapism,\u201d she continued. \u201cA lot of times people will say that it\u2019s a \u2018cult,\u2019 and in a way, that could be applied, but I think a more accurate term is a \u2018cyber sect\u2019.\u201d\n\nEstella called herself \u201cPhillip\u201d and took testosterone injections over a period of over seven years before realizing her emotional ills could not be healed by changing her hormonal composition and physical appearance. Estella was recommended for hormone therapy at the age of 18 by a counselor who identifies as \u201ctransgender.\u201d Her mother was deployed with the U.S. Air Force at the time.\n\nShe is now in early menopause at the age of 27, despite having stopped taking testosterone a year ago.\n\nEstella views the transgender movement as a pseudo-spiritual belief system she describes as \u201cmodern Gnosticism,\u201d which includes initiation, rituals, and rules.\n\n\u201cIf you are thinking about how to describe the sect, it is very much connected to, like, the modern Gnostic principles. This is a syncretic cyber sect of modern Gnosticism,\u201d Estella said, \u201cand I love how complicated it sounds, because the trans community loves language, and they love to complicate language to the nth degree. So, I think that this term is just very \u2014 from my experience \u2014 very accurate to explain what I went through, that\u2019s what I think happened, and that\u2019s how I can articulate it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe trans community has this stupid line, \u2018When you become trans you become your authentic self.\u2019 It\u2019s actually the complete opposite,\u201d Pamela Garfield-Jaeger, licensed clinical social worker (LCSW), told Breitbart News. \u201cYou\u2019re actually becoming somebody else, you\u2019re actually, in a way, killing off, or getting out of touch with your authentic self, and you\u2019re now becoming this almost fake identity.\u201d\n\nGarfield-Jaeger \u2014 a licensed social worker in the Bay Area who practiced for 20 years after being educated at New York University and a \u201clifelong Democrat\u201d \u2014 spoke to Breitbart News after becoming wise to what she calls a movement of \u201cdestruction of humankind,\u201d as trans ideology relies on \u201cdissociating people from their body, destroying their ability to procreate, and destroying the nuclear family.\u201d She is not currently practicing, instead focusing her efforts on speaking out about the harmful effects of transgenderism and writing a curriculum for parents to find \u201cnon-indoctrinating mental health care.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe reason I think it has such parallels to a cult is because it finds the vulnerable people, divides them from the people who care about them, then provides this kind of faux-community. That feels really good, and feels really loving, and feels like you\u2019re part of something, but it\u2019s not. It\u2019s superficial and ends up being not genuine,\u201d Garfield-Jaeger told Breitbart News.\n\n\u201cThen they\u2019re sort of policing each other\u2019s language. They can\u2019t really be themselves \u2014 they call it \u2018authentic self,\u2019 but they\u2019re really being this kind of other version, this new version of themselves. You can\u2019t break the rules. As soon as you break the rules, even just a little bit, you\u2019re out,\u201d she continued, describing how former members of the \u201ccommunity\u201d get death threats and in some cases require security after they publicly speak out about negative experiences in their \u201ctransition.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like they don\u2019t want the people who are out there speaking the truth to, like, crack this spell,\u201d she said. \u201cReally what it feels like is people are under this sort of spell. A lot of them will say that that they were under a spell. I always ask them, \u2018What could someone have said or done?\u2019 And they usually say they don\u2019t have a good answer for it.\u201d\n\n\u201cLanguage is part of their rituals, part of the initiation is understanding the terms,\u201d Estella told Breitbart News. \u201cIt\u2019s so alien, it\u2019s another type of language. \u2026 That\u2019s a lot of where they get their power from \u2014 in the Gnostic principles. It\u2019s like you have this otherworldly knowledge \u2026 You have this deep understanding of the world, and yourself, and your soul, that no one can fully understand unless they also, you know, have the Gnosis.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn the surface level, it\u2019s pro-self-actualization, pro-sex, pro-feminine, antiestablishment, but when you investigate deeper \u2026 it\u2019s a patriarchal spiritual movement, and the female aspects, and the pro-sex aspects, are like accessories used to justify their claims of equality,\u201d she continued.\n\nEstella was ejected from the \u201ccommunity\u201d when she expressed trepidation about having a double mastectomy and questioned why a \u201ctrans-man\u201d cannot have breasts. At that point, after being on testosterone for a number of years, she was blocked from online trans forums and prevented from posting and engaging.\n\n\u201cI was not given coherent informed consent\u201d\nAfter being absorbed into the \u201ccyber-sect,\u201d the \u201ctransition\u201d process of taking cross-sex hormones involves a litany of side effects. A woman taking testosterone will experience changes in the form of her body, shrinking hips and thighs, muscle growth, facial and body hair, cracking voice, increased sex drive. But then there are other, less predictable side effects, which, according to Estella, are mostly glazed over in the process of \u201cinformed consent.\u201d\n\nShe told Breitbart News, \u201cI was not given coherent informed consent,\u201d explaining that side effects were told in terms of effects on men taking testosterone, not women, and that other side effects she experienced were not mentioned at all. She speculates this is because they are just not investigated. Estella said that when she expressed having negative side effects, she was dismissed, saying, \u201cIf I say, \u2018I have experienced this, this is something that it caused me,\u2019 they\u2019ll be like, \u2018Well, it just didn\u2019t work out for you, that was your body.'\u201d\n\nAccording to Abigail Shrier\u2019s book on the transgender movement\u2019s effect on teenage girls, Irreversible Damage, testosterone will be administered based on \u201cdesired physical appearance \u2014 rather than the alleviation of physical illness \u2014 it is guided by aesthetic principles, not medical ones.\u201d\n\nShrier writes:\n\nTestosterone is typically justified as a treatment for \u2018gender dysphoria,\u2019 but the endocrinologists who administer it rarely seem even to be evaluating its progress with the patient\u2019s dysphoria. What they examine instead are blood levels to ensure that testosterone stays within normal range for a man. This seems to place endocrinologists (and just as often, nurse practitioners) in the position of hair stylists, who aim to satisfy, rather than medical professionals who seek to cure.\n\nAlthough alleviation of gender dysphoria was supposed to be its justification, doctors administering [testosterone] very often seem less interested in treating \u2018gender dysphoria\u2019 than in giving trans-identified patients the look they want.\n\nThis reporting reflects Estella\u2019s experience with hormone treatment.\n\n\u201cThere are expected changes, you know, your voice, and your clitoris grows, and there is a sex drive increase, muscles, you know, all the lovely\u2026 They give you all these beautiful changes that will happen, and then they kind of like whisper the shitty stuff that happens,\u201d Estella told Breitbart News.\n\n\u201cWhat I went through incrementally was weakened bladder, disruption of my pH, which was recurring infections, insomnia \u2014 they say insomnia, but they don\u2019t explain where the insomnia comes from, and it\u2019s from excruciating heat flashes that were like itching pins and needles on my skin, and that was every single night \u2014 and that creates mental health problems, the highs and lows of hormones, and that causes strains on relationships \u2014 that\u2019s all not addressed,\u201d she continued. \u201cYou don\u2019t cry when you\u2019re on testosterone \u2014 that\u2019s a weird side effect that is not investigated \u2014 it\u2019s very hard to feel those \u2026 feminine emotions.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was always allowed to do whatever I wanted with my hormones, like, my doctors gave me a suggested amount, but they never were like, \u2018Don\u2019t do this.\u2019 If I was like, \u2018I want to go on a higher dose,\u2019 they were like, \u2018Okay.\u2019 \u2018I want to go to lower dose,\u2019 \u2018Okay, we\u2019ll just take your blood and look at it\u2019,\u201d Estella explained.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no standard,\u201d she continued. \u201cTheir job is to make your hormones match the testosterone levels of a boy the same height and weight as you, which is, to me, that\u2019s the most pseudo-scientific thing. I don\u2019t have testicles or semen, why would I need that much testosterone, that\u2019s the amount of testosterone needed to maintain semen and testicles, all those things, and I don\u2019t have that system, so why would I be given that amount, to match those levels?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe standardization of this prescription, prescribed transition, I think that if the doctors were going to go by \u2018Do no harm,\u2019 if they were going to go by that and work by that, there would be no justification to prescribing hormones and surgery to this idea of gender dysphoria, which is very much \u2026 a consciousness issue. It\u2019s a spiritual issue, your soul is in the wrong body,\u201d Estella said.\n\n\u201cRescue fantasy\u201d\nGarfield-Jaeger explained that health professionals and educators engage in an \u201cemotionally abusive relationship\u201d with vulnerable young people by engaging in an experimental treatment of promoting and \u201caffirming\u201d transgenderism as a solution to any number of maladaptive feelings and behaviors.\n\nShe said the \u201ctransition\u201d process has an initial, temporary period of \u201ceuphoria,\u201d creating positive reinforcement, despite professionals acting out \u201ca rescue fantasy\u201d of administering treatment that has not been demonstrated to be helpful or effective.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand it, in terms of from the professional side, how they can believe in this,\u201d Garfield-Jaeger told Breitbart. \u201cI understand how a person can be tricked to believe in it if they\u2019re told, \u2018All of your pain and suffering will go away if you take this, almost, magic pill,\u2019 which is become transgender, and then you get all this positive reinforcement.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is a sort of honeymoon phase where you do end up having this\u2026 they call it euphoria, what they feel is euphoria. Sometimes it\u2019s even physical, because the hormones actually will, especially with testosterone, will give you a high, so it\u2019s almost like taking a drug that gives you a high at the beginning for quite a while for them,\u201d she explained.\n\n\u201cAnd then you also get, like, love-bombed by this community,\u201d Garfield-Jaeger went on. \u201cIf you\u2019re on a social media, you often get a whole bunch of new likes and followers and a whole bunch of, like, social status from becoming transgender. So now if you\u2019re someone who felt very invisible in your life, you maybe were autistic, or were struggling socially in some way, or feeling alone, or feeling emotionally neglected, maybe your family was going through something, maybe your parents are going through a divorce, or for whatever reason, people weren\u2019t there for you, even if they were there for you, you didn\u2019t feel they were there for you, and now you\u2019ve got these people who are saying that you\u2019re the greatest thing on earth because you\u2019re transgender, you almost get worshipped.\u201d\n\nShe said that \u201cnaive\u201d mental health providers, though, are acting out of codependence, as they do not \u201caffirm\u201d any number of other maladaptive behaviors, such as drug addiction or eating disorders.\n\n\u201cWhat I don\u2019t understand \u2026 is how professionals are able to believe that this is the right thing to do,\u201d she said. \u201cI understand there are people who are silenced. I understand there are people who are fearful, and there are people that are maybe avoiding the topic so that they can continue to have some kind of livelihood, but I\u2019m still having trouble understanding the people who truly are believers in this, who aren\u2019t evil; I believe that [there] are just naive people who think they\u2019re doing the right thing because this is about acceptance and love, and I think they\u2019re riding out some kind of rescue fantasy \u2026 I think it\u2019s giving helpers this feeling that they\u2019re helping and they have this desire to help, and there\u2019s almost a codependence happening.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost like an emotionally abusive relationship, like \u2018Mommy Dearest\u2019,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you look at other disorders \u2014 of course now they don\u2019t want to call it a disorder, they compare it more to an immutable characteristic, but we know that\u2019s not the case because people are choosing to do it \u2014 if you look at other mental health issues, like an eating disorder, or drug addiction, you don\u2019t have institutions being, like, \u2018Well you need to affirm their addiction,\u2019 \u2018We need to affirm their eating disorder.'\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is very much like, I would say, negligence. Just people who maybe are well meaning and doing things that are irresponsible, just because they thought, \u2018Oh, well, this is the expected thing, the cool thing,\u201d Estella told Breitbart News of those who treated her in her \u201ctransition.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can look at myself objectively and see that I was \u2026 an 18-year-old \u2026 a young adult, who was already going through way too much, like, had too much on her shoulders. So I\u2019ll forgive myself for making big girl decisions when I did not, you know, have the capacity to deal with the big girl consequences,\u201d Estella said, reflecting on her experience.\n\n\u201cI have so much love for the people who are still in this sect, because I can see them, I do see them, and I see the pain, and I remember.\u201d",

What they examine instead are blood levels to ensure that testosterone stays within normal range for a man. This seems to place endocrinologists (and just as often, nurse practitioners) in the position of hair stylists, who aim to satisfy, rather than medical professionals who seek to cure.\n\nAlthough alleviation of gender dysphoria was supposed to be its justification, doctors administering [testosterone] very often seem less interested in treating \u2018gender dysphoria\u2019 than in giving trans-identified patients the look they want.\n\nThis reporting reflects Estella\u2019s experience with hormone treatment.\n\n\u201cThere are expected changes, you know, your voice, and your clitoris grows, and there is a sex drive increase, muscles, you know, all the lovely\u2026 They give you all these beautiful changes that will happen, and then they kind of like whisper the shitty stuff that happens,\u201d Estella told Breitbart News.\n\n\u201cWhat I went through incrementally was weakened bladder, disruption of my pH, which was recurring infections, insomnia \u2014 they say insomnia, but they don\u2019t explain where the insomnia comes from, and it\u2019s from excruciating heat flashes that were like itching pins and needles on my skin, and that was every single night \u2014 and that creates mental health problems, the highs and lows of hormones, and that causes strains on relationships \u2014 that\u2019s all not addressed,\u201d she continued. \u201cYou don\u2019t cry when you\u2019re on testosterone \u2014 that\u2019s a weird side effect that is not investigated \u2014 it\u2019s very hard to feel those \u2026 feminine emotions.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was always allowed to do whatever I wanted with my hormones, like, my doctors gave me a suggested amount, but they never were like, \u2018Don\u2019t do this.\u2019 If I was like, \u2018I want to go on a higher dose,\u2019 they were like, \u2018Okay.\u2019 \u2018I want to go to lower dose,\u2019 \u2018Okay, we\u2019ll just take your blood and look at it\u2019,\u201d Estella explained.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no standard,\u201d she continued. \u201cTheir job is to make your hormones match the testosterone levels of a boy the same height and weight as you, which is, to me, that\u2019s the most pseudo-scientific thing. I don\u2019t have testicles or semen, why would I need that much testosterone, that\u2019s the amount of testosterone needed to maintain semen and testicles, all those things, and I don\u2019t have that system, so why would I be given that amount, to match those levels?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe standardization of this prescription, prescribed transition, I think that if the doctors were going to go by \u2018Do no harm,\u2019 if they were going to go by that and work by that, there would be no justification to prescribing hormones and surgery to this idea of gender dysphoria, which is very much \u2026 a consciousness issue. It\u2019s a spiritual issue, your soul is in the wrong body,\u201d Estella said.\n\n\u201cRescue fantasy\u201d\nGarfield-Jaeger explained that health professionals and educators engage in an \u201cemotionally abusive relationship\u201d with vulnerable young people by engaging in an experimental treatment of promoting and \u201caffirming\u201d transgenderism as a solution to any number of maladaptive feelings and behaviors.\n\nShe said the \u201ctransition\u201d process has an initial, temporary period of \u201ceuphoria,\u201d creating positive reinforcement, despite professionals acting out \u201ca rescue fantasy\u201d of administering treatment that has not been demonstrated to be helpful or effective.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand it, in terms of from the professional side, how they can believe in this,\u201d Garfield-Jaeger told Breitbart. \u201cI understand how a person can be tricked to believe in it if they\u2019re told, \u2018All of your pain and suffering will go away if you take this, almost, magic pill,\u2019 which is become transgender, and then you get all this positive reinforcement.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is a sort of honeymoon phase where you do end up having this\u2026 they call it euphoria, what they feel is euphoria. Sometimes it\u2019s even physical, because the hormones actually will, especially with testosterone, will give you a high, so it\u2019s almost like taking a drug that gives you a high at the beginning for quite a while for them,\u201d she explained.\n\n\u201cAnd then you also get, like, love-bombed by this community,\u201d Garfield-Jaeger went on. \u201cIf you\u2019re on a social media, you often get a whole bunch of new likes and followers and a whole bunch of, like, social status from becoming transgender. So now if you\u2019re someone who felt very invisible in your life, you maybe were autistic, or were struggling socially in some way, or feeling alone, or feeling emotionally neglected, maybe your family was going through something, maybe your parents are going through a divorce, or for whatever reason, people weren\u2019t there for you, even if they were there for you, you didn\u2019t feel they were there for you, and now you\u2019ve got these people who are saying that you\u2019re the greatest thing on earth because you\u2019re transgender, you almost get worshipped.\u201d\n\nShe said that \u201cnaive\u201d mental health providers, though, are acting out of codependence, as they do not \u201caffirm\u201d any number of other maladaptive behaviors, such as drug addiction or eating disorders.\n\n\u201cWhat I don\u2019t understand \u2026 is how professionals are able to believe that this is the right thing to do,\u201d she said. \u201cI understand there are people who are silenced. I understand there are people who are fearful, and there are people that are maybe avoiding the topic so that they can continue to have some kind of livelihood, but I\u2019m still having trouble understanding the people who truly are believers in this, who aren\u2019t evil; I believe that [there] are just naive people who think they\u2019re doing the right thing because this is about acceptance and love, and I think they\u2019re riding out some kind of rescue fantasy \u2026 I think it\u2019s giving helpers this feeling that they\u2019re helping and they have this desire to help, and there\u2019s almost a codependence happening.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost like an emotionally abusive relationship, like \u2018Mommy Dearest\u2019,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you look at other disorders \u2014 of course now they don\u2019t want to call it a disorder, they compare it more to an immutable characteristic, but we know that\u2019s not the case because people are choosing to do it \u2014 if you look at other mental health issues, like an eating disorder, or drug addiction, you don\u2019t have institutions being, like, \u2018Well you need to affirm their addiction,\u2019 \u2018We need to affirm their eating disorder.'\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is very much like, I would say, negligence. Just people who maybe are well meaning and doing things that are irresponsible, just because they thought, \u2018Oh, well, this is the expected thing, the cool thing,\u201d Estella told Breitbart News of those who treated her in her \u201ctransition.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can look at myself objectively and see that I was \u2026 an 18-year-old \u2026 a young adult, who was already going through way too much, like, had too much on her shoulders. So I\u2019ll forgive myself for making big girl decisions when I did not, you know, have the capacity to deal with the big girl consequences,\u201d Estella said, reflecting on her experience.\n\n\u201cI have so much love for the people who are still in this sect, because I can see them, I do see them, and I see the pain, and I remember.\u201d",
