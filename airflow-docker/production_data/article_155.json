  "content": "Attorney General Pam Bondi has ordered the Department of Justice (DOJ) to review a case of New Hampshire parents being blocked from protesting transgender athletes.\n\nBondi on Wednesday announced on X that she has asked the DOJ\u2019s Civil Rights Division to \u201cexamine\u201d the case, after a federal judge on Monday barred the parents from wearing pink wristbands that say \u201cXX\u201d in reference to female sex chromosomes. \n\n\u201cI have asked my Civil Rights Division to examine this matter. This DOJ stands with women and their supportive parents,\u201d Bondi said in response to a post from women\u2019s sports advocate Riley Gaines about the case. \n\nIn September, several parents wore pink wristbands with \u201cXX\u201d on them as a sign of protest during a girls\u2019 high school soccer game where trans-identifying male athlete Parker Tirrell, now 16, was playing on the other team.\n\nBow and Dunbarton School Districts Superintendent Marcy Kelley responded to the wristbands by issuing a notice of trespass against the parents, including Antony and Nicole Foote, Kyle Fellers, and Eldon Rash, according to local media reports. The no-trespass order has since expired. \n\nThe parents subsequently sued the school district, alleging that their First Amendment rights had been violated and asking the judge to allow them to carry signs and wear wristbands featuring \u201cXX\u201d at school events while the case is ongoing.\n\nU.S. District Court Judge Steven McAuliffe, a President George H. W. Bush appointee, ultimately sided with the school district and said it acted reasonably in preventing parents from protesting.  \n\n\u201cWhile plaintiffs may very well have never intended to communicate a demeaning or harassing message directed at Parker Tirrell or any other transgender students, the symbols and posters they displayed were fully capable of conveying such a message,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAnd, that broader messaging is what the school authorities reasonably understood and appropriately tried to prevent.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe broader and more demeaning/harassing message the School District understood plaintiffs\u2019 \u2018XX\u2019 symbols to convey was, in context, entirely reasonable,\u201d he continued. \n\nA senior attorney for the Institute for Free Speech, one of the attorneys representing the parents, said he disagrees with the court\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cThis was adult speech in a limited public forum, which enjoys greater First Amendment protection than student speech in the classroom,\u201d attorney Del Kolde said in a statement. \u201cBow School District officials were obviously discriminating based on viewpoint because they perceived the XX wristbands to be \u2018trans-exclusionary\u2019.\u201d\n\nPlaintiffs filed a notice following the ruling saying they do not plan to enter more evidence before the judge issues a final decision, according to the report. \n\nPresident Donald Trump notably signed an executive order on \u201cKeeping Men out of Women\u2019s Sports\u201d which seeks protect female student athletes from having \u201cto compete with or against or having to appear unclothed before males.\u201d The order also mandates each federal department \u201creview grants to education programs and, where appropriate, rescind funding to programs that fail to comply with the policy established in this order,\u201d which protects women \u201cas a matter of safety, fairness, dignity, and truth.\u201d",
