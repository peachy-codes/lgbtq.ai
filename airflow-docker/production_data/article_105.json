The Trump Administration has erased trans people from the stonewall national monument website\u2026 we will not allow Trump and his hatemongers to redefine our communities or our history!\u201d\n\nThe rally lasted for over an hour and was hosted by Jay W. Walker, a co-founder of the Reclaim Pride Coalition. The lineup included a diverse array of speakers from the community.\n\nErik Bottcher, NYC City Council Member for District 3 and a relentless advocate for LGBTQ people, addressed the crowd: \u201cWe are here to send a message to Donald Trump: We will not let you erase the existence of our trans siblings. We will not let you cleave our community apart and divide us. We are one community. And now is the time for gays and lesbians and cisgender members of our community to stand up against what is happening. \u2026 We will win, because we always win in the end.\u201d \n\nDr. Carla Smith, the CEO of the New York City LGBTQ Community Center, located just a few minutes\u2019 walk from the historic site, also spoke at the rally and emphasized that our community can always access www.StonewallForever.org \u2013 a digital archive for all to see and know our history that will never go away. She said in part: \u201cOur history exists with our trans siblings having ALWAYS led the way. That cannot be erased.\u201d\n\nState Senator Brad Holyman, also a longtime advocate for the local LGBTQ community in New York City, spoke similarly on the importance of retaining our stories. \u201cWe need to make sure transgender history remains American history,\u201d he said in his remarks.\n\nAngelica Christina, trans activist and board member of the Stonewall Gives Back Initiative, gave a moving speech reminding us of tireless trans leaders who have been in this fight before, like Sylvia Rivera and Marsha P. Johnson; and urging support for transgender, nonbinary, and intersex Americans. \u201cTrans people have always been at the forefront and on the frontlines,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing play out in real time by this administration \u2026 is criminalizing trans people for existing and decriminalizing the real criminals like Donald Trump.\u201d She called on the National Park Service to immediately restore the accurate website language. \u201cTrans people exist. We are not going anywhere. We will continue to fight for our rights, so the legacy of our transcestors will remain in the universe. Silence is complicity. \u2026 We will not go back. I see you. We uplift you, we love you, we will fight for you.\u201d\n\nCathy Marino Thomas, a grassroots activist during the fight for the freedom to marry and now a board member of Gilbert Baker Foundation, inspired the crowd by reminding us of Baker\u2019s words when he created the original Pride flag in 1987. \u201cThe rainbow is a symbol of harmony, and if we eliminate any color from the rainbow flag, we destroy the integrity of the rainbow. So too, with the family of man. If we eliminate any one group, or gender, or race, or anyone for whatever reason, we destroy the integrity of the family of man.\u201d\n\nThe crowd regularly burst out into cheers and chants: \u201cWhat do we want? Justice! When do we want it? Now!\u201d \u201cWhen trans lives are under attack, what do we do? Stand up, fight back!\u201d Activists like Marti Gould Cummings, a board member of Equality New York, urged Democrats in Washington, DC to use their platform to take bolder action. \u201cIt is because of our trans elders that we are here,\u201d they said. \u201cThis legislation removing trans people from a park is a distraction. We are here to tell trans kids that they are worth it; that they deserve to grow into trans adults \u2026 We cannot have another Nex Benedict,\u201d they said, referring to the trans and indigenous teenager from Oklahoma who died after being assaulted in a school restroom and lacking any support from Oklahoma\u2019s conservative leadership or superintendent of public schools.\n\nJason Rosenberg of the Gender Liberation Movement led the crowd in a chant: \u201cDemocrats, have a spine; trans lives are on the line.\u201d\n\nStacy Lentz, the co-owner of the Stonewall Inn bar across the street from the monument and the CEO of the Stonewall Gives Back Initiative, immediately blasted the Trump administration for its actions shortly after the news broke.\n\n\u201cThis blatant act of erasure not only distorts the truth of our history, but it also dishonors the immense contributions of transgender individuals \u2014 especially transgender women of color \u2014 who were at the forefront of the Stonewall Riots and the broader fight for LGBTQ+ rights,\u201d she said in a statement.\n\n\u201cLet us be clear: Stonewall is transgender history. Marsha P. Johnson, Sylvia Rivera, and countless other trans and gender-nonconforming individuals fought bravely, and often at great personal risk, to push back against oppressive systems. Their courage, sacrifice, and leadership were central to the resistance we now celebrate as the foundation of the modern LGBTQ+ rights movement.\u201d\n\nThe Stonewall Inn bar is the site of the 1969 riots that launched the LGBTQ+ rights movement. Stonewall National Monument is the first U.S. national monument dedicated to LGBTQ+ rights and history. President Barack Obama designated it as a national monument on June 24, 2016 during LGBTQ+ Pride month.\n\nIn addition, the Stonewall National Monument Visitors Center, an independent and queer owned non-profit venue located across the street from the Stonewall National Monument \u2013 owned by Pride Live and unaffiliated with the monument or National Park Service \u2013 slammed the change by the Trump administration to the agency\u2019s website:\n\n\u201cPride Live is a non-profit organization founded on the principle of advancing the fight for full LGBTQIA+ equality. Through the creation of the Stonewall National Monument Visitor Center, we\u2019re unwavering in our effort to protect and preserve Stonewall\u2019s legacy and history. Our space is inextricably linked with and honors the brave pioneers, especially transgender and gender-nonconforming individuals, who led the Stonewall Rebellion. \n\nThe anti-LGBTQ action from the National Park Service is the latest in a list of anti-LGBTQ actions from the Trump Administration. On his first day in office, he signed an executive order targeting LGBTQ Americans around what he described as \u201cgender ideology extremism.\u201d\n\nThe opening text of the Stonewall National Monument website used to read: \u201cBefore the 1960s, almost everything about living openly as a lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or queer (LGBTQ+) person was illegal. The Stonewall Uprising on June 28, 1969 is a milestone in the quest for LGBTQ+ civil rights and provided momentum for a movement.\u201d What used to be correctly listed as LGBTQ+ was changed to \u2018LGB\u2019. \u201cTransgender or queer\u201d were removed along with the \u201cTQ+\u201d part of the LGBTQ+ acronym from the opening text as well as a link to a resource on \u2018LGBTQ+ flags.\u2019\n\nTo stay up to date on GLAAD\u2019s coverage of rallies and resistance across the country to anti-LGBTQ actions, make sure to follow us on social media @GLAAD and check back regularly!",
