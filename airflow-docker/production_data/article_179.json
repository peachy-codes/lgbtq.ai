And again, to tell kids, it doesn\u2019t always have to be and isn\u2019t always the default setting, but that\u2019s a different mentality than they put in the minds of kids, and that\u2019s why this debate goes on.\u201d\n\nHe said that people were fed up with being told that they were bigots if they wanted to even debate the topic.\n\n\u201cAnd the fact that you think, or a lot of people on the Left think, that even if you just have this debate, it makes you a bigot, you just have to roll over \u2026 that was their position,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you even question this, you\u2019re some sort of a bigot. And this is new science. And it has to do with children. And it\u2019s not going to look good in the future, that position.\u201d",
