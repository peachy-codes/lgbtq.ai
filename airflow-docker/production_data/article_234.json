Gavin Newsom signed the new Assembly Bill 1955, which allows schools to refrain from notifying parents of their child\u2019s sexuality or gender identity. Musk explained his decision on the move, leading to Peterson questioning him on why he was willing to make \u201cgender affirming care\u201d an \u201cissue.\u201d (RELATED: Elon Musk Says SpaceX Headquarters Is Moving Out Of California After New LGBT Law)\n\n\u201cIt happened to one of my older boys, where I was essentially tricked into signing documents for one of my older boys, Xavier. This was before I really had any understanding of what was going on. We had COVID going on,\u201d Musk said. \u201cI was told Xavier might commit suicide.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat was a lie right from the outset,\u201d Peterson responded. \u201cNo reliable clinician ever believed that. There was never any evidence for that, and also if there\u2019s a higher suicide rate, the reason is because the underlying depression and anxiety, not because of the gender dysphoria. And every goddamn clinician knows that.\u201d\n\nPeterson continued to call out clinicians, stating he couldn\u2019t \u201cimagine anything worse\u201d for a parent.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s incredibly evil, and I agree with you that the people promoting this should go to prison,\u201d Musk said.\n\n\u201cSo I was tricked into doing this. It wasn\u2019t explained to me that puberty blockers are actually just sterilization drugs,\u201d Musk continued. \u201cSo I lost my son essentially. They call it dead naming for a reason. The reason it\u2019s called dead naming is because your son is dead. So my son Xavier is dead, killed by the woke mind virus.\u201d\n\nMusk had first discussed his son\u2019s transition at 16 years old last year in a biography by Walter Isaacson, explaining how Xavier had first texted Musk\u2019s brother about the transition, asking not to relay the information to the billionaire, according to the book. While Musk first responded to the change in a mostly positive manner, Xavier had cut off his father after he became a communist.\n\nSince the incident, Musk has called out California\u2019s policies around sex-change procedures and medication for minors and blamed his child\u2019s ideology on the progressive Los Angeles school, Crossroads, which Xavier attended at the time.\n\nFollowing Newsom\u2019s approval of AB 1955 last week, Musk called the action his \u201clast straw\u201d in a statement on X and accused California of passing several laws \u201cattacking both families and companies.\u201d",
