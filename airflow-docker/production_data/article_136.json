  "content": "USA Fencing says it is standing by its decision to disqualify a cisgender fencer who forfeited a tournament match against a transgender opponent last week, an act the organization says violated international competition rules.\n\nOn March 30, USA Fencing (the country\u2019s governing body for youth and adult competitive fencing) oversaw the annual Cherry Blossom tournament at the University of Maryland. During the Division 1 Women\u2019s Foil event, cis fencer Stephanie Turner knelt in front of her opponent Redmond Sullivan, removed her protective mask, and refused to begin the match. A referee then showed Turner a black card to disqualify her.\n\nA black card is the harshest penalty in fencing, one that is usually deployed in cases of egregious unsportsmanlike conduct. In a statement to the Irish Star this week, USA Fencing said that Turner\u2019s conduct violated rules for competition set by the International Fencing Federation (FIE).\n\n\u201c[Turner\u2019s] disqualification was not related to any personal statement but was merely the direct result of her decision to decline to fence an eligible opponent, which the FIE rules clearly prohibit,\u201d USA Fencing\u2019s statement read in part. FIE\u2019s Technical Rules bar athletes from competing if they \u201crefuse to fence against any other fencer whatsoever [...] correctly entered in the event.\u201d\n\n\u201cUSA Fencing is obligated to follow the letter of those rules and ensure that participants respect the standards set at the international level,\u201d the organization\u2019s statement continued. \u201cWe remain committed to inclusivity within our sport while also upholding every requirement dictated by our governing body.\u201d\n\nUSA Fencing also told the Star that it will \u201calways err on the side of inclusion,\u201d but that its leaders \u201crespect the viewpoints on all sides\u201d and would consider changing their trans and nonbinary athlete policy should Olympic policies change or new \u201crelevant evidence-based research\u201d be conducted. The organization\u2019s current policy allows adult trans and nonbinary people to compete in men\u2019s or women\u2019s divisions depending on their stated gender identity, with restrictions based on an athlete\u2019s testosterone levels; trans women must complete a year of testosterone suppression to be eligible for women\u2019s competition, while trans men who take testosterone are automatically disqualified from women\u2019s events.\n\nSullivan went on to finish 24th overall in the field of 39 competitors (including Turner), with seasoned competitor Shuang Li picking up the fifth gold medal of her career. Of course, Li received no accolades from right-wing media outlets, much less self-proclaimed defender of women\u2019s sports J.K. Rowling, who focused on denigrating Sullivan and uplifting Turner on Elon Musk\u2019s X social media platform. Rowling wrote in one post that Turner is \u201cwhat a heroine looks like,\u201d after sharing another post from former tennis star turned anti-trans campaigner Martina Navratilova, who said she was \u201cfuming\u201d and shamed USA Fencing for \u201cthrow[ing] women under the gender bullshit bus.\u201d\n\nCurrent scientific research has not shown that trans women hold significant biological advantages over cis women in competitive sports. In fact, a study backed by the International Olympic Committee last year found that trans women who suppress their testosterone may face significant disadvantages in some athletic metrics like vertical leap. But conservatives in the U.S. have insisted that it is \u201ccommon sense\u201d to ban trans women and girls from women\u2019s sports, which has now become a rallying cry for the second Trump administration, as officials use trans athletes as a cudgel to withhold funding from states like Maine by claiming they are violating federal civil rights law.\n\nIn 2022, the NCAA tightened restrictions on trans athletes\u2019 eligibility following the success of then-college swimmer Lia Thomas. NCAA president Charlie Baker said in February that the organization would voluntarily shift its policies to align with Trump\u2019s executive order calling for sports to be separated based on the president\u2019s definition of \u201cbiological sex.\u201d The new participation policy specifically states that a \u201cstudent-athlete assigned male at birth may not compete for an NCAA women's team.\u201d It\u2019s not clear based on USA Fencing\u2019s statement this week whether the organization will alter its own policy to match the NCAA updates.",
