  "content": "The purveyors of child sexual mutilation are worried. Those fighting against medically \u201ctransitioning\u201d children have won a lot in the last year, and the transgender lobby is responding by lying even more. For example, a recent piece by Meredithe McNamara of the Yale School of Medicine purports to debunk \u201can inescapable swirl of disinformation that targets trans youth.\u201d McNamara offers \u201cfive things you need to know to combat the vast majority of anti-trans talking points.\u201d\n\nBut it is her claims that are false, often obviously so.\n\nThis dishonesty begins with her first claim, which is that \u201cSo-called \u2018social contagion\u2019 is not real and it does not make people trans.\u201d She focuses her critique on Lisa Littman\u2019s study describing the phenomenon of rapid-onset gender dysphoria. The research McNamara cites in response is terrible, but this is beside the point because transgender identities are obviously socially contagious \u2014 no one needs social science reports to see this. After all, if transgenderism is a \u201cnatural state of being\u201d resulting from \u201cgenetics and the brain\u2019s structural development\u201d then why can\u2019t we diagnose transgender identities via genetic markers or MRI rather than subjective self-evaluation, and why has transgender identification suddenly increased exponentially?\n\nThe usual excuse is that this enormous increase in transgender identities is the result of a more affirmative and accepting society \u2014 trans people were always here in these numbers but are only just now coming out. However, this claim destroys the suicide narrative that powers the transgender movement, which is that trans-identified people will kill themselves if they are not affirmed and medically transitioned on demand. After all, if current levels of youth trans identification are natural, where were all the suicides in the past, when there would have been far more unaffirmed and un-transitioned \u201ctrans kids\u201d?\n\nTransgender ideology does not have a good answer for this, nor for other difficulties, such as why adolescent girls are suddenly claiming to be transgender in disproportionate numbers. Despite the protests of McNamara and others, social contagion is by far the best explanation for the transgender phenomenon. \n\nMcNamara\u2019s next assertion is that \u201cTrans youth are not rushed through gender-affirming treatment.\u201d She claims to rebut \u201cwild misrepresentations of standard care, like the idea that \u2018double mastectomies on 12-year-old girls\u2019 is a common occurrence, or that gender-affirming care means kids being castrated. This all sounds too absurd to believe. And that\u2019s because it\u2019s not true.\u201d \n\nYet she admits that double mastectomies for 12-year-olds are being done in the name of \u201cgender-affirming care\u201d \u2014 she just claims they are not \u201ccommon.\u201d With regard to castration, she is obviously lying, for that is literally what was done to reality TV star Jazz Jennings, the most famous \u201ctrans kid\u201d in America. Jennings was subjected to the intervention plan known as the Dutch Protocol \u2014 puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones, and genital surgery \u2014 and that meant castration, first chemical, then surgical.\n\nThis illuminates McNamara\u2019s two-step: It\u2019s not happening, but when it does, it is carefully done and medically necessary. Both parts of this are false. Some children are being rushed into so-called medical transition, and it is never medically necessary to \u201ctransition\u201d a child. Thus, she retreats into appeals to authority, such as citing WPATH (World Professional Association for Transgender Health). But this is not a respectable authority. Rather, it is an activist group that has declared \u201ceunuch\u201d to be a valid identity to be affirmed, a decision it reached by relying on online forums filled with child sexual abuse fantasies. \n\nMcNamara\u2019s third point is that \u201cPuberty blockers, hormones, and medical treatments for gender dysphoria are not \u2018experimental.\u2019\u201d She asserts \u201cthat study after study establishes the benefits of gender-affirming care, which include increased body satisfaction, improved social functioning, hope for the future, and lower rates of depression, eating disorders, self-injury, and suicide.\u201d But the very studies she cites disprove her claims.\n\nShe links to two studies, one of which is an infamous report from earlier this year that was a disaster for the transgender movement. As I observed in The Federalist, two of the 315 subjects in the study died by suicide \u2014 not a positive result for a regimen that is justified as self-harm prevention. Moreover, males involved in the study didn\u2019t show any improvement in \u201cdepression and anxiety scores\u201d or \u201cscores for life satisfaction.\u201d Simply put, if pumping trans-identified males full of female hormones fails to improve their mental health, there\u2019s no reason to continue giving them those hormones.\n\nHowever, these devastating results were ignored to focus on some minor, self-reported mental health improvements among females given testosterone, even though these may have been due to cherry-picking data on the part of the research team. As this example shows, the research cited in support of wrongly named \u201cgender-affirming care\u201d is often low-quality as well as conducted by the same people whose livelihoods and reputations depend upon vindicating \u201cgender-affirming care.\u201d Nonetheless, the transgender lobby and its allies boost it anyway in the hopes that no one will bother to check it.\n\nWhen the research is rigorously examined, the flaws are quickly apparent, which is why multiple European nations have recently restricted so-called transition for children. Contrary to McNamara\u2019s claim, they have declared it to be experimental.\n\nMcNamara\u2019s fourth point is that \u201cUsing medications \u2018off-label\u2019 is neither uncommon nor unsafe.\u201d This is a half-truth, that in this context is a full lie. Yes, some off-label uses of medication are safe, but as she admits, using puberty blockers in response to gender dysphoria is not among them. She acknowledges that there are side effects (specifically, loss of bone density, though there are others) and so she shifts from arguing that they are safe to arguing that they are worth the risks. \n\nBut the risks are all on one side. There is no physical danger from allowing normal, natural puberty. This is why trans activists always have to play the suicide card \u2014 the only harm that will befall them is self-harm.\n\nMcNamara\u2019s final assertion is that \u201cIt is exceedingly rare that people regret getting gender-affirming care.\u201d To support this claim, she suggests that the significant rates of desistance (up to 30.8 percent) found in a recent study using data from the military health care system is \u201clikely a reflection of the challenging health systems that young adults depend on.\u201d Her argument is that people discontinue supposedly life-saving care because they just can\u2019t figure out how to renew a prescription or make a doctor\u2019s appointment. It is easier for her to blame the health care system than to admit that maybe, just maybe, people regret being rushed into \u201caffirmations\u201d and radical, life-altering procedures.\n\nMcNamara also relies on a flawed 2021 study that, among other problems, pooled data from a set of studies in which less than 20 percent of the studies used ranked as good or having a low risk of bias. This illustrates the common tactic used by transgender activists and their allies, which is to pile weak research together to make it appear more substantial. But more bad data is just more bad data.\n\nNonetheless, we should expect more of this junk science and lies as transgender activists scramble to support their enthusiasm for maiming children. They have no choice but to lie and distort data because their fundamental position \u2014 that children are somehow being born into the wrong bodies, which therefore require radical alteration to resemble the other sex \u2014 is a ridiculous superstition.
