  "content": "A federal judge ruled this week that a Massachusetts school district can ban parents who wear \u201cdisruptive\u201d clothing to school events \u2014 including two dads who wore pink wristbands to protest biological males competing in girls\u2019 sports.\n\nAccording to a report from the Boston Globe, a federal judge denied the request of two fathers, John Doyle and Mark Callahan, for a preliminary injunction against Middleborough Public Schools. The two claimed the school district\u2019s ban violated their First Amendment rights.\n\nThe two men had worn pink wristbands with the letters \u201cXX\u201d to several school events, which they said was intended to silently protest the district\u2019s policy allowing transgender students \u2014 particularly biological males \u2014 to compete in girls\u2019 athletics. School administrators claimed the wristbands made some students feel \u201cunsafe\u201d and disrupted the school environment.\n\nIn his ruling, the judge said that public schools are not \u201ctraditional public forums,\u201d and that schools have a greater ability to limit certain kinds of expression \u2014 particularly if they can justify those limitations as a way to maintain a safe and productive learning environment.\n\nThe judge wrote that \u201cschool officials are well within their rights to prohibit expressions that they reasonably forecast would cause disruption.\u201d\n\nThe fathers had also voiced their concerns at school board meetings, and the court did not prevent them from continuing to do so. The decision only upheld the school\u2019s ban on wearing the wristbands during events held on school property.\n\nSupporters of the ruling say it reinforces the idea that schools should protect transgender students from targeted harassment and ensure safe spaces.\n\nCritics argue the decision limits free speech and silences dissent about policies they view as harmful to female athletes.",
