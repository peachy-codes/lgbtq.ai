It is a fight we carry forward, generation after generation.\n\nLiving in Alabama, I\u2019m aware that every right we enjoy was won by the people\u2014not simply granted by lawmakers. Black elders in Montgomery remind us that the Montgomery Bus Boycott wasn\u2019t just a symbolic protest\u2014it was 381 days of relentless organizing, sacrifice, and resistance. These histories are blueprints for our movements today, and we need them now more than ever.\n\nAs a volunteer for Montgomery Pride United, I have witnessed how the LGBTQ movement is sustained by elders who survived bar crackdowns, led revolutionary marches, and endured the HIV/AIDS crisis. And now, we\u2019re seeing the state of Alabama work to intentionally suppress this crucial history.\n\nOn the federal level, under the current Administration, LGBTQ people are facing an aggressive, coordinated effort to censor our stories and restrict equal access to public life. Currently,  456 anti-LGBTQ bills have been introduced across the United States. Here\u2019s what is at stake in Alabama:\n\nHouse Bill 4 introduces the vague term \u201cgender-oriented conduct\u201d into the state obscenity law\u2014an intentional tactic to ban books about queer and trans people from public libraries.\nHouse Bill 67 is a drag ban also designed to target and criminalize innocent trans people for simply existing in schools or libraries.\nHouse Bill 244 expands \u201cDon\u2019t Say Gay\u201d through 12th grade, further isolating queer and trans youth while censoring free speech, LGBTQ history, and the contributions of queer and trans leaders from classrooms.\nHouse Bill 246, the \u201cPronoun Bill,\u201d would prohibit public school, college, and university employees from using a student\u2019s name or pronouns without explicit written parental permission.\nThe inaccurate and harmful act ignoring the existence of intersex, transgender, and nonbinary people , was recently signed by Governor Ivey. It enshrines medically inaccurate definitions of \u201cmale\u201d and \u201cfemale\u201dand aims to block people from their own accurate identity documents and justifies bathroom restrictions that are vague and dangerously enforced. This bill takes effect on October 1.\nAnti-LGBTQ bills have emboldened extremists on the ground in Alabama.\n\nThese bills are not just targeting LGBTQ people, they are a direct attack on First Amendment freedoms. When Alabama lawmakers passed an anti-DEI law last year, a Black Student Union was forced to give up its meeting space, excluding Black students from necessary and safe places to find community. These actions are part of a broader strategy to roll back civil rights and silence those who challenge systemic oppression. In 2023, lawmakers threatened the Alabama Department of Archives and History\u2019s budget for inviting Invisible Histories, a community archive organization, to present a lecture on Alabama\u2019s rich, and too often untold, LGBTQ History. Since 2024, we have seen an increase in challenged and banned books across public libraries \u2013 including The Pronoun Book, The Meaning of Pride, The Hate U Give, and Being You: a First Conversation about Gender. Our local LGBTQ community center, managed by Montgomery Pride United, has also heard from many queer teens that they fear repercussions by teachers and students alike for being themselves. This onslaught of oppressive laws is meant to make life harder for queer and transgender people in the state.\n\nBut here\u2019s what lawmakers fail to understand: LGBTQ people are not leaving Alabama. No amount of hateful legislation will erase us. We are active in our communities, schools, churches, and in every facet of public life across the state. Our history is our power. And right now, lawmakers are not just trying to ban books\u2014they are trying to deny we exist online and in real life. You can help ensure this never happens by joining the collective effort to preserve LGBTQ histories, both digitally and physically, by signing up with Invisible Histories, a community-based archive working with LGBTQ organizations across the South to protect the legacy of LGBTQ Alabamians and help safeguard the online records of DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) programs set to be eliminated because of the President\u2019s executive order. We\u2019ve survived attacks against LGBTQ people before, and this time, we have the tools to protect our history. Our elders were battle-tested, building movements from the ground up and laying the foundation for the social progress we no longer can take for granted. It is our turn to ensure their wisdom and resilience are imparted to future generations. LGBTQ Alabamians shouldn\u2019t have to leave home to thrive, and those intent on making life intolerable for the most marginalized in our state should never be in the majority.\n\n\n\n",
