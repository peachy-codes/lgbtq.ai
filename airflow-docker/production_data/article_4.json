  "content": "GREENVILLE, S.C. \u2013 Local library patrons, with help from the American Civil Liberties Union and ACLU of South Carolina, are suing officials in South Carolina\u2019s most populous county for systematically purging literature by and about lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) people from its public library collection.\n\nThe lawsuit asks a federal court to permanently block Greenville County\u2019s policies and practices that have deliberately hidden or removed dozens of books that positively portray transgender and gender-nonconforming people. The ACLU and the ACLU of South Carolina filed the lawsuit today in the U.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina on behalf of families and residents of Greenville County, arguing that county officials have violated library patrons\u2019 First and Fourteenth Amendment rights.\n\n\"Books are one of our greatest tools to learn about other peoples, the world around us, and more importantly to learn about ourselves through representation,\u201d said Greg Rogers, a Greenville County parent and plaintiff in the lawsuit. \u201cAll children and young adults should have equal access to these tools. Keeping even one child from accessing the representation they provide is a travesty for the equality of all children.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor years, the library board has tried to censor patrons' access to diverse stories,\u201d said Stephen Shelato, co-founder of Freedom in Libraries Advocacy Group (FLAG), a vibrant local library group that has lobbied hard against anti-LGBTQ discrimination at the Greenville Library. \u201cLocal parents believe that exposure to diverse stories is healthy and developmentally appropriate, but board members have repeatedly chosen instead to follow the demands of a loud minority of activists and partisan groups. Local parents are now courageously speaking out and taking action\u2014and they deserve the full support of our community.\"\n\n\u201cGreenville County cannot censor our public libraries merely because its officials find certain materials politically, morally, or religiously objectionable,\u201d said Allen Chaney, Legal Director for the ACLU of South Carolina. \u201cAfter years of public advocacy against these discriminatory actions, we must now rely on the courts to vindicate a simple truth: the constitution protects everyone, including LGBTQ people.\u201d\n\n\u201cGreenville County\u2019s policy is a blatant infringement on the rights we all share to learn, read, and speak as we please,\u201d said Shana Knizhnik, Senior Staff Attorney for the ACLU\u2019s Jon L. Stryker and Slobodan Randjelovi\u0107 LGBTQ & HIV Project. \u201cDecades of First Amendment precedent protects the freedom of readers and community members like our plaintiffs, and nobody\u2019s story is unacceptable simply because of who they are or who they love. Across the country, communities like Greenville are standing up and fighting back against efforts to push LGBTQ people from public life, and we\u2019re hopeful the court will see through these discriminatory acts of censorship.\u201d\n\nNew policies adopted by the Greenville County Library Board in 2024 require that all materials with \u201cillustrations, themes, or story lines [that] affirm, portray, or discuss changing the appearance of a minor\u2019s gender in ways inconsistent with the minor\u2019s biological sex\u201d or with \u201cillustrations, themes, or storylines that celebrate, portray, or affirm gender transitioning\u201d must be removed from the juvenile and young adult sections of the library. The library system has moved these books to adults-only sections of the library, limiting access for young readers.\n\nMeanwhile, the library system has completely removed dozens of titles that positively portray LGBTQ people, including in adult sections of the library. As today\u2019s court filing explains, the library system\u2019s leadership has granted more than 50 requests from the Greenville County Republican Women\u2019s Club to remove LGBTQ materials, while disproportionately refusing other patrons\u2019 requests to order new LGBTQ materials.\n\nPlaintiffs in the lawsuit identify specific books that have been removed from the Juvenile section. Amber Galea, parent of two children, says her children are interested in books that have been moved out of the Juvenile section, including Hocus and Pocus and the Spell for Home by A.R. Capetta, The Cardboard Kingdom by Chad Sell, Riding Freedom by Pam Mu\u00f1oz Ryan, and Snapdragon by Kat Leyh.\n\nThe following are other examples of books that the library has moved out of juvenile and young adult sections:\n\nJuli\u00e1n is a Mermaid by Jessica Love (an award-winning children\u2019s picture book about a young boy who wishes to dress up like a mermaid)\nAna on the Edge by A.J. Sass (an award-winning book about a 12-year-old nonbinary figure skater)\nRed: A Crayon\u2019s Story by Michael Hall (a picture book about a blue crayon that was mistakenly labeled as \u201cred\u201d)\nA list of 59 books that were removed entirely from the Greenville County library system in 2023 is available here.\n\nThe complaint filed today can be found here.\n\nThe Greenville County Library Board members who promoted anti-transgender collection policies in 2024 did not try to keep their discriminatory motives a secret. According to those board members\u2019 public comments, library materials condoning gender fluidity are \u201ctrash\u201d and the \u201cidea\u201d of \u201ctransgenderism\u201d is a \u201cdangerous thing.\u201d As one library board member put it: \u201c[T]he presence of a transgender character in a book \u2026 is grounds for relocating it to the adult section.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile library board members and officials have ordered Pride Month displays to be taken down, ordered library staff to remove advertising for an LGBTQ book club, and encouraged librarians to use the \u201cweeding\u201d process \u2014 meant to remove books that are outdated or in physical disrepair \u2014 as a pretext to throw out LGBTQ titles, including books purchased within the past five years.\n\nThese actions by library board members and library administrators have contributed to an ongoing \u201cculture of fear,\u201d as highlighted in an October 2023 Greenville News article.
