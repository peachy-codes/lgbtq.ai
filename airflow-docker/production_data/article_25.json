The Justice Department is asking the court to order the state to direct all schools to prohibit the participation of males in athletic competition designated for females.\n\n\nMaine officials have refused to agree with a settlement that would have banned transgender students from sports, arguing that the law does not prevent schools from letting transgender athletes participate. Mills said Wednesday that the lawsuit was expected and is part of a pressure campaign by Washington to force Maine to ignore its own human rights laws. \u201cThis matter has never been about school sports or the protection of women and girls, as has been claimed, it is about states rights and defending the rule of law against a federal government bent on imposing its will, instead of upholding the law,\u201d Mills said in a statement.\n\nMaine\u2019s attorney general, Aaron Frey, said Wednesday he is confident Maine is acting in accordance with state and federal law.\n\n\u201cOur position is further bolstered by the complete lack of any legal citation supporting the Administration\u2019s position in its own complaint,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cWhile the President issued an executive order that reflects his own interpretation of the law, anyone with the most basic understanding of American civics understands the president does not create law nor interpret law. \u201d\n\nThe government\u2019s complaint cites as examples the case of a transgender athlete who in February won first place in pole vault at a Maine indoor track and field meet and a transgender athlete who last year began competing in female cross country races in the state and placed first in a girl\u2019s 5K run. The lawsuit reflects a stark philosophical turnabout from the position on gender identity issues taken during Democratic administrations.\n\nUnder President Joe Biden, the government tried to extend civil rights policies to protect transgender people. In 2016, the Justice Department, then led by Attorney General Loretta Lynch, sued North Carolina over a law that required transgender people to use public restrooms and showers that corresponded the gender on their birth certificate.\n\nTrump signed an executive order in February, \u201cKeeping Men Out of Women\u2019s Sports,\u201d that gave federal agencies wide latitude to ensure entities that receive federal funding abide by Title IX in alignment with his administration\u2019s interpretation of \u201csex\u201d as the gender someone was assigned at birth.\n\nBondi was joined at the news conference by former University of Kentucky swimmer Riley Gaines, who has emerged as a public face of the opposition to transgender athletes. Gaines tied with a transgender athlete for fifth place in a 2022 NCAA championship and has testified before lawmakers across the country on the issue. She and others frame the issue as women\u2019s rights. During a February meeting with governors, Trump threatened to pull federal funding from Maine if the state did not comply with his executive order. Mills responded: \u201cWe\u2019ll see you in court.\u201d\n\nMaine sued the administration this month after the Department of Agriculture said it was pausing some money for the state\u2019s educational programs because of what the administration contended was Maine\u2019s failure to comply with the Title IX law. A federal judge on Friday ordered the administration to unfreeze funds intended for a Maine child nutrition program.\n\nQuestions over the rights of transgender people have become a major political issue in the past five years.\n\nTwenty-six states have laws or policies barring transgender girls from girls school sports. GOP-controlled states have also been banning gender-affirming health care for transgender minors and restricting bathroom use in schools and sometimes other public buildings.\n\n",
