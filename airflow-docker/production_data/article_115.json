  "content": "The first two months of Donald Trump\u2019s second term have revealed a dramatic misalignment between the goal of the President to relentlessly attack transgender people, and the needs and wishes of American people, including addressing the overwhelming prices of groceries and the dramatic decline in financial markets and overall health of the economy.\n\nFor his first major speech to the American people on March 6, 2025, GLAAD tracked Trump\u2019s references to transgender people compared to the economy. Trump\u2019s Address to Congress included 1,500 words targeting LGBTQ people (for a duration of eight minutes), and the remarks appeared near the top of his historically long speech, at the 15-minute mark. By contrast, Trump\u2019s focus on jobs and affordability came in at 975 words. A mere nine seconds comprised the subject of jobs, specifically forcing federal workers back to the office. \n\nTrump\u2019s discrimination and disinformation comes at the expense of attention on the issues voters care most about. Gallup polling shows 90% of 2024 voters identified the economy as extremely or very important. \n\nMarkets have lost $4 trillion since Trump took office, yet he has signed five executive orders specifically targeting transgender people\u2019s identities, health care, education, and transgender people serving in the military, as well as three more orders targeting diversity, equity, and inclusion, with threats to defund educational institutions and nonprofit organizations. Ten percent of all Trump executive orders signed so far have targeted LGBTQ Americans and all others from marginalized backgrounds, at every American\u2019s expense. \n\nGLAAD\u2019s Trump Tracker has tracked 17 anti-LGBTQ moves by the President and his administration since inauguration on January 20, 2025. GLAAD Trump Tracker has noted every anti-LGBTQ action Trump has taken, including during his first term and prior. \n\nTariffs and anti-trans application of federal resources have doubly affected Maine. Tariff concerns have already affected local industries with deep ties to Canada. A 25% tariff imposed on Canadian goods by Trump will cost ratepayers between $8\u201310 million a year, including a 5% jump in electricity bills on average. At the same time, after a high profile confrontation between President Trump and Gov. Janet Mills, six federal agencies swarmed the state to investigate transgender students in school sports. Only two transgender girls are competing this school year, according to the Maine Principals\u2019 Association. The response was an excessive and inordinate expenditure of resources.
