  "content": "Democrats are starting to have serious conversations around how to handle transgender rights politically ahead of next year\u2019s elections \u2014 after, by their own admission, they were caught flat-footed on the issue in 2024.\nThe upshot, so far: Don\u2019t be so dogmatic that you risk alienating voters and allies.\n\nRep. Sarah McBride, the first openly trans member of Congress, and her staff have spoken to her Democratic colleagues about the topic, NOTUS has learned. The Delaware congresswoman has cautioned moderate Democrats that the tenor and tone of their comments \u2014 particularly on questioning trans athletes in sports, which is where most of the debate has focused \u2014 might inflame and splinter factions instead of being productive.\n\n\u201cWe have to create more space in our tent. If, for instance, we want to have a majoritarian coalition \u2014 not just electorally, but specifically on issues around trans rights \u2014 that, by necessity, is going to have to include people who have a range of thoughts,\u201d McBride told NOTUS.\n\n\u201cA binary choice between being all-on or all-off is not constructive for anyone,\u201d McBride continued. \u201cIt impedes the very needed path toward winning electorally, winning hearts and minds and, most importantly, winning progress.\u201d\n\nRepublicans have already clearly signaled their plans to lean on trans issues in next year\u2019s campaigns, after their success in 2024. President Donald Trump said last week that he has directed his party to not bring up trans issues \u201cbecause there is no election right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut about a week before the election, bring it up because you can\u2019t lose,\u201d he told reporters from the Oval Office.\n\nThe Pew Research Center found that Americans\u2019 support for restrictions on trans people increased between 2022 and 2025. For example, 58% of survey respondents in 2022 said they supported requiring trans athletes to compete in sports that \u201cmatch the sex they were assigned at birth.\u201d That increased to 66% in 2025.\n\nIn 2022, 46% of respondents supported making it illegal for health providers to offer gender-affirming care to trans minors. That number rose to 56% in 2025.\n\nSome members \u2014 like Reps. Seth Moulton and Tom Suozzi, both of whom have recently met with McBride \u2014 received immediate intraparty backlash for publicly saying they oppose having trans athletes participate in women\u2019s and girls\u2019 sports. McBride thinks that type of response is unproductive.\n\n\u201cI think it is an incredibly problematic instinct that many have to excommunicate people who aren\u2019t in lockstep with you on every policy, or even aren\u2019t in lockstep with you on the messaging,\u201d she said.\n\nMcBride is by no means the only House member who has been ruminating on the topic.\n\nRep. Greg Landsman, whose district was targeted by House Republicans\u2019 campaign arm, which opposed his support for trans rights, told NOTUS that Democrats are having \u201cvery informal\u201d conversations on the topic.\n\nThey look like, \u201cyou pull somebody aside and you just say, \u2018What do you think?\u2019 or \u2018This is what I\u2019m hearing\u2019 \u2014 how Americans talk. We\u2019re not enacting legislation like [Republicans] are that is intended to just be mean as fuck and it\u2019s not solving problems,\u201d Landsman said.\n\n\u201cI do think there is, on the positive side, a growing appreciation that Democrats could be a little judgy and annoying about this, and maybe we should be open-minded and appreciate that not everyone is where we are,\u201d he continued.\n\nThe conversations were particularly prevalent in January, when the House voted on a bill to ban trans athletes from participating in sports teams of their preferred gender. The bill passed with only three Democrats defecting from the rest of the party. One of those votes came from Rep. Vicente Gonzalez.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had some people be critical of my vote, but I think the vast majority of people in my district agree with me, and I think the vast majority of people around the country do too,\u201d Gonzalez told NOTUS.\n\nThe South Texas congressman said he \u201cspoke to especially front-line battleground members. I told everybody what vote I was going to take before I took it.\u201d Ultimately, only Reps. Henry Cuellar and Don Davis \u2014 to whom Gonzalez confirmed he spoke with beforehand \u2014 joined him in separating from the rest of the caucus. (Cuellar and Gonzalez voted in support, Davis voted present).\n\nHad House Democratic leadership not whipped against the bill (NOTUS viewed the notice sent to congressional offices at the time), Gonzalez said, \u201cI think you would have seen 20 or 30 members vote with us.\u201d\n\nGonzalez told NOTUS that he spoke with caucus leaders, although declined to name who, to demand that leadership not whip future bills that had to do with trans issues. (In response to this, a spokesperson for House Minority Whip Katherine Clark told NOTUS in a statement, \u201cWe don\u2019t disclose conversations with Members regarding our whip strategy.\u201d)\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t agree with whipping those types of votes,\u201d Gonzalez said. \u201cI think everyone should vote their conscience, their ideology, the values of their district, and that\u2019s how we win races.\u201d\n\nClark said in a statement that the \u201cRepublican strategy is to divide Americans instead of bringing the country together around solutions.\u201d\n\nHouse Democrats\u2019 most common messaging strategy on trans issues, advised by McBride after the election, has been to treat Republicans\u2019 anti-trans attacks as a distraction and to pivot to other issues.\n\nMoulton has also been making an effort to ensure the caucus is more receptive to nuanced opinions around trans issues.\n\nIn January, Moulton spoke separately with Rep. Mark Takano, chair of the Congressional Equality Caucus, and Rep. Becca Balint, co-chair of the caucus, about ensuring that the caucus is open to different opinions on trans issues, according to two sources familiar.\n\nBoth lawmakers, one of the sources said, were receptive to Mouton\u2019s stance.\n\nTakano told NOTUS in a statement that a \u201ccritical\u201d part about being Equality Caucus chair is his \u201ccommitment to creating spaces where every Member of Congress can have their genuine questions listened to and answered, without judgment.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe recognize that there is more work to do to win some of the hearts and minds of the general public, given people\u2019s lack of familiarity with the trans community and the prevalence of right-wing anti-trans propaganda and disinformation, and we are working to make sure members have the information and support they need to be that bridge,\u201d Takano added.\n\nSimilarly, Balint said in a statement that \u201cit\u2019s critical to have hard conversations around this, both inside and outside of Congress.\u201d\n\nIn an interview, Moulton told NOTUS that Democrats needed to borrow a page from Republicans\u2019 playbook.\n\nCalifornia's Democratic governor was once considered an LGBTQ+ ally. So, what\u2019s with the heel turn?\n\u201cRepublicans clearly don\u2019t agree on everything, but they\u2019ve succeeded in recent years in broadening their tent so that whether you\u2019re a MAGA Trumper or a much more traditional Republican, you can still get behind the party and they\u2019re not being kicked out,\u201d he said.\n\nThe congressman added, though, that he believes there\u2019s no room within the Democratic Party for views that completely oppose trans rights.\n\n\u201cThat crosses the line of civil rights,\u201d Moulton said.\n\nMoulton, who confirmed that he has spoken with McBride about trans issues, was optimistic about the informal conversations taking place within the caucus. But he added that there haven\u2019t been any broader conversations brought by leadership around how to handle trans issues \u201cbecause people are still scared to have them.\u201d\n\nBut with a broader discussion now taking place among the American public, some Democrats are attempting to slowly start one within the party.\n\n\u201cI do think I understand, as a trans person, how to meet people who aren\u2019t trans where they are, and how to find commonality with people,\u201d McBride said. \u201cPart of that is creating room for a lack of understanding, for disagreement, for grace and, therefore, to create room for growth.\u201d",
