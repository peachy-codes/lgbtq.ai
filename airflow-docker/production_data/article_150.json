  "content": "During an interview with Fox 9 Minneapolis-St. Paul on Tuesday, Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison (D) discussed the state\u2019s lawsuit over the Trump administration\u2019s attempts to keep biological men from competing in women\u2019s sports and stated that \u201cthe Trump administration is literally making a massive deal out of a very small number of children who are trying to play sports.\u201d And also that \u201cwe cannot compromise on people\u2019s basic human rights.\u201d Ellison also stated that \u201cwe are talking about kids as young as 5 and 6 years old. We\u2019re talking about kids 11, 12. People want to emphasize some 18, 19-year-old kid or somebody else. No, we\u2019re talking about junior high and lower kids, often.\u201d\n\nEllison said, \u201c[W]e\u2019re always open to a conversation, but we cannot compromise on people\u2019s basic human rights. That we cannot compromise on. As long as the Trump administration is willing to work something out that protects the rights of Minnesota kids, yeah, we\u2019re open to a dialogue.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201c[W]e are talking about a very small number of people. I\u2019m not sure we even have more than ten. I think we probably have about that or maybe even fewer. And then when you divide them into trans boys or trans girls, you\u2019re even talking about a smaller number, still. So, I think that it is important to understand that our society and the Trump administration is literally making a massive deal out of a very small number of children who are trying to play sports. \u2026 And we are talking about kids as young as 5 and 6 years old. We\u2019re talking about kids 11, 12. People want to emphasize some 18, 19-year-old kid or somebody else. No, we\u2019re talking about junior high and lower kids, often. And so, I ask kids keep \u2014 I ask people to keep that in mind too.\u201d\n\nLater, in response to a question on public opinion on trans athletes, Ellison said that he is following the law and \u201cdo we really want people\u2019s constitutional rights to be a matter of polling, right? I guarantee you that, in 1961, if you were to do a poll on whether or not we should get rid of Jim Crow, that poll might not have [come] out the way we would have hoped it would in 2025. And I can tell you that, when Martin Luther King died, he was actually pretty unpopular.\u201d\n\nEllison further stated that if he could talk to President Trump, \u201cI\u2019d try to help him understand that transgender folks have some of the highest incidents of depression, anxiety, and even suicide, are often bullied, are often beat up. And being a part of youth sports is something that helps give them some sense of belonging and a sense of confidence.\u201d\n\nEllison also said that he hasn\u2019t seen any proof from the Trump administration of women\u2019s rights being violated, but \u201cI can prove the number of transgender people who have been attacked, who\u2019ve been even murdered and killed and people\u2026who suffer great mental and emotional peril because of their exclusion and isolation in our society.\u201d",
