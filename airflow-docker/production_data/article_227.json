  "content": "There\u2019s a celebrity trend that has nothing to do with the season\u2019s hottest fashion designer, jewelry item or flashy car. Instead, Hollywood stars are parading their transgender children around like some sort of good luck charms on a keychain.\n\nActresses like Megan Fox, Jennifer Lopez and Charlize Theron have been posing for photos next to their transgender or \u201cnon-binary\u201d kids, sending a message that this is somehow the new definition of cool. Fox specifically has styled her three boys in very obviously feminine ways, something that Northwestern University Psychologist Dr. Michael Bailey called \u201ckind of crazy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that our society now is kind of crazy, and that is, you know, that\u2019s an example, I guess, of how we\u2019re crazy, and I think that\u2019s really bad for our society. I don\u2019t know why anybody would think that\u2019s a good idea,\u201d Bailey told the Daily Caller.\n\nFox has openly discussed her support of her alleged non-binary child Noah, a son she shares with ex-husband Brian Austin Green. Noah has been photographed wearing dresses when he was as young as age five. The \u201cTransformers\u201d actress insisted that he made that fashion choice himself but has also admitted to encouraging Noah to form a unique identity. Fox says Noah started wearing dresses at age two, according to People.\n\n\u201cWhen I became pregnant with Noah, I could feel, through my mother\u2019s intuition I suppose, that he was not subscribing to gender stereotypes, so I decided to provide an environment for him early on that would allow him to discover how he wanted to express himself,\u201d she said in a 2019 interview with Education and Career News.\n\nNoah apparently gets bullied at school, but Fox told Glamour in a 2022 interview she gave her son books that tell him it\u2019s okay to dress like a girl.\n\nThe number of American adults and children who identify as transgender is about 0.5 and 1.4 percent, respectively, according to a Williams Institute study. The odds of having a transgender child is one in 3000, according to renowned clinical psychologist and YouTube personality, Dr. Jordan Peterson.\n\nDr. Bailey told the Caller that actors aren\u2019t really known for being \u201cmentally healthy people,\u201d which perhaps can explain certain choices.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re known for being good actors and actresses, and, you know, they tend to be good looking and so on. I think that there\u2019s probably a high rate of certain kinds of problems, like personality disorders. I\u2019m not saying [Fox] has one, although this behavior certainly makes me wonder.\u201d\n\nMusic video director and former Republican congressional candidate Robbie Starbuck said in a 2023 Tweet that he used to live in the same gated community as Fox. Starbuck claimed he saw two of Fox\u2019s sons having a breakdown over their mom allegedly forcing them to wear girls clothing.\n\nFox responded angrily, writing on Instagram in part, \u201cirregardless of how desperate you may become at any given time to acquire wealth, power, success, or fame \u2013 never use children as leverage or social currency. [E]specially under malevolent and erroneous pretense.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou f\u2014ked with the wrong witch,\u201d she concluded.\n\nIn Hollywood, society and local communities, the case of transgender affirmations seem to be far more prevalent now than ever before. And there can be grave consequences to this, Bailey says.\n\n\u201cOne thing that\u2019s becoming clear is that when you socially transition the child, that\u2019s the term for letting the child live as the other sex, they are much more likely to go on and want medical transition later,\u201d he told the Caller, warning that permanent sex changes have \u201cserious side effects.\u201d\n\nDr. Bailey suggested celebrities might be showcasing their gender-bending children to gain attention, which is something that\u2019s in their nature.\n\n\u201cThe wacky ones are gonna be proud of transitioning their kids, and they\u2019re gonna want people to know about it. Another thing about celebrities is they\u2019re kind of exhibitionist \u2026 they\u2019re morally exhibitionist. They\u2019re right. They want you to know about it.\u201d\n\nAmerican author, activist and de-transitioner Walt Hayer knows first-hand how damaging this type of child-rearing can be and has written various books about the dangers of transitioning.\n\nHis grandmother clothed him in dresses when he was younger, much like Fox does with her son. Eventually, after what he calls a misdiagnosis of gender dysphoria, Hayer underwent medical and surgical procedures and lived as a transgender woman for eight years \u2014 something that affected him deeply.\n\n\u201cSo the issue that I have with it is that this happened to me personally, and it destroyed my life,\u201d Hayer told the Caller. \u201cI didn\u2019t recover from this until I was 50-years-old, and I had to go \u2014 I had to go through, you know, psychotherapy. I went through the surgical transition. I went through all of this crap.\u201d\n\nBen Affleck has a 15-year-old child with Jennifer Garner named Seraphina Rose. During Rose\u2019s grandfather\u2019s funeral in April, she stood on the podium and introduced herself as \u201cFin,\u201d suggesting she too has decided to take a more androgynous route.\n\nLopez, Affleck\u2019s current wife, introduced her then-14-year-old daughter Emme with \u201cgender-neutral\u201d pronouns (they/them) in 2022 before they performed a duet at Dodgers Stadium.\nLOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA - MAY 30: (L-R) Angelina Jolie, Vivienne Jolie-Pitt and Kristen Bell attend the opening night performance of \"Reefer Madness: The Musical\" at The Whitley on May 30, 2024 in Los Angeles, California.

(Photo by Monica Schipper/Getty Images)\n\n\u201cThey are very, very busy, booked and pricey,\u201d Lopez said, according to The Independent. \u201cThey cost me when they come out. But they\u2019re worth every single penny because they\u2019re my favorite duet partner of all time. So if you will indulge me.\u201d\n\nParents who encourage their children to identify like this are misleading them, according to Hayer.\n\n\u201cAll we\u2019re doing is devaluing, dehumanizing and destroying an entire generation of children when we engage in this practice of telling them that they\u2019re transgender. This is the one thing that really burns at me,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are no transgenders. They don\u2019t exist.\u201d\n\nThis phenomena is a social contagion, and celebrities taking these stances are doing so to become part of a group, Hayer believes.\n\n\u201cGee, I have a trans kid. I have a trans kid. We get to talk about our trans kid. It\u2019s sort of like, you know, parading your schnauzer down to the coffee shop and saying that I\u2019ve got this special dog that you don\u2019t have,\u201d he told the Caller. \u201cAnd I just really believe it\u2019s sickening what they\u2019re doing, man. I\u2019m appalled in the stuff that I suffered because of what my grandma did to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just think that the adults who are doing this to their kids really feel like somehow they joined a group of highly intellectual people that are smarter than you.\u201d\n\nFamous actress Charlize Theron has adopted two children, Jackson in 2012 and August in 2015.\n\nTheron claimed during a 2019 interview with Daily Mail that Jackson, now 11, was transgender.\n\n\u201cYes, I thought [Jackson] was a boy, too,\u201d she recalled. \u201cUntil she looked at me when she was three years old and said: \u2018I am not a boy!'\u201d\n\nHayer issued a strong warning about the damage this could potentially cause.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t realize that 30 to four years later, the kid\u2019s going to commit suicide, or he\u2019s going to be an alcoholic, which I was \u2014 I attempted suicide twice. If that\u2019s what you want for your child, then, by all means, go for it,\u201d Hayer said. \u201cThey will never be able to be boys. Won\u2019t be able to produce sperm, so they won\u2019t be able to be a father,\u201d Hayer said.\n\nTheron has defended drag shows for kids and thinks that homophobia, racism and sexism are the reasons HIV spread.\n\n\u201cWe love you, queens. We\u2019re in your corner and we\u2019ve got you,\u201d Theron said in a May 2023 video, referring to drag queens. \u201cI will fuck anybody up who\u2019s trying to fuck with anything with you guys. There are so many things that are hurting and, really, killing our kids, and we all know what I\u2019m talking about right now, and it ain\u2019t no drag queen.\u201d\n\nMore than twice as many men who said they were transgender and underwent a sex change procedure attempted suicide, as opposed to those who didn\u2019t undergo the procedure, according to a study done by the American Urological Association (AUA).\n\nForty-two percent of transgender-identifying adults have attempted suicide, 81 percent have thought about it and 56 percent have self-injured themselves non-suicidally, according to a Williams Institute study.\n\nHollywood is now, more than ever, full of stars who are affirming their children\u2019s sex changes very publicly. Today\u2019s youth are growing up in the digital age, which makes them susceptible to celebrities\u2019 influence.\n\nAngelina Jolie and Brad Pitt have a daughter named Shiloh, who is now 18. Shiloh had been toying with gender since the age of three, Jolie said in a 2010 interview with Vanity Fair.\n\n\u201cShe wants to be a boy,\u201d Jolie remarked at the time. \u201cSo we had to cut her hair. She likes to wear boy clothes. She thinks she\u2019s one of her brothers.\u201d\n\nWhile Shiloh doesn\u2019t appear to be full-on transgender, she has presented in a very masculine form throughout the years, including in pictures with her mom.\n\nHOLLYWOOD, CA \u2013 OCTOBER 20: Shiloh Jolie-Pitt, Angelina Jolie arrives at the Premiere Of Gkids\u2019 \u201cThe Breadwinner\u201d at TCL Chinese 6 Theatres on October 20, 2017 in Hollywood, California. (Photo by Steve Granitz/WireImage)\n\nNowadays, she seem to be taking a more androgynous approach.\n\nDr. Jill Simons, executive director of the American College of Pediatricians, explained to the Caller what she thinks might be fueling the transgender craze.\n\n\u201cHistorically, you know, decades ago, when you looked at those children who grew up to be adults that did have what was diagnosed as gender dysphoria, it was a very small percentage, less than one percent,\u201d she said, noting this was primarily associated with boys at the time. \u201cThat is how it had been for a long, long time, until most recently. And now we\u2019re seeing almost a reverse of this, presenting in adolescents with teenage girls. And you know, we\u2019re seeing in some communities, you know, 1,000% increase in the number of cases of children presenting with gender discord. Either something in biology changed in the last couple decades, or, this is not biologically based. This is some social contagion, or some, you know, outside influence that\u2019s causing this,\u201d Dr. Simons told the Daily Caller.\n\nTherapists and mental health professionals could be put in danger of losing their license if they don\u2019t affirm a child\u2019s identity, because not doing so could be labeled \u201cdiscrimination,\u201d according to Dr. Simons.\n\nMichigan, for instance, passed a law in July 2023 that banned so-called \u201cconversion therapy,\u201d which House Bill 4617 defines as \u201cany practice or treatment by a mental health professional that seeks to change an individual\u2019s sexual orientation or gender identity, including, but not limited to, efforts to change behavior or gender expression.\u201d\n\nBritish actress Naomi Watts (L) and daughter Kai attends the Dior pre-fall fashion show at the Brooklyn Museum in Brooklyn, New York on April 15, 2024. (Photo by Andrea RENAULT / AFP) (Photo by ANDREA RENAULT/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nTwenty-three states plus Washington, D.C., have banned what they deem \u201cconversion therapy.\u201d\n\n\u201cTherapists, mental health professionals, when they\u2019re counseling someone who is expressing concerns about, you know, their biological sex, they have been regulated and told that if they start to look for a different cause, other than, you know, this is who they are, they question that this person is not trans,\u201d Dr. Simons told the Caller, \u201cwhen they say they\u2019re not trans, then that\u2019s discriminating, and they\u2019re in threat of losing their license.\u201d\n\nSometimes a natural transition through puberty could cause doubts and fear in children, and instead of explaining and working through these matters, medical professionals are quickly labeling the children as transgender, Dr. Simons explained.\n\n\u201cInstead of us as adults and professionals, saying, you know, yeah, puberty is a little rough \u2026 You\u2019re awkward, and your body is doing things, you know, growing and out of sync. And instead of saying, \u2018Yes, that\u2019s normal to not feel great sometimes in your body,\u2019 we\u2019re telling them, \u2018Oh my gosh, there must be something wrong with you\u2019 \u2014 that is horrible and that is cruel,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cAnd so it has become a catch-all diagnosis.\u201d\n\nDr. Simons said parents are oftentimes victimized in this process as well.\n\n\u201cI feel like they\u2019re being misled, and even a stronger word, you know, being tricked by doctors saying you need to do this for your child.\u201d\n\nProfessionals are telling children, \u201cthis is the best evidence. This is the best medical care, and parents are used to trusting doctors, you know, saying, \u2018Okay, we come to you because we want to know what the best thing is.\u2019 And they want the best for their children. I believe most parents do, and so they will do anything to help their child.\u201d (RELATED: Ben Affleck\u2019s Daughter Seraphina Rose Appears To Reveal New Name At Grandad\u2019s Funeral: REPORT)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very hard as a parent to say, \u2018I don\u2019t agree with you,\u2019 let alone they may not have the right information to say \u2014 to question it. And so, you know, part of what we\u2019re doing is trying to educate not only pediatricians but parents. And I think parents are becoming more educated about, you know, really, what some of these trans affirming care treatments involve, and that they are potentially harmful. I think parents are feeling more emboldened to stand up.\u201d\n\nSimons told the Caller, however, \u201cparents may have other agendas.\u201d",

And instead of saying, \u2018Yes, that\u2019s normal to not feel great sometimes in your body,\u2019 we\u2019re telling them, \u2018Oh my gosh, there must be something wrong with you\u2019 \u2014 that is horrible and that is cruel,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cAnd so it has become a catch-all diagnosis.\u201d\n\nDr. Simons said parents are oftentimes victimized in this process as well.\n\n\u201cI feel like they\u2019re being misled, and even a stronger word, you know, being tricked by doctors saying you need to do this for your child.\u201d\n\nProfessionals are telling children, \u201cthis is the best evidence. This is the best medical care, and parents are used to trusting doctors, you know, saying, \u2018Okay, we come to you because we want to know what the best thing is.\u2019 And they want the best for their children. I believe most parents do, and so they will do anything to help their child.\u201d (RELATED: Ben Affleck\u2019s Daughter Seraphina Rose Appears To Reveal New Name At Grandad\u2019s Funeral: REPORT)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very hard as a parent to say, \u2018I don\u2019t agree with you,\u2019 let alone they may not have the right information to say \u2014 to question it. And so, you know, part of what we\u2019re doing is trying to educate not only pediatricians but parents. And I think parents are becoming more educated about, you know, really, what some of these trans affirming care treatments involve, and that they are potentially harmful. I think parents are feeling more emboldened to stand up.\u201d\n\nSimons told the Caller, however, \u201cparents may have other agendas.\u201d",
