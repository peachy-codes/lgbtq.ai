  "content": "The professional disc golf athlete who walked off the course during a Nashville competition on Friday over her concerns about a trans-identifying male player told The Daily Wire she was warned against speaking out.\n\nWhen Abigail Wilson stepped up to compete at the Disc Golf Pro Tour\u2019s Music City Open on Friday morning, she cocked her arm back to throw, but then suddenly lowered her disc, turned around, and walked away from the tee area.\n\n\u201cFemales must be protected in our division,\u201d Wilson said as she walked away. \u201cThis is unfair. I refuse to play.\u201d\n\nShe told The Daily Wire after the competition that she had raised concerns a day earlier, and was reprimanded for misgendering her competition. The trans-identifying male disc golfer, Natalie Ryan, was set to play at the same tee time as Wilson in the women\u2019s division. Ryan has sparked controversy since at least 2022 when he defeated the world\u2019s number one ranked female competitor, Kristin Tattar.\n\nWilson said this made her anxious because she had heard protests were planned against the trans-identifying player, and last year, a terrorism threat against the same player caused the Music City Open to be temporarily suspended. Wilson played in last year\u2019s event as well.\n\n\u201cThey did a terrible job of keeping us safe during the event when this threat was called in,\u201d Wilson told The Daily Wire. \u201cI said, \u2018Well, it is a very unpleasant thing that all of us women have to play with him.\u2019 After I said the word \u2018him,\u2019 this Disc Golf staff member told me that if I misgender him again, I will be penalized and removed from the tour, and he\u2019s going to pretend he didn\u2019t hear me say that.\u201d\n\nWilson said staff also assured her that the event would have police, security, and bag checks, but she saw none of that when she arrived, and she was allowed in without showing her credentials.\n\n\u201cThere were zero security precautions,\u201d she said.\n\nJeff Spring, CEO and Director of the Disc Golf Pro Tour said they did have security on site, including an on-duty police officer, plain clothes security staff, and armed security guards, and they did conduct bag checks for spectators. Wilson was \u201ccleared through our spectator entrance and recognized as an approved player upon arrival,\u201d he said.\n\nSpring also said that the Disc Golf Pro Tour \u201csupports Abigail\u2019s right to protest and have her voice heard.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no consequence for Abigail\u2019s protest today, as she violated no rules or policies,\u201d he said. \u201cWe encourage all players to do what they think is right. Abigail is welcome to compete on the same playing field as all other players and we wish her the best in her young career.\u201d\n\nWilson previously said she assumes she will no longer be welcomed to play in Disc Golf Pro Tour competitions, the highest level of disc golf, but she does not regret her decision to walk away on Friday.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t keep putting my head down,\u201d she told The Daily Wire. \u201cI like to say that I throw plastic at metal chains for a living, and it\u2019s not worth any of this. We shouldn\u2019t have to deal with this as women, as professionals.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday I most likely ended my career and that is okay because this is bigger than me,\u201d Wilson said on social media after walking off the competition.\n\n\u201cI have worked so hard to get to this point to play on the DGPT, but the sacrifice of my career and my hard work is worth it if it means I can make a difference for other women, daughters, nieces, and the future of our sport,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you feel how wrong it is to have biological males be competing in female protected divisions in sports, now is the time to speak up and stand your ground.\u201d\n\nSpring, the Disc Golf Pro Tour director said any changes to the sport\u2019s transgender participation policy will likely be derived from changes to International Olympic Committee policy and state and federal law.",
