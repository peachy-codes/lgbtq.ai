  "content": "California reproductive health care advocates are moving to extend their playbook for abortion protections to transgender care in the wake of federal funding cuts and moves to reverse trans rights under the Trump administration.\n\nIn a state legislative package first shared with POLITICO, Planned Parenthood is backing six bills that touch on access to medication abortion, STI testing, Medi-Cal funding and privacy protections for patients and providers who work in gender-affirming care. The package comes just after the Trump administration notified Planned Parenthood clinics that it\u2019s withholding tens of millions of dollars under the Title X family planning program and threatens further cuts to other state health resources. President Donald Trump has also taken aim at transgender care, threatening to cut off Medicaid funding to any facility that provides it, especially to minors.\n\n\nPlanned Parenthood now sees an opening to try to protect gender-affirming care in California, similar to how the state moved to enshrine abortion rights under the first Trump administration.\n\nSeveral of the proposals build on shield laws and privacy protections the groups first pushed for to cover abortion providers and patients in the immediate aftermath of the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade in 2022.\n\n\u201cPlain and simple, we\u2019re protecting our patients and providers,\u201d Jodi Hicks, CEO of the group\u2019s California advocacy group, told POLITICO. \u201cWe\u2019re really looking at everything that we did, what was successful when we were protecting abortion, transferring that over to ensure our trans folks are also protected.\u201d\n\nThe legislative package is being rolled out at a critical juncture for Planned Parenthood. The group is coming under threat at the macro level in Washington, where anti-abortion activists have spent the month lobbying Congress to defund the organization; and at the micro level in Sacramento where social conservatives have spent the past few days advocating against abortion at the March for Life and transgender rights at other bill hearings.\n\nOne proposal from state Sen. Scott Wiener, which he\u2019s calling the Transgender State of Refuge, builds on a law he passed in 2022 that prevents law enforcement from accessing some medical records around gender-affirming care.\n\nWiener\u2019s bill this year, SB 497, closes a loophole in the prior bill, now requiring a warrant for law enforcement when they want to access a prescription drug database that could be used to identify transgender men accessing testosterone. The bill also expands the state\u2019s shield laws to prohibit health care providers from complying with subpoenas that require them to disclose medical information about gender-affirming care. It\u2019s similar to two other measures passed in recent years, SB 345 from former state Sen. Nancy Skinner and AB 1666 from Assemblymember Rebecca Bauer-Kahan. Together, they create a thicket of legal protections for patients and providers of both abortion and gender-affirming care to keep out-of-state law enforcement out of patient records and doctors\u2019 offices.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s this commonality of the government trying to micromanage not just people\u2019s lives, but micromanage who they are and what kind of life they\u2019re allowed to live,\u201d Wiener said in an interview with POLITICO.\n\nAnother bill on Planned Parenthood\u2019s list this year is AB 82 from Assemblymember Chris Ward, which also intertwines protections for gender-affirming care with protections for abortion care.\n\nWard\u2019s bill would prevent prescriptions for testosterone or mifepristone (often used in abortions) from even being entered in the prescription drug database mentioned in Wiener\u2019s bill.\n\nIt also extends some existing protections for reproductive health and abortion providers to gender-affirming care providers as well. Today, abortion providers, patients and volunteers who fear harassment or violence have extra privacy and confidentiality protections to prevent doxxing, or sharing personal information online to harass them. Ward\u2019s bill would extend those protections to patients and providers of gender-affirming care as well.\n\n\u201cIt is imperative that we support the privacy and safety of patients and their families,\u201d Ward said in a statement.\n\nThe specter of the Trump administration looms large over the entire bill package. One proposal, from Sen. Akilah Weber-Pierson \u2014 who is also a trained OB-GYN \u2014 is a direct response to the administration\u2019s threats to cut Medicaid.\n\nHer bill, SB 528, proposes creating \u201cThe Health Care Maintenance and Expansion Fund,\u201d which would use state revenue or private donations to pay for services that could be cut from Medicaid. This is meant to ensure that if the Trump administration ends Medi-Cal funding that\u2019s used for treatments and services like abortion, family planning or gender-affirming care, the state would still offer its own funding. It\u2019s extra pertinent now, as the Trump administration just announced tens of millions of dollars in cuts to the Title X family planning program, including delays in grants to California.\n\nWeber-Pierson said she is \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d about the Title X grants, which are used to help low-income people get STI screenings, contraception and other reproductive health care services. Her bill wasn\u2019t specifically written in response to the Title X cuts, but could ultimately help fill those gaps, she said.\n\n\u201cWhether it could help backfill some of this lost funding will ultimately depend on the budget process and how we implement it, but I am committed to fighting for the resources necessary to protect reproductive healthcare access in our state,\u201d Weber-Pierson said in a statement to POLITICO.\n\nHicks said the bill could also help Planned Parenthoods around the state: as one of if not the largest providers of gender-affirming care in the state, the clinics could also lose Medicaid funding under the executive order from Trump that threatens to cut funding to anyone that provides this care.\n\nAnd in order to further shore up the state\u2019s reproductive and sexual health infrastructure, Planned Parenthood is also supporting SB 339 from state Sen. Christopher Cabaldon to increase the rates Medi-Cal pays for STI testing.\n\nPlanned Parenthood is also working on medication abortion access with two bills, AB 54 from Assemblymember Maggy Krell and AB 260 from Assembly Majority Leader Cecilia Aguiar-Curry. They both reaffirm the right to access mifepristone in the state, and Hicks said they could both change throughout the legislative process if lawmakers adjust for other potential state impacts from Washington.\n\nAguiar-Curry\u2019s bill is modeled off a similar one that just became law in New York, which lets providers keep their names off abortion medication prescriptions, and adds extra privacy protections as well.\n\n\u201cWith federal threats to reproductive rights, it\u2019s more important than ever that we stand strong in protecting the rights of California women and their health care providers to make decisions for ourselves and our families,\u201d Aguiar-Curry said in a statement.\n",
