Students, researchers, and members of the wider public health community were there, in a lecture hall at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and on Zoom, to rescue data. Whatever they could. According to the flier for the Preserving Public Health Data Hackathon, the current Trump administration was trying to undermine research on everything from climate change to systemic racism, and saving data from government websites meant it would be archived and republished in the event federal agencies tried to remove it. The antiauthoritarian theme came up often: don\u2019t obey in advance.\n\nEveryone in the room and on the Zoom got a crash course in identifying at-risk information, collecting it, and storing it once they did. Backing up certain pieces seemed critical.\n\nFor those who work in public health, protecting research pertaining to gender identity and diversity issues has been a focus since the inauguration. Last year, then-candidate Trump repeated a lot of anti-trans rhetoric on the campaign trail, and in the first weeks of his presidency signed executive orders essentially barring transgender people from serving in the military, proclaiming that the US government would only recognize \u201ctwo genders, male and female,\u201d threatening to withhold federal funds in what is an attempt to bar trans women from sports, and attempting to block gender-affirming care for people under the age of 19. Since Trump\u2019s inauguration, hundreds of words\u2014from \u201ctransgender\u201d to \u201cLatinx\u201d to \u201caccessible\u201d\u2014have been removed from federal agencies\u2019 websites. In early February, thousands of websites went missing as agencies raced to comply with the executive orders.\n\nIn recent weeks, the targeting of gender-related material has become even starker, after Trump told a joint session of Congress that the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) had uncovered that the federal government had spent $8 million on \u201cmaking mice transgender\u201d (it hasn\u2019t), and the Department of Defense performed a purge of \u201cDEI\u201d materials that included flagging, but ultimately not removing, images of the Enola Gay.\n\nOne particular dataset, the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (commonly shortened to YRBS), seems particularly at-risk, notes Ariel Beccia, an epidemiologist at the Chan School\u2019s LGBTQ Health Center of Excellence. The YRBS, which tracks scores of health-related issues in young people, is one of the only nationally representative surveys that regularly collects data on transgender kids. Beccia and other public health researchers fear the information in the YRBS may not be available forever.\n\nAnd even if the YRBS can be backed up, the integrity of its data can\u2019t be completely protected from the influence of the new administration. President Trump\u2019s recent moves have also left some in public service afraid to participate in new research, like this year\u2019s survey. \u201cBecause of this \u2018comply in advance\u2019 strategy, school boards are hesitant to participate in the YRBS,\u201d Beccia told attendees at the hackathon.\n\nBeccia would know. Her research focuses on race and ethnicity as well as LGBTQ+ young people. She\u2019s recently been looking into LGTBQ+ inequities in eating disorders. Her work relies on YRBS data. Now that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which hosts the survey\u2019s results, has reportedly stopped processing data on trans Americans, and fewer schools are participating, the data Beccia uses, even if it stays online, will be incomplete.\n\nWhen asked about this, CDC spokesperson Melissa Dibble confirmed that, in compliance with Trump\u2019s executive orders, \u201cthe transgender identity question was removed from the national Youth Risk Behavior Survey,\u201d but no other changes were made. Dibble added that the change shouldn\u2019t delay the survey\u2019s results.\n\nIt\u2019s created a \u201cdouble whammy\u201d situation, Beccia says, where government employees are trying to comply with Trump\u2019s executive orders and school districts are afraid to participate in any study related to gender or LGBTQ+ health, even if it is data that in turn guides how they run their schools.\n\n\u201cWe are living through a pretty scary time with the administration,\u201d Beccia tells me a few days after the event. \u201cThis is obviously impacting the mental health of everyone in the country, especially queer and trans people and queer and trans youth, and we\u2019re not going to have data on this.\u201d\n\nThe YRBS is just one of many datasets researchers have sought to shore up in a long-running effort to preserve government-funded information as the new administration takes control. The University of Washington Information School held \u201cData Rescue\u201d events in January aimed at collecting climate crisis information. The Environmental Data and Governance Initiative (EDGI), a network of research professionals that launched a tool during Trump\u2019s first term to track changes to environmental information on federal websites, relaunched that tracker at the beginning of March. The Data Rescue Project, a consortium of data-rescue organizations, lists dozens of ways people can get involved if they want to help collect. A group of archivists has recreated the pre-Inauguration Day version of the CDC website and is now hosting it in Europe at RestoredCDC.org.\n\nOther organizations are also looking to back up the YRBS, too. On January 30, soon after Trump signed the first of his executive orders aimed at trans Americans, Libby Hemphill, director of the Resource Center for Minority Data at The Inter-University Consortium of Political and Social Research (ICPSR), started getting calls. Word had gotten out that the CDC might be scrubbing data, including the YRBS, and people wanted to know how to stop it. Hemphill gathered some colleagues and started scraping it. Then there were requests for data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), from the Department of Education, from the National Institutes of Health.\n\nMuch like the data-preservation effort at the Chan School, Hemphill and her team coordinated ways for people to submit data they wanted to preserve and ways for researchers to collect it and store it. The ICPSR runs a repository known as DataLumos, where a lot of the preservation efforts are backing up their collections. When I ask Hemphill if she\u2019s worried about the safety of the information in the DataLumos archive, she says \u201cit\u2019s absolutely something that we think about,\u201d adding, \u201cI can assure you that ICPSR has a non-US physical, non-US regulatory plan for data preservation.\u201d\n\nIf you think this sounds familiar, you\u2019re not wrong. When Trump assumed the presidency in 2017, scientists, archivists, and librarians at the University of Pennsylvania raced to save data published by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and NOAA. Another group in Michigan, also fearing the EPA and NOAA websites would lose valuable information, made a similar move. Websites were backed up to the Internet Archive; large datasets were \u201cbagged\u201d for safe keeping.\n\nAt the time, the researchers weren\u2019t sure the incoming administration would seek to erase any info. It was more like a hunch, one that proved prescient when, then being led by Trump appointee and agency administrator Scott Pruitt, the EPA began removing climate change information from its website in April 2017, \u201cto reflect the approach of new leadership.\u201d\n\nBetween 2017 and 2021, more than 1,400 pages related to climate change on government web sites were altered or made less accessible, according to data compiled by the EDGI. That, notes Gretchen Gehrke, who leads EDGI\u2019s website monitoring program, is not \u201ca comprehensive list of changes,\u201d since some alterations\u2014like removing \u201cClimate Change\u201d from the navigation page of EPA.gov\u2014only get counted once but affect several other pages.\n\n\u201cI think there is a lot more awareness about the precarity of federal information after having experienced the first Trump administration,\u201d Gehrke says. \u201cWatching the Trump campaign become truly obsessed with trans people, and knowing the Trump administration\u2019s history of information suppression, people were and are rightly concerned that that information is at risk.\u201d\n\nWhich is why Beccia is concerned. Datasets like those in the YRBS are few and far between and losing it could be disastrous to those wanting to know about the health and well-being of trans youth in America.\n\nAlthough the YRBS is currently live on the CDC\u2019s website, it did briefly disappear, along with data on the Food and Drug Administration and Department of Health and Human Services web sites, earlier this year following an order from the Office of Personnel Management that it be scrubbed to comply with Trump\u2019s executive orders.\n\nThe information returned in mid-February when US District Judge John Bates, responding to a lawsuit from Doctors for America, granted a temporary restraining order and the site was reinstated. A disclaimer at the top of the YRBS page now says \u201cany information on this page promoting gender ideology is extremely inaccurate,\u201d adding \u201cthis page does not reflect biological reality and therefore the administration and this department rejects it.\u201d\n\nTazlina Mannix worked for the YRBS program in Alaska from 2015 until 2023, both as survey coordinator and data manager. She notes that even if the CDC keeps the data online, disclaimers like the one on the site now make it harder for researchers to do their work. Collecting public health data relies on relationships with people in health departments and school districts. Giving those people any reason to hesitate can \u201cset you back to zero,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen I first saw [that disclaimer], I was so horrified. The language is so extreme, and it\u2019s also just wrong.\u201d",
