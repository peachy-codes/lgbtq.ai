  "content": "Multiple European countries have issued advisories for transgender people traveling to the U.S. in light of the Trump administration\u2019s recent guidance regarding sex markers on passports, as well as the federal government\u2019s immigration crackdown and general heightened scrutiny of travel documents and borders.\n\nDenmark, Finland, and Germany have all issued guidance this past month advising trans travelers to check with U.S. authorities before attempting to enter the country, the Associated Press reported. Last Friday, Denmark\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs updated its website to note that there are only two gender designations when applying for a visa to the U.S. \u201cIf your passport has the gender designation X or you have changed gender, it is recommended to contact the US embassy prior to travel for guidance on how to proceed,\u201d the website now reads. (Danes have been able to designate an X gender marker on identity documents since 2014, per ILGA-Europe.)\n\nFinland also updated its travel advisory earlier this month, according to The Guardian, with its travel advice page now reading, \u201cIf the applicant\u2019s current sex on their passport is different from their sex confirmed at birth, the U.S. authorities may refuse entry.\u201d Additionally, the German daily newspaper, Rheinische Post, reported in February that Germany\u2019s Federal Foreign Office stated that trans and nonbinary people should contact the U.S.\u2019s German embassy before traveling to the country.\n\nWhen asked about those advisories, a State Department spokesperson told NPR that the U.S. \u201cwill enforce visa rules and other conditions of entry.\u201d\n\n\u201cProhibiting travel into the United States by those who might pose a threat or violate conditions of their visa is key to protecting the American people,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nThough none of the countries\u2019 advisories mentioned the Trump administration specifically, the updated guidance comes in the wake of the federal government\u2019s attempts to prohibit changes to passport gender markers and abolish X markers. In addition to cracking down on trans people\u2019s identity documents, the federal government has also been subjecting all foreign travel to additional layers of scrutiny. Earlier this month, a French researcher was denied entry to the U.S. when immigration officers found messages on his phone that were reportedly critical of the Trump administration\u2019s treatment of scientists. The U.S. has also been engaging in mass deportations despite a judge\u2019s order, including that of over 200 Venezuelan men, one of whom is a gay asylum seeker.\n\nThe U.K. and Canada have also issued stronger warnings about the U.S. government. According to Reuters, the British foreign office\u2019s travel advice section now states, \u201cThe authorities in the U.S. set and enforce entry rules strictly. You may be liable to arrest or detention if you break the rules.\u201d It previously read, \u201cThe authorities in the U.S. set and enforce entry rules.\u201d Meanwhile, Canada\u2019s travel advisory website states that Canadians visiting the U.S. for \u201clonger than 30 days must be registered with the United States government,\u201d or risk \u201cpenalties, fines and misdemeanor prosecution.\u201d As NPR notes, this isn\u2019t the first time other countries have issued travel advisories for the U.S., but those have largely been related to gun violence, not the government itself.",
