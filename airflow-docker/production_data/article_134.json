In one video filmed without Gaston\u2019s knowledge, an Accuracy in Media member poses as the parent of a trans daughter who is considering moving to Texas and wants to know if her daughter would be allowed to play on a girls\u2019 soccer team.\n\nTexas currently bars trans athletes in K-12 schools and public Texas colleges from competing in categories that do not correspond with their assigned sex at birth. Even if a student were to change the gender on their birth certificate they wouldn\u2019t be allowed to play, because state law only recognizes changes to birth certificates that result from clerical error. However, it\u2019s unclear how schools are meant to determine whether or not a birth certificate has been modified.\n\nIn the video from Accuracy in Media, Gaston appears to suggest that this \u201cparent\u201d could use an updated birth certificate in hopes of helping her daughter play on a girls\u2019 soccer team.\n\n\u201c[The state] said birth certificate,\u201d she says. \u201cThey didn\u2019t say \u2018original\u2019 or \u2018updated\u2019... They find the loopholes in everything.\u201d\n\nLater, Gaston emphasizes that she\u2019s dedicated to looking out for LGBTQ+ students, adding, \u201cI tell people all the time, I will go to jail for saving their child\u2019s life. I guess no conservative kids come out gay.\u201d\n\nDallas ISD issued its own statement confirming that the school district is aware of Paxton\u2019s pre-suit request for depositions.\n\n\u201cWe are cooperating with the Attorney General\u2019s office to provide information that confirms Dallas ISD\u2019s ongoing compliance with federal and state laws,\u201d the statement continued, per local news outlet WFAA. \u201cThe district is committed to continue following both the spirit and intent of the law.\u201d\n\nOn March 4, Gaston\u2019s friend Farris Steel started a GoFundMe to help cover her basic living expenses while she searches for a new job. According to Steel, Dallas ISD terminated Gaston\u2019s employment after she faced harassment and doxxing in the aftermath of Accuracy in Media\u2019s video being posted online.\n\n\u201cMahoganie is an unwavering ally, deeply committed to the belief that her liberation is bound to the liberation of LGBTQ+ people,\u201d Steel\u2019s GoFundMe page reads. \u201c[...] These attacks are meant to silence educators and enact a chilling effect on LGBTQ+ inclusion in schools. But Mahoganie remains undaunted: she is ready to keep fighting.\u201d\n\nThese deposition requests are only the latest development in Paxton\u2019s obsession with targeting trans student athletes. In February, he sued the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) on behalf of the state of Texas, demanding that the organization conduct \u201csex screenings\u201d of student athletes to ensure that trans women are not allowed to compete in sporting events that align with their gender. This move came even after the NCAA banned trans women from competing in women\u2019s sports.\n\nAt the time, Paxton claimed that the NCAA is not complying with Donald Trump\u2019s February 5 executive order, derisively titled \u201cKeep Men Out of Women\u2019s Sports.\u201d The order itself does not have the power to immediately ban trans women and girls from sports nationwide, although it does threaten to \u201crescind all funds from educational programs\u201d that allow trans girls to participate in girls\u2019 sports.",
