  "content": "House Speaker Mike Johnson failed to answer a very easy question lobbed at him Tuesday morning. He was asked whether Rep. Sarah McBride, an incoming freshman lawmaker from Delaware who identifies as transgender, is a man or a woman. McBride is a man who presents as a woman, so Johnson\u2019s answer should have been easy: McBride is a man.\n\nBut he couldn\u2019t do it. Instead, he smirked and deflected. \u201cI\u2019m not gonna get into this,\u201d he said. \u201cWe treat all persons with dignity and respect. And we will. And I\u2019m not going to engage in silly debates about this.\u201d\n\nJohnson did, however, acknowledge that \u201cthere\u2019s a concern about the uses of restroom facilities and locker room and all that.\u201d Oh is there?\n\nThe background here is that Rep. Nancy Mace, who understandably doesn\u2019t want to share a bathroom or a locker room with McBride, or any other man, introduced a bill stipulating that on Capitol Hill women must use the women\u2019s facilities and men must use the men\u2019s.\n\nIt would have been the easiest thing in the world for Johnson to have simply said, \u201cMcBride is a man and he will have to use the men\u2019s facilities here in Congress. Just because he dresses as a woman or thinks he\u2019s a woman doesn\u2019t make him one. Next question.\u201d\n\nJohnson seems to think it\u2019s still 2012 and Republicans need to accept, or pretend to accept, the underlying premises of the woke left-wing worldview. He has apparently missed out on the vibe shift that just delivered a landslide victory to President-elect Donald Trump along with the Senate and House to Republicans.\n\nHe also seems unaware that the trans issue is a giant loser that most people are slowly backing away from and want nothing to do with. An overwhelming number of Americans now agree on transgender issues. According to one recent survey, 72 percent of Americans think it should be illegal to give children under age 18 puberty blockers and \u201cgender reassignment\u201d surgeries. Just 13 percent think boys should be allowed to compete in girls\u2019 sports, and only 19 percent think transgender propaganda should be taught in public schools.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Trump won and Republicans have a majority in large part because of ads trashing Democrats\u2019 transgender nonsense. After such a resounding victory, Johnson is now too scared to come out and state plainly that men are not allowed in women\u2019s bathrooms on Capitol Hill?\n\nPerhaps sensing he was being mercilessly mocked for being a weak coward, Johnson quickly convened an impromptu press conference later on Tuesday to \u201cclarify\u201d and \u201cwalk forward\u201d his earlier remarks. \u201cFor anybody who doesn\u2019t know my well-established record on this issue, let me be unequivocally clear. A man is a man and a woman is a woman. And a man cannot become a woman,\u201d Johnson said. He then made noises about treating everyone with dignity.\n\nHe prefaced these remarks by explaining that he had \u201crejected the premise\u201d of the earlier question about McBride, \u201cbecause the answer is so obvious.\u201d But he hadn\u2019t reject the premise, he simply refused to answer because it made him uncomfortable. He also never answered the original question, which was whether McBride is a man or a woman. If he had really wanted to reject the premise and answer the question he would have said, \u201cI reject the premise of the question. McBride is a man, no matter how he dresses or what he calls himself.\u201d\n\nBut even after his attempt to be \u201cunequivocally clear,\u201d he still hadn\u2019t answered the specific question about whether McBride is a man or a woman, or indicated what would happen to Mace\u2019s bill.\n\nThis shouldn\u2019t be hard, and it\u2019s frankly amazing that a Republican House Speaker, flush from a massive electoral victory that will leave the executive and legislative branches of government in GOP hands come January, would fail so spectacularly on this very basic question. Every single Republican should support Mace\u2019s measure to ban men from women\u2019s spaces on Capitol Hill, and anyone who isn\u2019t on board should be shamed, mocked, and thrown out of office. That\u2019s what Johnson should have said, and without a second thought. But he didn\u2019t because he\u2019s a mealy-mouthed coward who\u2019s afraid of being called mean things by the corporate press.\n\nFor her part, Mace isn\u2019t backing down. Asked about it on Tuesday, Mace said, \u201cIf \u2026 being a feminist makes me an extremist, I\u2019m totally here for it. \u2026 I\u2019m not going to stand for a man, you know, someone with a penis, is in the women\u2019s locker room \u2014 that\u2019s not okay.\u201d\n\nAnd for her trouble, Mace immediately started getting death threats from trans activists, one of whom said he wanted to find her in the women\u2019s bathroom and kill her by bashing her face into the floor.\n\nThe time for tolerating this insanity is over. Americans should refuse to go along with the delusion that men who dress up like women are anything other than disturbed men who need professional help. And we should demand that our elected leaders show more spine on this issue than Speaker Johnson was able to muster on Tuesday. ",
