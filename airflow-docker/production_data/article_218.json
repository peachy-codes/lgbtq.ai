Walmart will also stop giving priority treatment to suppliers based on DEI factors such as race or gender, the AP reported.\n\nWalmart said it will be monitoring its third-party marketplace items more closely to ensure they do not feature sexual and transgender products marketed toward minors, including chest binders intended for youth, according to the AP.\n\n\u201cOur purpose, to help people save money and live better, has been at our core since our founding 62 years ago and continues to guide us today,\u201d Walmart said in a statement shared with the Daily Caller News Foundation. \u201cWe can deliver on it because we are willing to change alongside our associates and customers who represent all of America. We\u2019ve been on a journey and know we aren\u2019t perfect, but every decision comes from a place of wanting to foster a sense of belonging, to open doors to opportunities for all our associates, customers and suppliers and to be a Walmart for everyone.\u201d\n\nVarious corporations have been quietly backpedaling their DEI practices amid intense public and legal pressure from consumers and shareholders. President-elect Donald Trump has criticized DEI practices and promised to uproot \u201cwoke\u201d ideology. Dozens of investment advisors sent letters on Nov. 15 warning several of America\u2019s largest corporations that their diversity programs will become a liability when Trump returns to the White House.\n\nSeveral companies have faced backlash from supporting DEI and LGBTQ initiatives, including Target, which reported in August 2023 that it was lowering its sales and profit expectations for the rest of the year, after it faced criticism over the release of LGBTQ products for children. Target announced in May that it would only sell its LGBTQ \u201cPride\u201d collection online and at select stores after boycotts cost the retailer nearly $13 billion in market value the summer prior, according to Bloomberg. The retailer\u2019s stock prices also dropped in 2016 amid boycotts after it introduced a policy allowing customers to choose the dressing room or restroom that aligned with their gender identity.\n\nBud Light\u2019s pours reportedly declined in thousands of bars and restaurants across the U.S. after the brand partnered with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney in 2023. The company lost $1.4 billion in U.S. beer sales in 2023 due to boycotts over the marketing decision, according to Forbes.\n\nOther major companies have also recently backtracked DEI-related policies, including Lowe\u2019s, Ford and Stanley Black & Decker.
