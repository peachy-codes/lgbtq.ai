The order says a person is male or female and it rejects the idea that someone can transition from the sex assigned at birth to another gender. The framing is in line with many conservatives\u2019 views but at odds with major medical groups and policies under former President Joe Biden.\n\nREAD MORE: Federal judge blocks Trump ban on transgender people serving in military\n\nU.S. District Judge Julia Kobick, who was appointed by President Joe Biden, sided with the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction, which stays the action while the lawsuit plays out.\n\n\u201cThe Executive Order and the Passport Policy on their face classify passport applicants on the basis of sex and thus must be reviewed under intermediate judicial scrutiny,\u201d Kobick wrote. \u201cThat standard requires the government to demonstrate that its actions are substantially related to an important governmental interest.
