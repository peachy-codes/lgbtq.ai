Kim Reynolds signed into law a bill that opponents say will expose transgender people and other Iowans to discrimination in all aspects of daily life.\n\nThe new law, which goes into effect July 1, follows several years of action from Reynolds and Iowa Republicans to restrict transgender students\u2019 use of such spaces as bathrooms and locker rooms, and their participation on sports teams, in an effort to protect people assigned female at birth. Republicans say those policies cannot co-exist with a civil rights code that includes gender identity protections.\n\nThe law also creates explicit legal definitions of female and male based on their reproductive organs at birth, rejecting the idea that a person can transition to another gender. Reynolds proposed a similar bill last year, but it didn\u2019t make it to a vote of the full House or Senate.\n\n\u201cWomen and men are not identical; they possess unique biological differences. That\u2019s not controversial, it\u2019s common sense,\u201d Reynolds said in a statement at the time. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that defining a woman in code has become necessary to protect spaces where women\u2019s health, safety, and privacy are being threatened.\u201d She added that such spaces included domestic violence shelters and rape crisis centers.\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed an executive order on his first day in office to formalize a definition of the two sexes at the federal level, leading several Republican-led legislatures to push for laws defining male and female. Trump posted in support of the Iowa bill on his Truth Social platform Thursday after it got final approval from the Iowa House and Senate.\n\nFive House Republicans joined all Democrats in the House and Senate in voting against the bill. Iowa state Rep. Aime Wichtendahl was the final Democrat to speak before the vote, wiping away tears as she offered her personal story as a transgender woman, saying: \u201cI transitioned to save my life.\u201d \u201cThe purpose of this bill and the purpose of every anti-trans bill is to further erase us from public life and to stigmatize our existence,\u201d Wichtendahl said. \u201cThe sum total of every anti-trans and anti-LGBTQ bill is to make our existence illegal.\u201d\n\nHundreds of LGBTQ+ advocates streamed into the Capitol rotunda on Thursday waving signs reading \u201cTrans rights are human rights\u201d and chanting slogans including, \u201cNo hate in our state!\u201d There was a heavy police presence, with state troopers stationed around the rotunda. The few protesters who lingered for final passage of the bill were emotional. Not every state includes gender identity in their civil rights code, but Iowa is now the first in the U.S. to remove nondiscrimination protections based on gender identity, said Logan Casey, director of policy research at the Movement Advancement Project, an LGBTQ+ rights think tank. Sexual orientation and gender identity were not originally included in the state\u2019s Civil Rights Act of 1965. They were added by the Democratic-controlled Legislature in 2007, also with the support of about a dozen Republicans across the two chambers.\n\nThe House Republican moving the bill Thursday, Rep. Steven Holt, said that if the Legislature can add protections, it can remove them.\n\nAs of July 1, Iowa\u2019s civil rights law will protect against discrimination based on race, color, creed, sex, sexual orientation, religion, national origin or disability status.\n\nAdvocacy groups promise to defend transgender rights, which may lead them to court.\n\nKeenan Crow, director of policy and advocacy for LGBTQ+ advocacy group One Iowa, said the organization is still analyzing the text of the bill and that its vagueness makes it \u201chard to determine where the enforcement is going to come from.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will pursue any legal options available to us,\u201d Crow said.",
