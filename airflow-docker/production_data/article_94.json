  "content": "When 20-year-old college student Marcy Rheintgen made her yearly spring break trip to her grandparents\u2019 property in Florida, she said she felt at peace \u2014 until March 19, when police escorted her out of the bathroom of the State Capitol Building and placed her in handcuffs. Evidently, Rheintgen had violated a 2023 state law criminalizing trans people who use government-owned public restrooms that align with their gender.\n\nTampa Bay Times reporter Romy Ellenbogen accompanied Rheintgen to the Capitol. When they arrived, several officers were stationed outside the women\u2019s restroom doors. They warned her not to enter the women\u2019s restroom. Draped in a white, frilly dress and a pink bow, Rheintgen went in anyway and washed her hands.\n\nThat\u2019s when police entered the restroom and told Rheintgen she was being detained. A devout Catholic, she had wanted to take a moment to pray the rosary, but she never got the chance.\n\nAfter spending less than 60 seconds in the women\u2019s restroom, Rheintgen said, she was charged with trespassing with a warning.\n\nMeanwhile, her rosary was confiscated as an officer from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement handcuffed and detained Rheintgen, searched her person and her vehicle, and then shuttled her to the Leon County Detention Facility, where she stayed overnight in the men\u2019s ward. If convicted, she could spend up to 60 days incarcerated.\n\nThe FDLE did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nAbout a week before her trek, she sent about a hundred and sixty print letters to Florida lawmakers announcing she would engage in the time-honored practice of civil disobedience: She would use the women\u2019s restroom at the Florida State Capitol. She named her date and time.\n\n\u201cI know that as a transgender woman, this means I will probably be arrested. I am violating laws because I personally believe it to be wrong.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a political activist,\u201d she told Erin in the Morning. \u201cI\u2019m just a normal college student who thinks this law is wrong.\u201d\n\nThe letters included a photo of herself so that officials could identify her. \u201cI understand I could go to jail for up to sixty days in a men\u2019s prison, where if the statistics are true, I would likely be raped.\u201d\n\nShe writes that going to jail would \u201cuproot her life,\u201d but this was a risk she was willing to take:\n\n\u201cI understand that if you're receiving this letter, you're part of the Florida Bicameral Legislature, which means you're probably one of the people who wrote this law or voted for it. I know that you know in your heart that this law is wrong and unjust. I know that you know in your heart that it's wrong to arrest me and jail me for sixty days for simply using the bathroom. I know that you know in your heart that transgender people are human too, and that you can't arrest us away. I know that you know in your heart that transgender people are no different from you or anybody else. I know that you know in your heart that the same people that go to church with you, eat in the same restaurants, go to the same schools, root for the same sports teams, watch the same movies and pray to the same God as you cannot be all bad. I know that you know that I have dignity. That's why I know that you won't arrest me.\u201d\n\nSigning off, she added: \u201cPray for me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a really religious person,\u201d she told Erin in the Morning. She\u2019s a devout Catholic who describes herself as a political centrist, with an appreciation for \u201cfamily values\u201d but a soft spot for Dorothy Day, the prolific Catholic leftwing activist.\n\nA police affidavit she shared with Erin in the Morning \u2014 with her deadname (blurred out below), and the wrong pronouns listed \u2014 otherwise corroborates most all of her story.\n\nRheintgen\u2019s telling is also corroborated by reports from the Tampa Bay Times journalist who accompanied Rheintgen to the bathroom.\n\n\u201cI actually wanted to move to Florida when I was older, growing up, but I don't know if I can do that now, \" she said. She fondly remembers her favorite beaches and bologna sandwiches with her grandparents. But now, it seems, her \u201chome away from home\u201d isn\u2019t safe for her.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want attention. I just want people to see this law and how crazy it is to put people like us in jail. I was so terrified,\u201d she said. She admits she hadn\u2019t consulted legal or advocacy organizations before the endeavor; she didn\u2019t know what to expect. \u201cThey were treating me like I murdered someone \u2014 but I just used the wrong bathroom.\u201d\n\nRheintgen said she was motivated to act after seeing the anti-trans legislation surge throughout the United States, and when she read about Hunter Schafer, the Euphoria actress, who was issued a \u201cmale\u201d passport despite being a woman. \u201cShe\u2019s a personal hero of mine,\u201d Rheintgen said. The fear and the vitriol she saw play out over the news cycle brought her to a breaking point.\n\nWhile bills like bathroom bans and drag bans have been sweeping the country in recent years, the criminalization of gender diverse people is by no means new. Black and brown trans women, especially, have been routinely criminalized for decades under the guise of \u201csolicitation\u201d or \u201cloitering\u201d ordinances, even in a so-called liberal stronghold like New York. The phenomenon is so pervasive that it has been dubbed the \u201cWalking While Trans Ban.\u201d\n\nJon Harris Maurer, Public Policy Director of Equality Florida, emphasized that the bathroom bans are just the latest attempt by the state\u2019s GOP to eradicate trans people from public life. \u201cThese are hard working, tax paying individuals who are our family, neighbors, and colleagues,\u201d he told Erin in the Morning. \u201cWeaponizing bathroom access in a place like the State Capitol is an antidemocratic effort to block them from directly participating in government while simultaneously stripping their rights behind closed doors.\u201d",
