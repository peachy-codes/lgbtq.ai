And get this: The president of the school board attempted to block the pure emotion out.\n\nThe scene went down Wednesday in Arroyo Grande, California, while the Lucia Mar Unified School District (LMUSD) board was holding a meeting. Celeste Diest, a junior who competes on the Arroyo Grande High School girls\u2019 track team, testified to the board about what she\u2019s been experiencing around a trans athlete.\n\nDiest talked about the embarrassment that she\u2019s been through being forced to share a locker room with a male, saying that the trans athlete looked at her and her teammates while they were getting undressed. (RELATED: Illinois Joins List Of States Who Are Refusing To Comply With Trump\u2019s Executive Order On Trans Athletes)\n\n\u201cI went into the women\u2019s locker room to change for track practice where I saw, at the end of my row, a biological male watching not only myself, but the other young women undress. This experience was beyond traumatizing,\u201d said Diest while crying.\n\n\u201cOkay, please wrap it up,\u201d warned LMUSD board President Colleen Martin, interrupting Diest while she was speaking\n\n\u201cI just want to ask, \u2018what about us?'\u201d continued Diest. \u201cWe cannot sit around and allow our rights to be given up to cater to an individual that is a man, who watches women undress and is stripping away female opportunity that once was fought for us. Sadly we have to try and regain our rights back. I hope you put effort into the restoration of our school safety.\u201d\n\nImagine being ruthless to a teenage girl like this \u2026 like they don\u2019t have enough problems in today\u2019s climate.",
