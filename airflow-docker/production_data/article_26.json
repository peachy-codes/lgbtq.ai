  "content": "A judge on Wednesday temporarily blocked a Montana law that restricts transgender people\u2019s use of bathrooms in public buildings.\n\nThe measure, which Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte signed into effect last week, threatened to deprive transgender people of their constitutional right to equal protection under the law, Montana District Court Judge Shane Vannatta ruled. The law prevents people from using restrooms in public buildings that do not align with the sex they were assigned at birth.\n\nThe five people who sued over the law were likely to prevail, Vannatta added in his ruling.\n\nThe new law \u201cis motivated by animus and supported by no evidence that its restrictions advance its purported purpose to protect women\u2019s safety and privacy,\u201d Vannatta wrote.\n\nThe judge\u2019s order will be in effect at least until an April 21 hearing on whether it should continue to be blocked while the lawsuit moves ahead. Gianforte spokesperson Kaitlin Price said the governor will defend the law \u201cand the privacy and safety of women and girls.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not surprised to see far-left activists run to the courts to stop this common sense law,\u201d Price said in an emailed statement. \u201cA man shouldn\u2019t be in a women\u2019s restroom, shouldn\u2019t be in a women\u2019s shower room and shouldn\u2019t be housed in a women\u2019s prison.\u201d The American Civil Liberties Union praised the ruling.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s ruling provides enormous relief to trans Montanans across the state. The state\u2019s relentless attacks on trans and Two Spirit people cannot withstand constitutional scrutiny by the courts,\u201d said a statement by Alex Rate, ACLU of Montana\u2019s legal director.\n\n\nThe law passed this year despite opposition from Democrats who worried it would complicate daily life for two fellow lawmakers who are transgender and nonbinary. They included Rep. Zooey Zephyr, a Missoula Democrat who in 2023 was silenced and sanctioned by her Republican colleagues for comments she made on the House floor. The law would require public buildings including the state Capitol, schools, jails, prisons, libraries and state-funded domestic violence shelters to provide separate spaces for men and women. It defines the sexes based on a person\u2019s chromosomes and reproductive biology, despite a recent state court ruling that declared the definitions unconstitutional.\n\nThe order wasn\u2019t unexpected, bill sponsor Republican Rep. Kerri Seekins-Crowe said in an emailed statement.\n\n\u201cI am thankful that there is a team of Montanans devoted to protecting women\u2019s spaces from men who desire to invade them,\u201d said Seekins-Crowe.\n\nAt least a dozen other states already have variations of bathroom bans on the books, many directed at schools. Even more states, including Montana, have passed laws to ban gender-affirming medical care for transgender children and keep trans girls out of girls sports.\n\nMontana\u2019s law allows people to sue a facility if it does not prevent people from using restrooms or changing rooms that do not align with their sex assigned at birth. They can recover nominal damages, generally $1, and the entity could be required to pay the plaintiff\u2019s legal fees.\n\n\n\n\n\n",
