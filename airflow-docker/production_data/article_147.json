Anti-transgender activists hailed the decision, though legal experts say its full ramifications are still unclear.\n\nThe Court issued its ruling with a unanimous 5-0 decision in the case For Women Scotland v. The Scottish Ministers. For Women Scotland (FWS) is an anti-trans advocacy group founded in June 2018 specifically to challenge changes to Scotland\u2019s Gender Recognition Act, arguing to the U.K.\u2019s highest court that Scotland should not be allowed to include trans women who have gender recognition certificates (GRCs) as \u201cwomen\u201d for the purposes of meeting gender equity quotas on public boards. The five justices largely sided with FWS in this week\u2019s decision, writing that including cis and trans women in the same legal sex category \u201cwould cut across the definitions of \u2018man\u2019 and \u2018woman\u2019 and thus the protected characteristic of sex in an incoherent way.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe meaning of the terms \u201csex\u201d, \u201cman,\u201d and \u201cwoman\u2019\u201d \u2014 as used in the U.K.\u2019s Equality Act 2010, which bars discrimination based on sex, sexual orientation, and \u201cgender reassignment\u201d \u2014 \u201crefer to biological sex, as any other interpretation would render the EA 2010 incoherent and impracticable to operate,\u201d the Court ruled. Trans people will still theoretically be able to bring \u201cgender reassignment\u201d discrimination claims under the EA 2010, per the ruling, whether they have a GRC or not. But a GRC will no longer hold weight in establishing a person\u2019s legal \u201csex,\u201d meaning that trans women will legally be classed as \u201cmale,\u201d trans men as \u201cfemale,\u201d and nonbinary people as their birth-assigned sex.\n\nAdvocates in the U.K. expressed dismay and surprise at Wednesday\u2019s ruling, but warned that the full 88-page decision is still incompletely understood, and will take time to interpret and implement. It\u2019s not clear how far-ranging the Court\u2019s ruling will be: As the Associated Press reported, it will likely affect Scottish trans people\u2019s ability to serve on the boards of public bodies. Other effects are still up in the air, but numerous sections of the decision are nonetheless chilling and could be far-ranging, legal researcher Jess O\u2019Thomson explained on U.K. LGBTQ+ news site QueerAF on Wednesday.\n\nAs Thomson noted, some passages of the decision appear to be based in part on whether a given trans person \u201cpasses\u201d for cis in their lived gender identity, and could exclude trans people from single-sex spaces depending on whether a cis observer has a \u201creasonable objection\u201d to their presence based on appearance. (The U.K.\u2019s ruling Labour Party told Reuters the decision would \u201cbring clarity\u201d to the debate over legal rights and stated that \u201c[s]ingle-sex spaces are protected in law and will always be protected by this government.\u201d) Other passages refer to a hypothetical trans woman as \u201ca man who identifies as a woman,\u201d declares that misogyny as an oppressive system is generally rooted in cis women\u2019s \u201cshared biology,\u201d and strictly defines the word \u201clesbian\u201d as \u201ca [AFAB] female who is sexually oriented towards (or attracted to) [AFAB] females,\u201d Thomson observed.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no easy way to put it - this decision is terrible for trans people. I have no doubt it will be used as a rallying point for even further attacks on our rights,\u201d Thomson wrote. \u201cWe\u2019re yet to see how all of this will play out in practice, but it seems clear that this won\u2019t just hurt the trans community.\u201d\n\nFWS and other anti-trans campaigners celebrated the ruling, with FWS co-director Susan Smith telling the AP that the decision was \u201ccommon sense\u201d because a person \u201ccan\u2019t change\u201d their sex, and went on to accuse trans people of having \u201ctried to deny science and to deny reality.\u201d FWS funded their legal challenge in part through a public fundraiser, to which children\u2019s author-turned-anti-trans figurehead J.K. Rowling reportedly donated \u00a370,000 in 2024 \u2014 at the time, roughly equivalent to $88,200.\n\nAlthough the Court allowed outside testimony from anti-trans groups such as the nonprofit Sex Matters \u2014 and even praised Sex Matters\u2019 legal counsel Ben Cooper KC for providing \u201cfocus and structure to the argument that \u2018sex,\u2019 \u2018man\u2019 and \u2018woman\u2019 should be given a biological meaning\u201d \u2014 no trans people were allowed to weigh in on the appeal. The Court denied a formal request last year by the Good Law Project to accept testimony from trans legal experts Dr. Victoria McCloud and Prof. Stephen Whittle. \u201c[W]e think it was wrong of the Supreme Court to decide not to hear from any trans voices, even though they\u2019re the only ones whose rights are on the line,\u201d representatives for the Project wrote at the time.\n\nThe Edinburgh-based advocacy group Scottish Trans wrote that its members were \u201cshocked and disappointed\u201d by the ruling in a press release Wednesday, saying the Court\u2019s decision \u201cundercuts the central purpose of the Gender Recognition Act\u201d and goes against 20 years of equality law in the U.K.\n\n\u201cThis judgement appears to have limited the scope of gender recognition so that trans people\u2019s gender will no longer be recognised in many circumstances,\u201d Scottish Trans representatives wrote, adding that they will \u201ccontinue working for a world in which trans people can get on with our lives with privacy, dignity and safety.\u201d\n\nHolly Greenberry-Pullen, co-founder of the intersex rights advocacy group IntersexUK, called the Court\u2019s decision \u201cmental\u201d in a statement to The Independent, saying that the Court ignored the lived realities of intersex people to reinforce simplistic sex norms.\n\n\u201c[W]e clearly and unequivocally prove based on our biology that biological sex and its huge wealth of variations highlight that sex is not binary,\u201d Greenberry-Pullen said, calling the ruling \u201cpolitically charged and factually flawed.\u201d",
