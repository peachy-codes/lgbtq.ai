In February, the Department of Education announced that it was launching an investigation into the Maine Department of Education and a public school district attended by a trans athlete, claiming that the state\u2019s Department of Education violated federal anti-discrimination law. In a March 10 press release, the University of Maine shared that the U.S. Department of Agriculture had suspended all research and program funding to the university amid the President\u2019s ongoing feud with the state\u2019s educational bodies.
