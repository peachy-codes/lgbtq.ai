  "content": "President Donald Trump mounted an offensive against gender ideology as soon as he took office in January, and his administration shows no signs of letting up as it hits the 100-day mark.\n\nGender ideology became a hot-button issue in the years leading up to the November election. Parents across the country became outraged over transgender indoctrination by public school teachers, while female students protested being forced to let males use their bathrooms and play on their sports teams, and detransitioners raised the alarm about doctors pushing children toward puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones, and transgender surgeries.\n\nDuring his campaign, Trump promised to take an axe to gender ideology, and he has followed through on multiple fronts.\n\nIn a day one executive order, Trump officially recognized \u201csex\u201d as biological, either \u201cmale\u201d or \u201cfemale.\u201d This initial order, \u201cDefending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism,\u201d laid the groundwork for his administration\u2019s other actions.\n\n\u201cEfforts to eradicate the biological reality of sex fundamentally attack women by depriving them of their dignity, safety, and well-being,\u201d the order stated.\n\nChild Sex Change Drugs And Surgeries\n\nIn January, Trump signed another executive order, \u201cProtecting Children From Chemical And Surgical Mutilation,\u201d committing that the United States will not fund or support the \u201cso-called \u2018transition\u2019 of a child from one sex to another and that it will rigorously enforce all laws that prohibit or limit these destructive and life-altering procedures.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis dangerous trend will be a stain on our Nation\u2019s history, and it must end,\u201d the order stated.\n\nThis prompted a slew of hospitals to pump the brakes on transgender medicalization for children, including hospitals in New York City, Chicago, Washington, D.C., Philadelphia, Colorado, and Virginia.\n\nOn Monday, the White House published a fact sheet that said during the first three years of the Biden administration, more than 7,000 children were put on puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones, and more than 4,000 children got transgender surgeries like double mastectomies.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services and the Justice Department are leading the crackdown on transgender medical interventions for children.\n\nThe Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services also warned hospitals in March to comply with Trump\u2019s executive orders on the \u201cdangerous chemical and surgical mutilation of children,\u201d or transgender surgeries and hormones.\n\nThe administration also ordered the National Institutes of Health to research \u201cregret\u201d and \u201cdetransition\u201d among children and adults who undergo transgender \u201csocial transition and/or chemical and surgical mutilation.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s day one order also bans federal funds from promoting gender ideology, which includes paying for medical gender transitions for prison inmates, the subject of his most effective campaign ad last year.\n\nThe campaign ad highlighted Harris\u2019s support for taxpayer-funded transgender medical services for prisoners.\n\n\u201cKamala is for they/them. President Trump is for you,\u201d the ad said.\n\nThe ad aired across the nation, including during football games. Trump advisors said the message reached suburban women, who were also being hammered with Democrats\u2019 aggressive abortion ads.\n\nEducation\n\nIn his second week, Trump turned his attention to education, signing an executive order titled \u201cEnding Radical Indoctrination In K-12 Schooling\u201d prohibiting federal funds from going to schools teaching \u201cradical, anti-American ideologies,\u201d including gender ideology.\n\nGender ideology includes the \u201cfalse claim that males can identify as and thus become women and vice versa,\u201d his day one order previously clarified.\n\nIn response, the Education Department scrapped former President Joe Biden\u2019s reinterpretation of Title IX to include trans-identifying men as women, calling it an \u201cunlawful abuse of regulatory power and an egregious slight to women and girls.\u201d Title IX is the federal civil rights law that prohibits sex-based discrimination in public schools.\n\nTrump\u2019s order also prohibits teachers or school counselors from encouraging the \u201csocial transition\u201d of a trans-identifying child, which includes using a new name and pronouns or allowing them to use the bathrooms and play on the sports team of the opposite sex.\n\nThe administration is investigating multiple school districts, including five in Virginia that may be violating Trump\u2019s orders on promoting gender ideology.\n\nThe Education Department also tossed out a slew of complaints about \u201cbook bans,\u201d or school districts removing sexually explicit materials.\n\nThe department has canceled hundreds of millions of dollars in grants to recipients who promote gender ideology, DEI, and Critical Race Theory.\n\nWomen\u2019s Sports\n\nTrump signed an order, \u201cKeeping Men Out Of Women\u2019s Sports,\u201d banning trans-identifying males in girls\u2019 sports by threatening to rescind funds from schools that allow this, saying it \u201cresults in the endangerment, humiliation, and silencing of women and girls and deprives them of privacy.\u201d\n\nIn response to Trump\u2019s order, the NCAA changed its policy to read that a \u201cstudent-athlete assigned male at birth may not compete on a women\u2019s team.\u201d\n\nThe Education Department also opened investigations into several universities for allowing trans-identifying males in women\u2019s sports, including San Jose State University and the University of Pennsylvania, where trans-identifying male swimmer Lia Thomas won races on the women\u2019s team.\n\nOn Monday, the administration said it had found that the University of Pennsylvania violated Title IX and gave the school 10 days to resolve the sports violations or face enforcement from the Justice Department. In March, the administration froze $175 million in taxpayer funding to the school.\n\nIn February, Trump stunned a room full of governors when he told Maine\u2019s governor to her face that her state would not get any federal funding if it continued to buck the president\u2019s executive order on males in women\u2019s sports.\n\n\n\u201cYour population doesn\u2019t want men playing in women\u2019s sports. So you better comply because otherwise you\u2019re not getting any federal funding,\u201d Trump told Governor Janet Mills, a Democrat.\n\nThe administration ultimately moved to strip Maine of the $358.4 million it gets in federal education funding, although that action is blocked in federal court for now. The Agriculture Department also suspended some of Maine\u2019s federal funds for school food programs. The Education Department has also referred Maine\u2019s education department to the Justice Department for \u201cfurther enforcement action.\u201d\n\nThe Education Department is also eyeing California, which also allows trans-identifying males in girls\u2019 high school sports.\n\nThe department opened an investigation into the California Interscholastic Federation, which governs sports at more than 1,500 high schools. The administration has threatened California\u2019s federal funding, but has not yet moved to cut it.\n\nCalifornia also prohibits schools from automatically notifying parents when a student announces a new gender identity, another threat to its federal funding.\n\nOther Moves\n\nTrump prohibited public schools from allowing a trans-identifying child to use the bathroom or locker room of the opposite sex.\n\nTrump\u2019s day-one order also protects women and girls from trans-identifying men in women\u2019s prisons, rape shelters, and other \u201cintimate spaces.\u201d\n\nTrump also issued an order banning trans-identifying members from the military.\n\n\u201cA man\u2019s assertion that he is a woman, and his requirement that others honor this falsehood, is not consistent with the humility and selflessness required of a service member,\u201d the order read.\n\nFederal employees were also instructed to remove pronouns from their email signatures, and, in a surprise move, Trump targeted the Kennedy Center over \u201cDrag Shows specifically targeting our youth.\u201d He fired the center\u2019s president and several board members, and the board voted to install Trump as president. He promised that \u201cthe best is yet to come\u201d for the center.\n\nTrump also signed an order aimed at eradicating the \u201canti-Christian weaponization of government,\u201d which cites the Biden Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 attempts to shut out Christians from the foster care system if they did not affirm gender ideology for children.\n\nAlso on his first day, Trump revoked nearly 100 of Biden\u2019s executive actions, including one preventing discrimination over \u201cgender identity.\u201d\n\nHis day one order also reverses a policy that allowed individuals to change the gender marker on their passports.\n\nDuring his remarks to Congress, Trump highlighted some of the eye-popping waste the Department of Government Efficiency is targeting, including transgender experiments on mice.\n\nTrump also recognized Women\u2019s History Month, saying, \u201cNo longer will our Government promote radical ideologies that replace women with men \u2026\u201d\n\nFederal judges have blocked many of Trump\u2019s actions, including the bans on child sex change procedures and trans-identifying troops, but the administration plans to continue fighting those decisions in court.",
