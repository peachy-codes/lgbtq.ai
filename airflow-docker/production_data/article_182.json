UVA Health in Charlottesville has suspended all so-called \u201cgender-affirming care\u201d while it reviews the guidance.\n\n\u201cLike many health systems across the country, the University of Virginia and UVA Health are working to analyze and interpret the federal order and related state guidance, as well as monitoring other potential policy changes and impacts to ensure we are always delivering care in accordance with the law,\u201d the hospital wrote.\n\nIn the nation\u2019s capital, Washington, D.C., Children\u2019s National Hospital \u201cpaused prescriptions of puberty blockers and hormone therapy to comply with the directives while we assess the situation further,\u201d according to NBC. The hospital has previously said it doesn\u2019t perform transgender surgeries on children.\n\nIn Illinois, Lurie Children\u2019s Hospital of Chicago said it is reviewing Trump\u2019s order and \u201cassessing any potential impact to the clinical services we offer to our patient families,\u201d according to the local outlet Fox59. The hospital statement added: \u201cOur team will continue to advocate for access to medically necessary care, grounded in science and compassion for the patient-families we are so privileged to serve.\u201d\n\nIn Pennsylvania, Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia also said it is \u201cclosely reviewing recent government actions, including the executive order on Jan. 28, to understand how they might impact care for the children who rely on [it].\u201d\n\nTrump signed an executive order during his second week in office protecting children from irreversible gender transition procedures, calling them a \u201cstain on our Nation\u2019s history.\u201d\n\nThe order describes the transgender procedures that doctors and activists have pushed upon children in recent years, and states that the United States will not fund, sponsor, promote, assist, or support the attempted gender transition of a child, promising that it will \u201crigorously enforce all laws that prohibit or limit these destructive and life-altering procedures.\u201d\n\n\u201cAcross the country today, medical professionals are maiming and sterilizing a growing number of impressionable children under the radical and false claim that adults can change a child\u2019s sex through a series of irreversible medical interventions,\u201d the order states. \u201cThis dangerous trend will be a stain on our Nation\u2019s history, and it must end.\u201d\n\n\u201cCountless children soon regret that they have been mutilated and begin to grasp the horrifying tragedy that they will never be able to conceive children of their own or nurture their children through breastfeeding,\u201d the order continues. \u201cMoreover, these vulnerable youths\u2019 medical bills may rise throughout their lifetimes, as they are often trapped with lifelong medical complications, a losing war with their own bodies, and, tragically, sterilization.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told The Daily Wire that Trump would \u201ccertainly\u201d support congressional efforts to protect children from transgender procedures.\n\n\u201cThe president has already taken a very strong stance on this issue this week with the signing of his executive order, a few executive orders in this space,\u201d she told The Daily Wire during Friday\u2019s press briefing.\n\n\u201cFirst, he made it the official policy of the federal government that there are only two sexes, male and female, and we have directed all federal agencies to comply with that policy,\u201d Leavitt explained. \u201cAs for congressional legislation to support the president\u2019s agenda in this space, and certainly ending the mutilation of young children, the chemical castration of young children, which is a barbaric practice that the vast majority of Americans do not support, for young, minor children, certainly, the president would support Congress\u2019 efforts, as he has already made that very clear this week.\u201d",
