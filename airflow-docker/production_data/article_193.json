She alleges she was told by administrators that if she tried to avoid changing with the trans student, she would risk being late to class. \n\n\"That was really my first experience in just knowing that something isn't right, but not knowing what to do with that,\" Carlisle told Fox News Digital in an exclusive interview. Fox News Digital has reached out to Presque Isle Middle School for comment.\n\nGender identity was first included in the Maine Human Rights Act as part of the definition of sexual orientation in 2005. In 2021, the law was amended to add gender identity as its own protected class, joining other protected classes such as sex, sexual orientation, disability, race, color and religion. The law specifically says that denying a person equal opportunity in athletic programs is education discrimination.\n\nBut for Carlisle, the transgender student in her gym class was only in the girls locker room for about a week, before mysteriously vanishing, Carlisle claims. But the memory of the experience still stuck with her. \ncassidy skiing\n\nMaine high school student Cassidy Carlisle skiing (Courtesy of Cassidy Carlisle)\n\nThe memory especially stuck with her in her junior year of high school, when she found out she would be competing with a trans athlete on the state Nordic skiing team. \n\nIt was an athlete with whom she was familiar. She had already lost to the trans athlete in cross-country competitions in previous years.\n\nWhen her father told her she would have to face the athlete again in skiing, Carlisle didn't believe it was happening. \n\n\"I was like, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s only something I kind of hear about on the news. \u2026 It\u2019s not going to happen to me,\" Cassidy recalled.\n\nMaine high school student Cassidy Carlisle running in a track event (Courtesy of Cassidy Carlisle)\n\nBut it did happen to her.\n\n\"The defeat that comes with that in that moment is heartbreaking,\" Carlisle said. \"I'm just in shock in a way. I didn't believe it. \u2026 I didn't think it was happening to me.\"\n\nAs a child, Carlisle quit her co-ed hockey team specifically because she felt she \"couldn't keep up\" with the boys. Then, even after committing to a girls-only sport, she couldn't escape the physical disadvantage that came with facing biological males. \n\nOn top of the anxiety of the situation, Carlisle felt like she couldn't speak out about it. \n\n\"I stayed silent for a while,\" Carlisle said. \"It's very hard to speak up if you don't have a platform to do it on. \u2026 Backlash is a huge thing. I'm a high school student. No high school student wants to be hurt or yelled at or said mean comments by people. And the reality of it, with the state that I live in, that could very much happen.\" \n\nWhat she could do was vote in the November election. As a first-time voter, she cast her ballot with the issue of trans athletes in girls sports at the forefront.\nTrump, Maine Gov. Janet Mills clash over executive order compliance Video\n\nA national exit poll conducted by the Concerned Women for America legislative action committee found that 70% of moderate voters saw the issue of \"Donald Trump\u2019s opposition to transgender boys and men playing girls and women\u2019s sports and of transgender boys and men using girls and women\u2019s bathrooms\" as important to them. \n\nAnd 6% said it was the most important issue of all, while 44% said it was \"very important.\"\n\nBut then when Republican Maine state Rep. Laurel Libby spoke out against another trans athlete who won a girls pole vault competition in February, Carlisle suddenly had an opportunity to influence the issue more directly.  \n\nLibby's social media post identifying the trans athlete thrust the entire state into an ongoing culture war. It became ground zero for a national battle over the issue waged by the Trump administration against several Democrat-controlled states like Maine after Trump signed an executive order to address the issue Feb. 5. \n\nAll of a sudden, thousands of people in Maine were speaking out against the state's laws that enable trans inclusion in girls sports and locker rooms, all with the backing of the president. \n\nSo Carlisle joined in. \nAG Bondi holds White House roundtable on preserving women\u2019s sports Video\n\nOn Feb. 27, Carlisle made a trip to the White House with several other current and former female athletes who have been affected by trans inclusion, including Payton McNabb and Selina Soule. There, they met with Attorney General Pam Bondi and several other state attorneys general and shared their stories. \n\nCarlisle couldn't help but notice an absence at the White House that day, \n\n\"None of our AGs were there from our state,\" Carlisle said. \n\nSo, when Carlisle returned to her state, she took matters into her own hands. \n\nLast weekend, she delivered a speech in front of the Maine Capitol, speaking to hundreds of other residents there to protest Gov. Janet Mills for her continued enabling of trans athletes in girls sports. \n\nIt was the second protest against Mills outside the Capitol in a month after the March on Mills rally March 1. \n\nThe Trump administration is taking aggressive measures to get the state to adhere to the wishes of Carlisle and other residents who want females protected from trans inclusion. \n\nOn March 17, the Health and Human Services Office of Civil Rights (OCR) announced that if found the Maine Department of Education, the Maine Principals' Association and Greely High School in violation of Title IX for continuing to enable trans inclusion in girls sports. \n\nIn the announcement, the department said Maine had 10 days to correct its policies through a signed agreement or risk referral to the U.S. Department of Justice for appropriate action.\n\nTrump has already shown a willingness to cut federal funding to enforce these policies. He paused $175 million in funding to the University of Pennsylvania and temporarily paused funding to the University of Maine System last week until a review had found the system was in full compliance with Trump's orders. \n\nThe deadline for the rest of Maine to comply is coming up within the week. \n\n\"I really hope that Maine complies because our schools need the federal funding, and we can't risk losing that,\" Carlisle said. \"It would really really hurt our state to lose that federal funding. So, I hope our government can get it together.\" ",
