Jerry Schillinger, who proposed the measure, said at Tuesday's meeting.\n\nThe lawmakers did not name names but implied that the rule was aimed at Democratic Rep. Zooey Zephyr, who was elected the state's first transgender legislator in 2022 and won a second term last month.\n\nThis wouldn't be Montana Republicans' first time singling out Zephyr: They voted in April 2023 to sanction and silence her from floor debates for breaking decorum, after she said lawmakers who supported a ban on gender-affirming healthcare for minors would have \"blood on your hands.\" (While her banishment ended with the 2023 session, she has yet to return since the legislature did not meet in 2024.) \"Understand that we have one representative right now but in the future, we could have many,\" Republican Rep. Jedediah Hinkle, a supporter of the measure, said on Tuesday. \"This could be an ongoing thing.\"\n\nDuring the nearly 15-minute discussion \u2014 in which no women participated \u2014 lawmakers in favor of the rule said it would safeguard women's spaces, while those opposed questioned its utility and how it would be enforced.\n\nCritics also maintained that the accommodations made during the legislature's last session \u2014 adding locks to the nearby bathrooms' outer doors \u2014 had already addressed members' concerns. And two Republican members worried that the measure itself would be a distraction. \"This particular action will have the effect of making people famous in the national news and will not contribute to the effective conduct of our business,\" said Republican Rep. David Bedey, who opposed the bill \"reluctantly\" despite his personal views on the topic.\n\nThe proposal, which needed support from a majority of both committees, passed in the Senate committee but ultimately failed in the House committee by a vote of 10-12. Zephyr celebrated the outcome on social media.\n\n\"I'm happy to see that this proposed ban failed and am grateful for my colleagues \u2014 particularly my republican colleagues \u2014 who recognized this as a distraction from the work we were elected to do,\" she posted on X. \"I'm ready to represent my constituents & look forward to working on behalf of Montana.\" A similar conversation has been playing out in Congress\nOn Tuesday, Hinkle \u2014 one of the Montana rule's Republican supporters \u2014 acknowledged that the issue has been in the national spotlight.\n\n\"I think it's time that this body addresses this issue now as they are addressing it nationally,\" he said.\n\nThe Montana measure came right after a similar conversation arose in the nation's Capital \u2014 but ended in a very different outcome. In early November, Democratic Rep.-elect Sarah McBride of Delaware became the first openly transgender person elected to Congress.\n\nWeeks later, Republican Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina introduced a measure that would ban transgender women from using facilities in the Capitol building that do not correspond with their sex at birth. Mace later followed up with legislation that would extend to all facilities on federal property.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson hasn't commented on a plan to vote on those measures, but released a clarification saying all single-sex facilities in the Capitol and House Office Buildings are \"reserved for individuals of that biological sex.\"\n\nMcBride \u2014 like many of her soon-to-be Democratic colleagues \u2014 criticized the ordeal as a distraction, but said she will comply with the rules Johnson outlined.\n\n\"I'm not here to fight about bathrooms,\" tweeted McBride, who will take office in January. \"I'm here to fight for Delawareans and to bring down costs facing families.\"",
