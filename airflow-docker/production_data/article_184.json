This article was originally published on July 22. \n\nElon Musk, the billionaire owner of Tesla and SpaceX, told Dr. Jordan B. Peterson that he was \u201ctricked into\u201d allowing one of his sons to undergo gender procedures, saying his child was \u201ckilled\u201d by the \u201cwoke mind virus.\u201d\n\nMusk sat down with Peterson for an interview that covered a range of topics and was streamed live on DailyWire+ and X. During one segment, Peterson and Musk discussed children being targeted by doctors with gender procedures, with both men agreeing that the practice is \u201cevil.\u201d Musk called \u201cgender-affirming care,\u201d the Left\u2019s description of the procedures, \u201ca terrible euphemism.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really child mutilation and sterilization,\u201d Musk said. \u201cIt\u2019s evil. You\u2019re taking kids who are far below the age of consent.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very possible for adults to manipulate children who are having an actual identity crisis into believing that they are the wrong gender,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cWhy are you willing to make this an issue?\u201d Peterson asked Musk, which led to the billionaire entrepreneur opening up about his son, Xavier, who struggled with gender dysphoria and now identifies as a girl.\n\n\u201cWell, it happened to one of my older boys,\u201d the Tesla and SpaceX owner replied. \u201cI was essentially tricked into signing documents for one of my older boys, Xavier. This was really before I had any understanding of what was going on, and we had COVID going on, so there was a lot of confusion. And I was told Xavier might commit suicide.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThat was a lie right from the outset,\u201d Peterson said. \u201cNo reliable clinician ever believed that. There was never any evidence for that, and also, if there is a higher suicide rate, the reason is the underlying depression and anxiety and not because of the gender dysphoria. And every god-d*** clinician knows that, too, and they\u2019re too cowardly to come out and say it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s incredibly evil,\u201d Musk said. \u201cAnd I agree with you that the people that are promoting this should go to prison.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was tricked into doing this. It wasn\u2019t explained to me that puberty blockers are actually just sterilization drugs,\u201d he added. \u201cI lost my son, essentially. They call it \u2018deadnaming\u2019 for a reason. The reason they call it \u2018deadnaming\u2019 is because your son is dead, so my son, Xavier, is dead, killed by the woke mind virus.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear that. I can\u2019t imagine what that would be like,\u201d Peterson told the billionaire entrepreneur.\n\n\u201cSo I vowed to destroy the woke mind virus after that,\u201d said Musk. \u201cAnd we\u2019re making some progress.\u201d\n\nIf you are having thoughts of suicide, call or text 988 to reach the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline or go to SpeakingOfSuicide.com/resources for a list of additional resources.",
