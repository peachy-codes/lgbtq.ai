  "content": "Two public school districts and several parents have sued Pennsylvania in a bid to undo antidiscrimination protections for gay and transgender people, saying the state\u2019s two-year-old regulation is illegal because it goes beyond what lawmakers intended or allowed.\n\nThe lawsuit comes amid a national debate over the rights of transgender high school athletes to compete in women\u2019s sports, and was filed in the statewide Commonwealth Court late Thursday.\n\nIf the lawsuit is successful, the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission would no longer be able to investigate complaints about discrimination involving sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression. The plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers also say a favorable ruling in court would bar transgender student athletes from competing in women\u2019s high school sports in Pennsylvania. The plaintiffs include two districts \u2014 South Side Area and Knoch, both in western Pennsylvania \u2014 and two Republican state lawmakers, Reps. Aaron Bernstine and Barbara Gleim, as well as three parents and seven students.\n\nThe lawsuit names Gov. Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, and the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission, which investigates complaints about discrimination because of someone\u2019s race, sex, religion, age or disability in housing, employment and public accommodations.\n\nShapiro\u2019s office said it had no immediate comment Friday, and the commission did not respond to an inquiry about the lawsuit Friday.\n\n\nThe lawsuit is aimed at the definition of sex discrimination, which the commission expanded by regulation to include sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression. The regulation was approved in late 2022 by a separate regulatory gatekeeper agency, and it took effect in 2023.\n\nThe plaintiffs contend that the state Supreme Court has interpreted the term \u201csex\u201d as used in the Pennsylvania Constitution to mean either male or female. They also contend that the state Legislature never gave permission to the Human Relations Commission to write regulations expanding the legal definition of sex discrimination, making the regulation a violation of the Legislature\u2019s constitutional authority over lawmaking.\n\nThe commission has justified the expanded definition by saying that state courts have held that Pennsylvania\u2019s antidiscrimination laws are to be interpreted consistently with federal antidiscrimination law. The commission can negotiate settlements between parties or impose civil penalties, such as back pay or damages.\n\nFor years, Democratic lawmakers tried to change the law to add the terms sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression to the portfolio of complaints that the Human Relations Commission could investigate. Every time, Republican lawmakers blocked the effort.\n\nShapiro, in the past, has backed the Democrats\u2019 legislation and in 2021 called GOP-backed legislation to prohibit transgender athletes from playing women\u2019s high school and college sports \u201ccruel.\u201d\n\nMost states have laws against discriminating against gay or transgender people in employment, housing and public accommodations or investigate such complaints, according to the Human Rights Campaign, which advocates for equality for LGBTQ people.",
