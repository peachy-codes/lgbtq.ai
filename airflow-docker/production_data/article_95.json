  "content": "January 7, 2024 \u2014 GLAAD, the world\u2019s largest lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) media advocacy organization, today responded after Meta removed and adapted several sections of its Hateful Conduct Policy, rolling back safety guardrails for LGBTQ people, people of color, women, immigrants, and other protected groups. These changes to the hateful conduct policy are in addition to news this morning that Meta will end its fact-checking program.\n\nToday\u2019s sweeping and extreme policy changes represent a wholesale abandonment of the norms and best practices of content moderation. The new language of Meta\u2019s Community Standards includes numerous changes that will result in Instagram, Facebook, and Threads becoming unsafe landscapes filled with dangerous hate speech, violence, harassment, and misinformation. \n\nGLAAD President and CEO Sarah Kate Ellis today responded to Meta\u2019s rollback:\n\n\u201cZuckerberg\u2019s removal of fact-checking programs and industry-standard hate speech policies make Meta\u2019s platforms unsafe places for users and advertisers alike. Without these necessary hate speech and other policies, Meta is giving the green light for people to target LGBTQ people, women, immigrants, and other marginalized groups with violence, vitriol, and dehumanizing narratives. With these changes, Meta is continuing to normalize anti-LGBTQ hatred for profit \u2014 at the expense of its users and true freedom of expression. Fact-checking and hate speech policies protect free speech.\u201d \n\nToday\u2019s announcement includes numerous alarming changes (many entirely overturning Meta\u2019s previous policies) to both allow anti-LGBTQ hateful rhetoric, and cease to protect LGBTQ users from being targeted with such attacks. Notably, the additions of the words \u201ctransgenderism\u201d (a hateful right wing neologism intended to imply that being trans is an ideology) and \u201chomosexuality\u201d (an outdated and pathologizing way of referring to LGBTQ people) are shocking red flags. \n\nStating that, \u201cOur policies are designed to allow room for these types of speech,\u201d Meta\u2019s new policies now expressly allow such anti-LGBTQ speech as: \u201cInsulting language in the context of discussing political or religious topics, such as when discussing transgender rights, immigration, or homosexuality\u201d and \u201callegations of mental illness or abnormality when based on gender or sexual orientation, given political and religious discourse about transgenderism [sic] and homosexuality\u2026\u2019\u201d Meta has also removed clauses prohibiting the following: \u201cthe usage of slurs that are used to attack people on the basis of their protected characteristics\u201d and \u201cSelf-admission to intolerance on the basis of protected characteristics, including but not limited to: homophobic, islamophobic, racist.\u201d\n\nThese are just a few of the many extreme new policies the company has adopted. These sweeping policy changes will harm not only the historically marginalized groups who have been stripped of protections \u2014 but all platform users who will be confronted with unmoderated, extremist rhetoric and hate.\n\nThe changes coincide with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s announcement that the company is ending its fact-checking program, and replacing it with a \u201ccommunity notes\u201d-style system. The company also stated that Meta will move its US-based content review team to Texas. In December, Zuckerberg said he seeks an \u201cactive role\u201d in shaping tech policy in the upcoming Trump administration.\n\nBelow are just some of the changes made to Meta\u2019s Hateful Conduct policies today: \n\nAllowances for attacks on LGBTQ people, women, and immigrants: Specifically, Meta now states: \u201cPeople sometimes use sex- or gender-exclusive language when discussing access to spaces often limited by sex or gender, such as access to bathrooms, specific schools, specific military, law enforcement, or teaching roles, and health or support groups. Other times, they call for exclusion or use insulting language in the context of discussing political or religious topics, such as when discussing transgender rights, immigration, or homosexuality. Finally, sometimes people curse at a gender in the context of a romantic break-up. Our policies are designed to allow room for these types of speech.\u201d\nAllowances for economic exclusion of women and transgender people: In its Economic exclusion clause, Meta now states \u201cWe do allow content arguing for gender-based limitations of military, law enforcement, and teaching jobs. We also allow the same content based on sexual orientation, when the content is based on religious beliefs.\u201d\nAllowances for social exclusion of women and transgender people: Meta states that it now allows for content advocating for \u201csex or gender-based exclusion from spaces commonly limited by sex or gender, such as restrooms, sports and sports leagues, health and support groups, and specific schools.\u201d\nAllowances for claims that LGBTQ people are mentally ill: Meta now states \u201cWe do allow allegations of mental illness or abnormality when based on gender or sexual orientation, given political and religious discourse about transgenderism [sic] and homosexuality and common non-serious usage of words like \u2018weird.\u2019\u201d Please see an explanation of \u201ctransgenderism,\u201d a rightwing neologism that is commonly used as an anti-trans dogwhistle.\nRemoval of prohibitions against dehumanization of protected groups \u2014 Previously, Meta prohibited \u201cDehumanizing speech in the form of comparisons to or generalizations about:\nInanimate objects: For example, \u201cwomen as household objects or property or objects in general \u2026 transgender or non-binary people as \u201cit.\u201d\nCriminals: For example, \u201cthieves,\u201d \u201cbank robbers,\u201d or saying \u201cAll [protected characteristic or quasi-protected characteristic] are \u2018criminals.\u201d\nRemoval of prohibition against statements denying existence \u2014 For example,  \u201c[protected characteristic(s) or quasi-protected characteristic] do not exist\u201d or \u201c[protected characteristic(s) or quasi-protected characteristic] shouldn\u2019t exist.\u201d\nReducing clarity on hate speech: Meta removes prohibitions on \u201cstatements of inferiority, expressions of contempt or disgust; cursing; and calls for exclusion or segregation.\u201d\nReducing clarity on Meta\u2019s definition of slurs: Previously, Meta defined slurs as speech \u201cused to attack people on the basis of their protected characteristics.\u201d\nReducing clarity on \u201cgeneralizations that state inferiority\u201d and \u201ccontempt,\u201d which Meta now calls \u201cinsults\u201d: Meta has now removed several sections of its policy that previously prohibited harassment regarding physical appearance, mental characteristics, and other statements of protected groups being \u201cworthless\u201d or \u201cfreaks.\u201d\nMeta has removed several definitions of \u201ccontempt,\u201d including \u201cintolerance on the basis of protected characteristics, including but not limited to: homophobic, islamophobic, racist.\u201d\nOther changes to Meta\u2019s hate speech policy include:\n\nTransitioning from the phrase \u201chate speech\u201d to \u201chateful conduct\u201d\nRemoval of Meta\u2019s previous acknowledgment that hate speech \u201ccreates an environment of intimidation and exclusion, and in some cases may promote offline violence.\u201d\nRemovals of additional restrictions for paid content\nThe current version of Meta\u2019s policies is here, and previous versions showing what has been changed can be found on the left-hand tabs.
