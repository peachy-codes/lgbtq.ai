  "content": "A Brooklyn transgender woman is mulling legal action against a New York City tennis league after she was barred from competing against other women following a complaint from a cisgender woman in the league.\n\nCammie Woodman, 25, says that the Tennis League Network\u2019s founder and CEO, Steven Chagnon, asked if he could move her to an \u201cappropriate level Men\u2019s Division\u201d in a March 26 email. Chagnon had forwarded her a separate email from the cisgender woman whom Woodman had beaten in a match the day prior. The woman referred to Woodman as a \u201cmale playing in a women\u2019s league.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m aware how controversial this issue is right now and I am sorry to put this on you but I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a way around the fact that it\u2019s unfair for me, or any other woman in this league, to play against a man under the pretense that he is a woman,\u201d the email read.\n\nLess than two hours after receiving the message and the forwarded complaint, Woodman replied to Chagnon, refusing his suggestion that she compete against men. \u201cUnfortunately, no, I am a transgender woman who has been medically transitioning for the past 4 years and can provide proof of this,\u201d she said in her reply. \u201cI believe in my integrity as a woman player, as I play women often and would not say that I dominate the competition by any means. I compete in local women\u2019s tournaments, and frankly, I have a mostly losing record. \u2026 If you decide that I cannot participate, I will take my money back.\u201d\n\nChagnon responded a few hours later. \u201cWhatever this is,\u201d he wrote, \u201cwe have zero interest in being involved. Everyone who is connected is getting refunded immediately and removed from the program.\u201d\n\nReading that email, Woodman says, it was as if her \u201cworst nightmare\u201d was coming true. She had read press coverage of other athletes facing mistreatment and exclusion for being trans. The moral panic about trans girls and women playing sports has reached such a fever pitch, stoked by right-wing pundits, activists, lawmakers, and elected officials, that even cisgender athletes like Olympic gold medalist Imane Khelif and Zambian soccer player Barbra Banda, a striker for the Orlando Pride, have been \u201caccused\u201d of being trans, subjected to harassment and bullying from everyday trolls and high-profile transphobes alike. Woodman knew that the campaign of exclusion could come for her someday. She just didn\u2019t think it would be that particular day.\n\n\u201cI had a physical reaction where I was crying and my legs were shaking,\u201d she tells Them, of seeing Chagnon\u2019s words on her screen. \u201cIt was hard to stand. I felt like I could have been pushed over. You could have knocked me down with a feather. It was unbelievable.\u201d\n\nThe experience was particularly jarring, Woodman says, because the actual match had been a pleasant one. Her competitor seemed inexperienced, and after Woodman beat her handily in 6-0, 6-2 sets, she says the two shook hands and exchanged light pleasantries. Woodman, who has been training for the past two and a half years, even offered to practice with her opponent in the future. \u201cI felt like this player wasn\u2019t at a level that was appropriate for the league in general, whether it was against me or any of the other girls,\u201d she tells Them over the phone.\n\nHaving begun playing tennis relatively early in her transition, Woodman feels that tennis is a lot like life, in that the biggest adversary you\u2019re facing is yourself. \u201cIf you lose a match in tennis, it\u2019s because of your own errors or something that you\u2019ve done, rather than someone just being too good,\u201d she says. \u201cI find that so inspirational. All we can focus on is what we have control over and what power we still have.\u201d\n\nWoodman wasn\u2019t the only player who was impacted by the Tennis League Network\u2019s decision to ban her from play. Other competitors who emailed on her behalf to protest the organization\u2019s move were also punished, per emails from the Tennis League Network reviewed by Them.\n\nIn that second email to Woodman, Chagnon said that \u201ceveryone who is connected\u201d to the incident would be \u201cremoved from the program,\u201d but Woodman believes that the woman who initially complained remains active in the league. (Them could not independently confirm that claim, as Chagnon and the Tennis League Network did not return numerous requests for comment.)\n\nAmong those who say they were also ejected from the league is Mel O\u2019Brien, 30, who received a separate email from Chagnon stating that Tennis League Network is \u201cjust a tennis league and we\u2019re not interested.\u201d \u201cIf there is another account involved, please let us know and we\u2019ll also just refund your fees,\u201d he wrote in the March 26 message.\n\nO\u2019Brien says that she does not regret sticking up for Woodman, whom she calls one of the most dedicated competitors that she\u2019s ever met. After playing alongside Woodman for years on the courts, O\u2019Brien says that she spoke out on her friend\u2019s behalf because what Woodman was experiencing was \u201cvery clearly discriminatory.\u201d She felt like she had a responsibility to say something, and she hopes that anyone else in her shoes would do the exact same thing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to find someone who\u2019s so dedicated to improving themselves in tennis,\u201d O\u2019Brien tells Them. \u201cEvery time Cammie steps on the court, she is playing at 110%. She puts so much into it, and she\u2019s such a kind person. No one deserves this kind of treatment, and Cammie, in particular, definitely did not deserve this type of treatment.\u201d\n\nThe incident drew national attention after Woodman shared screenshots of her exchange with Chagnon in a March 29 Instagram post calling on municipal officials to take action against Tennis League Network for \u201cviolating NYC human rights law.\u201d Since 2002, the New York City Human Rights Law has prohibited \u201cdiscriminatory harassment or violence motivated by a person\u2019s actual or perceived gender, gender identity, or gender expression\u201d in virtually all areas of public life, which would include recreational sports leagues. (The state has also had its own comprehensive trans civil rights law on the books since 2019.)\n\nThe Tennis League Network oversees 44 chapters in communities all over the country and bills itself as \u201cAmerica's recreational tennis playing population.\u201d The recreational league matches participants with other local players of similar skill levels. Chagnon has not responded to inquiries from multiple media outlets that have covered the story. Although the Network\u2019s national website lists rules of play, there is no mention of any policy affecting trans players. Similarly, the rules listed on the website for the organization\u2019s Brooklyn chapter make no mention of policies impacting trans players. Its website does note, however, that all the partners within the Tennis League Network\u2019s purview are non-competitive, and there is no cash reward or prize for winning.\n\nBut by operating within New York City, the Tennis League Network is obligated to follow local and state nondiscrimination ordinances. Although New York City officials have not commented on the specifics of Woodman\u2019s case, a spokesperson for the New York City Commission on Human Rights (NYCCHR) told Them that the city is \u201cwidely considered to have the broadest anti-discrimination protections in the country, safeguarding human rights for over 25 categories, including gender and gender identity, in housing, employment, and public accommodations.\u201d In a statement emailed to Them, the NYCHHR representative invited any individuals who have personally witnessed anti-trans bias to contact the agency.\n\nMeanwhile, the New York City\u2019s Parks Department, which oversees all public tennis courts in the five boroughs, said in an email that \u201cdiscrimination has no place in our city.\u201d \u201cOur public parks are spaces where all New Yorkers and visitors should feel welcome,\u201d a Parks Department representative told Them, noting that it has not yet renewed Tennis League Network\u2019s permits to use its facilities in 2025.\n\nWoodman confirmed that she is considering filing a complaint against the Tennis League Network, although she has yet to pursue any specific form of litigation. One of her prime motivations in doing so, she says, is to warn other trans people that, if this could happen to her, it could happen to anyone. Although the New York metropolitan area is often viewed as a liberal bubble, its progressivism is not absolute: The City School District of the City of New York debated a policy in March 2024 that would potentially restrict trans student athletics access, while Long Island\u2019s Nassau County enacted the state\u2019s first trans sports ban three months later.\n\n\u201cPeople need to know that this is happening and in a place where people would think they\u2019d be safe, like Brooklyn,\u201d Woodman says. \u201cNo trans athlete is safe from this kind of discrimination.\u201d\n\nThe scrutiny trans athletes face has only increased under the new presidential administration. Since taking office for his second term in January, U.S. President Donald Trump has issued a national executive order threatening to revoke federal funding from schools that allow trans student athletes to compete in accordance with their gender. The Trump administration is reportedly investigating a district in Portland, Oregon that has continued to affirm trans students in violation of White House policies, and it\u2019s attempting to threaten Maine into following Trump\u2019s orders. The USDA has already paused federal funding for some of the state\u2019s school programs, claiming that Maine is in violation of Title IX. State education officials have said they do not intend to capitulate, with the vocal backing of Maine\u2019s Democratic Governor Janet Mills.\n\nWhile Woodman says that she has faced some negative backlash after her story began gaining outside coverage in publications like Hell Gate and Newsweek, she says the public reaction has, for now, been largely positive. Other tennis leagues and even professional athletes have reached out to her to offer their support, including the Eastern division of the U.S. Tennis Association (USTA), which affirmed that \u201ctennis is for everyone\u201d in a comment on her Instagram page. \u201cSo sorry you\u2019re experiencing this, Cammie,\u201d the account for the eastern chapter of the United States Tennis Association, the sport\u2019s national governing body, wrote on March 28.\n\nWoodman says that the widespread approbation has only made her more dedicated to a sport that she says has changed her life. Tennis is where she finds strength, she says, and it\u2019s also where she feels her most beautiful. When she saw Serena Williams play in the last games of her storied career, Woodman says that she was transfixed by how the superstar athlete was simultaneously graceful and feminine and yet also powerful. Picking up a racket for the first time, Woodman recalls that it felt the same way that transitioning did: In learning to use her body in new ways that she hadn\u2019t ever even imagined that she could, she was evolving before her own eyes, and it was awe-inspiring to see.\n\nIn fighting for space for herself on the court, Woodman hopes to keep embodying multitudes. \u201cI\u2019ve always thought to myself: If this ever happened to me, I\u2019ll keep playing and play harder than ever,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd that\u2019s exactly what I feel like. The day after all of this went down, I went straight back to the court, and I played super well and super hard. That\u2019s what I'm going to keep doing.\u201d",
