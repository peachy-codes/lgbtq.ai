  "content": "Education Secretary Linda McMahon sent a \u201cDear Colleague\u201d letter to schools Friday warning of increased enforcement of parental rights.  \n\nThe letter comes following investigations conducted by the Department of Education against California and Maine over policies the federal agency alleges keep records of students\u2019 gender identity away from their parents, allegedly violating the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). FERPA gives parents a legal right to have access to all their children\u2019s educational records.  \n\n\u201cParents are the most natural protectors of their children. Yet many states and school districts have enacted policies that imply students need protection from their parents,\u201d McMahon said.  \n\n\u201cThese states and school districts have turned the concept of privacy on its head\u2014prioritizing the privileges of government officials over the rights of parents and wellbeing of families. Going forward, the correct application of FERPA will be to empower all parents to protect their children from the radical ideologies that have taken over many schools,\u201d she added.  The \u201cDear Colleague\u201d letter from the Student Privacy Policy Office also identifies \u201cpriority concerns\u201d for which the office is considering \u201cproactive measures\u201d to address.  \n\nThe concerns include schools that allegedly have policies that do not allow parents to see if the district comes up with a \u201cgender plan\u201d to support a transgender student and districts that are allegedly not annually notifying parents of their rights under FERPA. The letter and investigations into Maine and California over FERPA come as the Trump administration has implemented policies affecting transgender students and athletes.  The president signed an executive order barring transgender athletes from competing on the sports team they choose. Funding has also been paused to the University of Pennsylvania (Penn) and the University of Maine over alleged violations of that order. \n\nBoth schools have said they are following NCAA rules, which were changed to bar transgender athletes after President Trump\u2019s order.  \n\nThe investigations came after Republican backlash to Penn over a swimming controversy with a transgender student back in 2022. The University of Maine investigation began after a spat between Trump and Maine\u2019s governor over his order.  ",
