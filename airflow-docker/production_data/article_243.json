  "content": "Mt. Lebanon, Pa., is a leafy suburb south of Pittsburgh known for its quality of life and its fine public schools.\n\nAccording to the educators who sit on blue-ribbon panels, the school district is among the best in Pennsylvania if not the country. Its graduates attend elite universities. And parents move to the district for the schools, surveys say. My wife and I moved there 35 years ago for just this reason.\n\n    \u201cThere is no evidence in this [court] record of bullying, unkindness, or disrespect toward transgender students in the elementary school attended by the children of Plaintiffs.\u201d\n\nBut the vaunted Mt. Lebanon School District now finds itself on the losing end of a significant court decision over transgender education in its public schools. By embracing the radical idea that it was acceptable \u201cteacher prerogative\u201d to instruct first graders that their gender at birth could be wrong, the district staked out a position that was at odds with common decency, common sense, and common Christian conviction.\n\nThe case began when Megan Williams, a first-grade teacher in the district\u2019s Jefferson Elementary School spontaneously decided two years ago to observe Transgender Awareness Day by reading noncurricular books which presented gender identity topics to her students. She then told her first-grade students: \u201cwhen children are born, parents make a guess whether they\u2019re a girl or a boy. Sometimes parents are wrong.\u201d Some of the young children experienced confusion about how that topic personally affected them.\n\nDistrict Superintendent Timothy Steinhauer (who has since retired) testified in the lengthy court discovery that accompanied the case, it was longstanding practice within the district to honor opt outs on subjects parents found objectionable. But the opt outs and prior notice were \u201calways teacher prerogative.\u201d\n\nSteinhauer testified: \u201cWe [the District] don\u2019t have any specific guidelines for what you should notify parents about and not notify parents about.\u201d Steinhauer confirmed there were no written procedures on how or whether to notify parents.\n\nBut in this instance, past precedent was ignored. Parents were not notified or given the option to opt out. The district unequivocally backed teacher Williams\u2019 own personal preference, which was colored by the fact that her own child of the same age was transitioning from boy to girl at the same time.\n\nOne former Mt. Lebanon teacher who still lives in the district finds the conduct the case revealed bewildering and appalling. \u201cI\u2019m glad the judge sided with the plaintiffs, but I am appalled at the school district,\u201d she writes. \u201cThis is not the Mt. Lebanon that I grew up in, graduated from, raised my children in and taught in.\u201d (READ MORE: Let\u2019s Just Say It: Transgenderism Is a Mental Illness)\n\n\u201cWhen I retired from Mt. Lebanon, the school district ALWAYS sided with the parents,\u201d she adds. \u201cWe had to be so careful about what we said. This is just unbelievable. I am very disappointed in this town. Mt. Lebanon was always a conservative community. I\u2019m very sorry to hear how Mt Lebanon has changed.\u201d\n\nLikewise, it\u2019s not a district my wife or I recognize anymore. I suspect, however, that\u2019s a sentiment widely shared by many citizens across America whose trust in community schools has been shattered.\n\nAs in many liberal enclaves, the prevailing ethos in Mt. Lebanon now puts great emphasis on \u201cinclusivity.\u201d But as the case made clear, their inclusivity is meant only for politically acceptable minority groups. Christians now are perhaps in the minority in our community. If you espouse a Christian worldview, as did the three courageous moms who sued the school district, that is unacceptably intolerant.\n\nIn this regard, Mt. Lebanon has changed radically in the time we\u2019ve lived there. It\u2019s not quite Berkeley (California) yet, but it has moved inexorably in that direction. While the Lebo electorate was mostly Republican when we moved here, the school board hasn\u2019t had a Republican elected to it in more than a decade.\n\nAnd despite the rhetoric of \u201ctolerance\u201d expressed on yard signs and at cocktail parties, in the higher social strata, the only acceptable tolerance is that of the liberal persuasion. On the school board at least, if you cling to your Bible, you are considered deplorable and decidedly persona non grata.\n\nThis transition of America \u2014 from true tolerance to a widespread embrace of cancel culture, in both urban and suburban settings, even in an outwardly friendly place like Mt. Lebanon that supposedly espouses tolerance \u2014 has been well documented by academics on the fringes of the academy, where the transition is most radical.\n\nTheologian Carl Trueman, of Grove City College, has written persuasively on the role \u201cexpressive individualism\u201d plays now in the social dynamic of towns like Mt. Lebanon. Tolerance and inclusivity mean not just living quietly and peacefully as a trans person, but changing the pronoun usage of everyone else to conform to your expressive identity.\n\nConsider what happened in a Virginia public school district. The school board recently agreed to pay $575,000, after years of litigation, to settle with Peter Vlaming, a high school French teacher whose employment was terminated in 2018 for refusing to use male pronouns for a transgender student. Vlaming had tried to avoid pronouns altogether and used the student\u2019s preferred name, but was fired after \u201caccidentally\u201d using a feminine pronoun. Vlaming sued, and the Viriginia Supreme Court ruled that his rights were violated.\n\n\u201cI was wrongfully fired from my teaching job because my religious beliefs put me on a collision course with school administrators who mandated that teachers ascribe to only one perspective on gender identity \u2014 their preferred view,\u201d Vlaming said. He was represented in his lawsuit by the Alliance Defending Freedom.\n\nSocial commentator Aaron Renn, author of Life in the Negative World, describes how Christians in this dynamic are treated now in the \u201cnegative world.\u201d \u201cIn this era,\u201d Renn writes, \u201csociety has an overall negative view of Christianity. Being known as a Christian is a social negative, particularly in the higher domains of society. Christian morality is expressly repudiated and now seen as a threat to the public good and new public moral order.\u201d\nFederal Court Weighs in On Trans Instruction\n\nOn Sept. 30, Joy Flowers Conti, the senior federal judge in the Western Pennsylvania district court who oversaw the lengthy school court case, issued her decision.\n\nUntil the judge\u2019s ruling, Williams\u2019 own personal and subjective standard of gender fluidity and identity was the only acceptable pedagogy on transgender instruction in the Mt. Lebanon School District. When parents objected, administrators treated the parents as religious fanatics, and backed the teacher\u2019s conduct without question or inquiry. The three moms then filed a federal lawsuit, claiming their constitutional rights were violated.\n\nIt was a David vs. Goliath legal contest which ended, incredibly, in ignominious and embarrassing defeat for the school district. By issuing a summary judgment, Judge Conti said there was no need for a trial because there was nothing for a jury to decide.\n\nAs a matter of law, the judge writes in her opinion that the district and its attorneys didn\u2019t understand the law as applied and interpreted in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit (based in Philadelphia, which includes Western Pennsylvania).\n\nA lawsuit that got scant local attention ended abruptly (local news outlets ignored it almost entirely, but the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette recently covered the story.) Ironically, a case the school district dealt with dismissively \u2014 it twice submitted petitions to the judge to have the complaint thrown out \u2014 turned out to be a huge win for parental, religious, and constitutional rights in public schools. (READ MORE: What We\u2019re Learning From Pushing Back Against the Trans Crowd)\n\nSummary judgment was entered in favor of all three plaintiffs and against the teacher, three administrators, and the district itself. There were no financial penalties asked for or assessed, but the district will likely be held liable for all of the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney fees and costs.\n\nAs part of her ruling, Judge Conti issued a meticulous 94-page opinion that is must reading for anyone concerned with the drift towards radical activism that now pervades many public schools. Within the 94 pages are the cultural signposts of our modern times.\n\nOn page 2, Judge Conti dismisses the \u201ckindness, tolerance, and respect\u201d argument so prevalent among transgender activists.\n\n\u201cThere is no evidence in this [court] record of bullying, unkindness, or disrespect toward transgender students in the elementary school attended by the children of Plaintiffs,\u201d Judge Conti writes. \u201cThis case involves different beliefs about gender identity.\u201d\n\nOne of the parents who objected to Williams\u2019 instruction was Roman Catholic. A second was Mormon and the third religiously unaffiliated but morally motivated. Of the three moms, only one still lives in the district. According to her attorney, she continues to be ostracized and cancelled by some in the community.\n\n\u201cThe Parents disagree that gender is a subjective, individual choice. They assert that gender is objective, immutable and determined by God and biology,\u201d Judge Conti writes.\n\nOn page 19 of her opinion, Judge Conti relates a telling exchange which presaged the controversy.\n\nOn Oct. 1, 2021, six months before the events occurred which triggered the lawsuit, a Mt. Lebanon parent (\u201cnot a party to this case\u201d) wondered how Jefferson Elementary School might memorialize LBGTQ month after reading about it in the school newsletter. The parent asked in an email to the school principal: \u201cI was wondering if/how this is acknowledged in the first grade because I am not comfortable with my daughter learning about gender identity at this age.\u201d\n\nBrett Bielewicz, the school principal, replied: \u201cThere is no formal introduction or lessons surrounding it at [Jefferson Elementary School], especially in 1st grade. It\u2019s just merely an acknowledgment of inclusivity and awareness to our JES community.\u201d\n\nNothing formal, but informally yes, as parents in the school would soon discover.\n\nThe events that triggered the lawsuit began on March 30, 2022, when Megan Williams, a former student in the district who teaches first grade at Jefferson Elementary School, sent a text to two fellow teachers which read: \u201cTomorrow is international trans day of visibility. I\u2019d like to read something.\u201d\n\nShe was acting on impulse born of personal circumstance. Williams\u2019 child (a biological boy who was the same age as the first graders in her class) changed to using female pronouns the same week that Williams read two transgender books to her first-grade class on \u201cinternational trans day.\u201d\n\nOn that day, the books were read and discussed. If it had stopped there, Williams may have gotten away unscathed.\n\nBut after telling students that she\u2019d like to bring her child to school in a month for Take Your Child to Work Day (which teachers were not permitted to do), Williams told students that her boy was now a girl, and she\u2019d be wearing a dress to school. She then told the first graders \u201cwhen children are born, parents make a guess whether they\u2019re a boy or a girl. Sometimes parents are wrong.\u201d\n\nOne confused child raised his hand and said: \u201cBut I\u2019m a boy. I don\u2019t want to be a girl.\u201d The aide in the class testified that the student was \u201cupset.\u201d Williams responded, \u201cYes you are. Talk with your parents about that.\u201d\n\nIn more than two years of litigation, the district (whose board president is himself an attorney) steadfastly maintained in repeated court filings that the parents not only had no case; they had no rights as parents to opt their first graders out of transgender instruction.\n\nThat argument \u2014 that \u201cteacher prerogative\u201d in the district trumped any and all parental rights \u2014 was specious, legal observers say. Judge Conti was equally skeptical.\n\nShe writes:\n\n    Throughout this litigation, [the district and its administrators] have taken the position that in a public school, parents have no constitutional right to notice or to opt their children out of any kind of instruction, regardless of the content of that instruction, the age of the children, or whether the instruction is part of the published school curriculum.\u2026That is simply not the law within the Third Circuit.\n\nShe continues:\n\n    Refusing to provide opt outs for parents who assert religious and fundamental parental rights objections to transgender instruction to young children, while providing notice and opt out rights for other sensitive secular and religious topics, constitutes disparate treatment and violates the Equal Protection clause.\n\nThough few local citizens seemingly know of the case (due to the news coverage blackout), what made it such a lightning rod is that first graders were involved.\n\n\u201cWho decides how to determine a young child\u2019s gender identity goes to the heart of parental decision-making authority on a matter of greatest importance,\u201d Judge Conti writes.\n\nShe further observes: \u201cConcerns about undercutting parental authority are heightened when the children are in first grade and the person trying to influence them is their teacher.\u201d\n\nAnd court testimony clearly demonstrated that teacher Williams was not the least bit repentant. She believed \u201cI\u2019m in the right here!\u201d and \u201cthat she was free to instruct the young, captive students in her class in accordance with her beliefs without giving parents prior notice or an opportunity to opt their children out of that instruction,\u201d Judge Conti writes.\n\nIn any other context, this would be called indoctrination. But because it occurred in a Mt. Lebanon public elementary school, and was a type of indoctrination the school board endorsed, it is considered exhibiting \u201ctolerance\u201d and \u201crespect.\u201d That\u2019s how the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette framed it in this column (in fairness to the PG, they did publish my rebuttal).\n\nOf note, Judge Conti drew a sharp contrast with how principal Bielewicz dealt with the parents\u2019 complaint compared to another situation that arose at the school.\n\nIn the fall of 2022, after the lawsuit had been filed over the first-grade transgender instruction, a German teacher in the same school was doing some introductory instruction to a fifth-grade class about family-related words in German. In response to one student\u2019s question, the teacher was alleged to have told the class, \u201cI understand biology, and there\u2019s always one mother and there\u2019s always one father.\u201d\n\nAfter discussing this incident with Assistant Superintendent Marybeth Irvin, Bielewicz, the school\u2019s principal, interviewed every student in the class to assess the damage that had been done to the students.\n\nBy contrast, Williams\u2019 earlier violation, the judge noted in her opinion, was not investigated by either Bielewicz or the district.\n\nThe judge writes: \u201cBielewicz characterized the Parents\u2019 position as merely objecting to Williams\u2019 reading books.\u2026 The adult aides in Williams\u2019 classroom were not interviewed or consulted at all.\u2026 The administrators made public statements in support of Williams.\u201d\n\nThis pattern of discrimination on transgender topics explains why the judge ruled as she did.\n\nWhile parents were not provided any advance notice or the ability to opt their children out from Williams\u2019 outburst on March 31, teachers within the district had on prior occasions provided advance notice and opt outs to students participating in routine activities, including: the Scripps Spelling Bee; dissecting animals in biology; viewing video clips from a television series involving a gay character; and an assembly featuring a therapy dog.\nWill Anything Change?\n\nReturning to the chronology of events: when one of the plaintiff parents (Carmilla Tatel) met with school principal Bielewicz on April 5, 2022 to raise concerns about Williams\u2019 conduct, he could not guarantee that Williams wouldn\u2019t teach the transgender content again.\n\nAccording to the court record, Bielewicz had sent an email to Williams the day before which read: \u201cYou got tons of support from top down \u2014 trust me!\u201d\n\nHe was right. Incredibly, everyone in the chain of command \u2014 Assistant Superintendent Irvin, Superintendent Steinhauer, and School Board President Jacob Wyland \u2014 expressed public affirmation for Williams and her actions.\n\nNo one was disciplined then, nor even now (one shortcoming of the ruling, in my view). Williams and Bielewicz still work at Jefferson. Steinhauer and Irvin are retired, while Wyland still heads the school board.\n\nUntil recently, Bielewicz\u2019s public message as Jefferson\u2019s principal read as follows: \u201cI thank you in advance for allowing me the opportunity to \u2018be the change we wish to see in our world!\u2019\u201d\n\nAs part of the judge\u2019s ruling, change will finally be enforced on him and others in the district. After more than two years of litigation, Mt. Lebanon schools have been ordered to give parents advance notice and opt out of transgender instruction. The total cost of this fiasco to community taxpayers has not been revealed.\n\n\u201cWe are pleased that Judge Conti did a detailed examination of the facts and the law, and confirmed what we have said from the start: parental rights and beliefs matter in public education and cannot be disregarded or ignored. We are hopeful the District now understands that and will act accordingly,\u201d says the victorious Pittsburgh attorney David Berardinelli, who very ably represented the plaintiffs.\n\nWill the Mt. Lebanon School District act accordingly in the future? The people who run it haven\u2019t done anything sensible or truly tolerant since the start of this sad affair, so I have my doubts.\n\nA decision on whether the district will appeal the decision is expected on Oct. 21, when the school board meets. Although an appeal might seem ill-advised under the circumstances, modern standards of \u201ctolerance\u201d dictate that it may.",

She believed \u201cI\u2019m in the right here!\u201d and \u201cthat she was free to instruct the young, captive students in her class in accordance with her beliefs without giving parents prior notice or an opportunity to opt their children out of that instruction,\u201d Judge Conti writes.\n\nIn any other context, this would be called indoctrination. But because it occurred in a Mt. Lebanon public elementary school, and was a type of indoctrination the school board endorsed, it is considered exhibiting \u201ctolerance\u201d and \u201crespect.\u201d That\u2019s how the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette framed it in this column (in fairness to the PG, they did publish my rebuttal).\n\nOf note, Judge Conti drew a sharp contrast with how principal Bielewicz dealt with the parents\u2019 complaint compared to another situation that arose at the school.\n\nIn the fall of 2022, after the lawsuit had been filed over the first-grade transgender instruction, a German teacher in the same school was doing some introductory instruction to a fifth-grade class about family-related words in German. In response to one student\u2019s question, the teacher was alleged to have told the class, \u201cI understand biology, and there\u2019s always one mother and there\u2019s always one father.\u201d\n\nAfter discussing this incident with Assistant Superintendent Marybeth Irvin, Bielewicz, the school\u2019s principal, interviewed every student in the class to assess the damage that had been done to the students.\n\nBy contrast, Williams\u2019 earlier violation, the judge noted in her opinion, was not investigated by either Bielewicz or the district.\n\nThe judge writes: \u201cBielewicz characterized the Parents\u2019 position as merely objecting to Williams\u2019 reading books.\u2026 The adult aides in Williams\u2019 classroom were not interviewed or consulted at all.\u2026 The administrators made public statements in support of Williams.\u201d\n\nThis pattern of discrimination on transgender topics explains why the judge ruled as she did.\n\nWhile parents were not provided any advance notice or the ability to opt their children out from Williams\u2019 outburst on March 31, teachers within the district had on prior occasions provided advance notice and opt outs to students participating in routine activities, including: the Scripps Spelling Bee; dissecting animals in biology; viewing video clips from a television series involving a gay character; and an assembly featuring a therapy dog.\nWill Anything Change?\n\nReturning to the chronology of events: when one of the plaintiff parents (Carmilla Tatel) met with school principal Bielewicz on April 5, 2022 to raise concerns about Williams\u2019 conduct, he could not guarantee that Williams wouldn\u2019t teach the transgender content again.\n\nAccording to the court record, Bielewicz had sent an email to Williams the day before which read: \u201cYou got tons of support from top down \u2014 trust me!\u201d\n\nHe was right. Incredibly, everyone in the chain of command \u2014 Assistant Superintendent Irvin, Superintendent Steinhauer, and School Board President Jacob Wyland \u2014 expressed public affirmation for Williams and her actions.\n\nNo one was disciplined then, nor even now (one shortcoming of the ruling, in my view). Williams and Bielewicz still work at Jefferson. Steinhauer and Irvin are retired, while Wyland still heads the school board.\n\nUntil recently, Bielewicz\u2019s public message as Jefferson\u2019s principal read as follows: \u201cI thank you in advance for allowing me the opportunity to \u2018be the change we wish to see in our world!\u2019\u201d\n\nAs part of the judge\u2019s ruling, change will finally be enforced on him and others in the district. After more than two years of litigation, Mt. Lebanon schools have been ordered to give parents advance notice and opt out of transgender instruction. The total cost of this fiasco to community taxpayers has not been revealed.\n\n\u201cWe are pleased that Judge Conti did a detailed examination of the facts and the law, and confirmed what we have said from the start: parental rights and beliefs matter in public education and cannot be disregarded or ignored. We are hopeful the District now understands that and will act accordingly,\u201d says the victorious Pittsburgh attorney David Berardinelli, who very ably represented the plaintiffs.\n\nWill the Mt. Lebanon School District act accordingly in the future? The people who run it haven\u2019t done anything sensible or truly tolerant since the start of this sad affair, so I have my doubts.\n\nA decision on whether the district will appeal the decision is expected on Oct. 21, when the school board meets. Although an appeal might seem ill-advised under the circumstances, modern standards of \u201ctolerance\u201d dictate that it may.",
