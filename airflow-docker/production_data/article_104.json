The Trump Administration has erased trans people from the stonewall national monument website\u2026 we will not allow Trump and his hatemongers to redefine our communities or our history!\u201d\n\nThe rally was hosted by Jay W. Walker, a co-founder of the Reclaim Pride Coalition.

This blatant act of erasure not only distorts the truth of our history, but it also dishonors the immense contributions of transgender individuals \u2014 especially transgender women of color \u2014 who were at the forefront of the Stonewall Riots and the broader fight for LGBTQ+ rights. \n\n\u201cLet us be clear: Stonewall is transgender history. Marsha P. Johnson, Sylvia Rivera, and countless other trans and gender-nonconforming individuals fought bravely, and often at great personal risk, to push back against oppressive systems. Their courage, sacrifice, and leadership were central to the resistance we now celebrate as the foundation of the modern LGBTQ+ rights movement.\n\n\u201cThis decision to erase the word \u2018transgender\u2019 is a deliberate attempt to erase our history and marginalize the very people who paved the way for many victories we have achieved as a community. It is a direct attack on transgender people, especially transgender women of color, who continue to face violence, discrimination, and erasure at every turn.\n\n\u201cWe demand the immediate restoration of the word \u2018transgender\u2019 on the Stonewall National Monument website. We will not stand by while the legacies of our transgender siblings are erased from the history books.
