Rowling, who, last week, celebrated with cigars aboard a yacht after successfully leading a campaign to strip trans women of their rights in Britain.\n\nOne user claimed that they had even asked Rowling to fund the Ovarit venture, but that Rowling\u2019s office had replied in the negative. \u201cJK Rowling is not just a random woman in this case,\u201d user AngrySloth wrote. \u201cShe's a key player [...] she's using both her money and her platform to stop the gender madness.\u201d\n\n\nApril 16, 2025 \u2014 J.K.

Reddit cracked down on hate speech, including the anti-trans subreddit r/GenderCritical\u2014the preferred name for a particular kind of anti-trans zealotry. This coincided with the mass bans of subreddits dedicated to other forms of hate as well, such as racism or antisemitism.\n\nOvarit was a private, invite-only community, but its cult following was potent and prolific among \u201cgender critical\u201d advocates, who are also often known as \u201cTERFs.\u201d\n\n\u201cTERF\u201d means a \u201ctrans-exclusionary radical feminist\u201d. The Cambridge Dictionary defines a \u201cTERF\u201d as someone who believes \u201cthat feminism should not include supporting the rights of transgender people.\u201d Some TERFs embrace the term, and others regard it as a slur.\n\nOvarit and its precursor, r/GenderCritical, \u201cmake the internet another dangerous place for trans women through doxing and harassment,\u201d The Atlantic reported in 2020.\n\nWhile the real identities of most r/GenderCritical and Ovarit administrators do not appear to be public information, there is some carryover in leadership. Now, many Ovarit users are saying they will flee to smaller websites\u2014Cekni, Saidit, Spinster\u2014which are either TERF-owned or TERF-friendly.\n\nIt is not immediately clear how many Ovarit users were active at the time of its demise, but in 2020, Ovarit self-reported \u201c2,500 registered users,\u201d and at least one occasion where, over the course of a day, they \u201chosted over 7,000 unique visitors, almost 100 new posts and 1,200 comments.\u201d\n\nWhat is Ovarit\u2019s legacy?\n\nAs outlined in a report published last week, Erin in the Morning\u2019s investigation found that the Ovarit community helped shepherd fringe internet ideas into mainstream thought and consequential action. Two websites with ties to the Ovarit community, HeCheated and SheWon, have cumulatively compiled a centralized list of hundreds, if not thousands, of presumed-trans women and girl athletes.\n\nThese lists surveil competitions ranging from the Olympic level down to local children\u2019s leagues. They include triathlons and powerlifting as well as sports like darts and poker. They also feature a section for non-athletic events too, targeting presumed-trans prom queens and hot dog eating contest winners. And they grew directly from Ovarit\u2019s forums.\n\nLike Ovarit, SheWon and HeCheated are anonymously-run. They also appear inaccurate. Their inclusion of decidedly non-trans athletes, such as boxer Imane Khelif, further demonstrates how the trans moral panic harms people of all genders and sexes.\n\nJohn Oliver\u2019s \u201cLast Week Tonight\u201d and Erin in the Morning\u2019s own separate investigations of the registries showed they were misleading at best and flat out false at worst. Nonetheless, these public lists, which often include the full names, schools and links to photos of student athletes, have been weaponized by lawmakers and pundits across the country, fueling the far-right campaigns of Alabama\u2019s Republican Senator Tommy Tuberville, anti-trans activist Riley Gaines, and more.\n\nA representative for HeCheated, who declined to reveal their identity, told Erin in the Morning that an individual can be removed from the list only after providing the anonymous group with proof that they have ovaries.\n\nOvarit\u2019s final days might come as a welcome albeit small victory. But make no mistake: Extremist \u201cgender critical\u201d ideology and TERFdom are not going away. On the contrary, it may be in part that they don\u2019t need cloak-and-dagger, back-alley forums for their hate anymore.\n\nOn April 3, YouTube quietly removed \u201cgender identity\u201d from hate speech policy. Last week, the oversight board for Meta\u2014which owns Facebook and Instagram\u2014told content moderators they should no longer remove many types of anti-trans posts. And Tiktok, like most all of the social networks, has reportedly been using an algorithm that pushes far-right, anti-LGBT content. Even the New York Times platformed the numbers from the anonymous, debunked HeCheated list. What was once on the fringes of hate is now out in the open.\n\nIn a tearful farewell post, user grrrandma said they felt Ovarit had played a pivotal role in the landscape of anti-trans politics today. \u201cIt\u2019s a different world now than it was four or so years ago when this site was founded,\u201d they said. \u201cSo many more people now understand the harms of transgenderism, and it\u2019s much more acceptable to TERF out on main. Ovarit helped make that change happen and I\u2019m proud of what we accomplished here.\u201d",
