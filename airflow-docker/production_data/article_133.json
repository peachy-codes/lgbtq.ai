The home is part of A New Way of Life\u2019s SAFE Housing Network, a national collective providing safe reentry housing to formerly incarcerated people, and will welcome up to four women at a time, according to local outlet The Atlanta Voice.\n\nMadison first announced the house\u2019s opening at last year\u2019s NAESM conference. She told Gaye Magazine that when she moved out of the house, she decided to repurpose it to help support and foster community for other Black trans women.\n\n\u201cI wanted to use this house as a conduit for girls to become great,\u201d she said. \u201cI was a girl that was disenfranchised and homeless and was in sex work, and so many great things have happened in this house\u2026 I want people to understand that it\u2019s not where you start, it\u2019s where you go.\u201d\n\nNAESM, Inc.\u2019s official website describes the Ts Madison Starter House as \u201ca transformative investment in the future of Black trans women.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are building a model of care, economic empowerment, and long-term sustainability that ensures Black Trans people have access to safe housing, affirming healthcare, economic opportunities, and holistic support,\u201d the website continues.\n\nIn partnership with NAESM, the house will offer its residents healthcare, wellness services, psychological support, and workshops focusing on project management and business plan development. Residents of the house are referred to as \u201cstakeholders,\u201d in reference to their own role in the larger Black queer and trans liberation movement, per Black Enterprise.\n\n\nA 2011 National LGBTQ Task Force survey found that half (47%) of Black transgender people have been incarcerated at some point in their lives, compared to 16% of trans people and 21% of trans women in general. These incarceration rates are driven by Black trans people being disproportionately impacted by economic instability. According to the 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey, Black trans Americans face an unemployment rate (20%) four times higher than the general population and a poverty rate (38%) three times higher than the general population.\n\n\u201cIn the face of erasure, we still find solutions,\u201d trans actress and activist Monroe Alise said during the house\u2019s grand opening, per The Atlanta Voice. \u201cThey are trying to erase Black trans and nonbinary individuals throughout the country, the 1%.
