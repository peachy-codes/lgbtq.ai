Richardson, also known as Autumn Cordellion\u00e8, who was convicted of strangling his 11-month-old stepdaughter to death in 2001.\n\nIndiana law, however, prohibits the Department of Corrections from using taxpayer dollars to fund sex reassignment surgeries for inmates. However, the ACLU argues in the lawsuit, filed on Aug. 28, 2023, that the law is a violation of the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition of \"cruel and unusual punishment.\"\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) sued the Indiana Department of Corrections on behalf of a transgender inmate, Jonathan C.
