Janet Mills at a National Governors Association gathering. At the event, Mills publicly refused to comply with Trump\u2019s executive order against trans youth in school sports, which threatens to withdraw federal funding from states that maintain inclusive policies.\n\nOnly four days later, in a document later obtained by ABC affiliate WMTW, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) notified Mills and Maine Attorney General Aaron Frey that the state Department of Education was found to have violated Title IX.\n\nThe document \u2014 signed by Anthony Archeval, acting director of the Office of Civil Rights (OCR) \u2014 claims that the Maine Department of Education currently \u201cviolates Title IX by denying female student athletes in the State of Maine an equal opportunity to participate in\u201d school athletics, because of the possible inclusion of trans girls.\n\nOffering \u201cadditional opportunity\u201d for people who \u201cassert a \u2018gender identity\u2019 different from their sex, constitutes discrimination on the basis of gender identity, against students who identify as their sex,\u201d the document continues. Archeval\u2019s letter also explicitly casts aside discussion of trans boys, asserting that cis boys \u201care not subject to heightened safety or competitive concerns\u201d in sports.\n\nAbsent from the document is any record of an official investigation, which would usually include interviewing witnesses and collecting evidence over the course of weeks or months. Instead, Archeval\u2019s letter referenced two news stories alleging that two trans girls have participated in high school sports in Maine. One of the stories \u2014 published on OutKick, a right-wing sports website known for negative coverage of trans athletes \u2014 focused on allegations that a trans girl placed third and fourth in competitive skiing events. The other was based on a Facebook post last month by Maine Republican Rep. Laurel Libby, in which Libby posted photos of a high schooler she claimed was trans and had recently won a track meet.\n\nThe identity of that student has not been publicly confirmed, though the named high school temporarily increased security in the days after Libby\u2019s post. Libby has since been censured by the state House of Representatives, but refused to apologize this week.\n\nDanna Hayes, a spokesperson for A.G. Frey\u2019s office, told the Portland Press Herald that \u201cthere is no pending litigation\u201d against the state regarding Title IX. Hayes also told the Bangor Daily News that \u201c[n]o action has been taken yet\u201d by the federal government in regards to stripping funding from the state Department of Education, as Trump threatened. Mills\u2019 office declined to comment to reporters this week, directing press to the governor\u2019s previous statement, in which she said \u201cthe outcome of this politically directed investigation is all but predetermined.\u201d\n\nSince taking office in January, Trump has sought to eliminate civil rights for trans people in numerous areas, particularly the rights of trans minors to participate in school sports and receive gender-affirming medical care.
