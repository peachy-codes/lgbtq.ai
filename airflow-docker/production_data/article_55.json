  "content": "A growing number of prominent companies have scaled back or set aside the diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives that much of corporate America endorsed following the protests that accompanied the Minneapolis police killing of George Floyd, a Black man, in 2020.\n\nThe changes have come in response to a campaign by conservative activists to target workplace programs in the courts and social media, and more recently, President Donald Trump\u2019s executive orders aimed at upending DEI policies in both the federal government and private sector.\n\nDEI policies typically are intended to root out systemic barriers to the advancement of historically marginalized groups in certain fields or roles. Critics argue that some education, government and business programs are discriminatory because they single out participants based on factors such as race, gender and sexual orientation. They have targeted corporate sponsorships, employee-led affinity groups, programs aimed at steering contracts to minority or women-owned businesses, and goals that some companies established for increasing minority representation in leadership ranks. While hiring or promotion decisions based on race or gender is illegal under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act in most circumstances, companies say they are not doing that. Instead, they say they aspire to diversify their workforce over time through policies like widening candidate pools for job openings.\n\nThese are some of the companies that have retreated from DEI: Uber\nAfter an conducting an internal investigation that found rampant sexual harassment issues within its corporate office under its founder and former CEO Travis Kalanick, Uber has been focused on overhauling its corporate culture since its current CEO Dara Khosrowshahi took over in 2017.\n\nThose changes had included a ramped-up commitment to diversity and inclusion as part of a commitment that the ride-hailing service highlighted in a section of its annual report for 2023.\n\nBut Uber dropped its diversity and inclusion section from its 2024 annual report filed last month. And the word \u201cdiversity\u201d doesn\u2019t appear anywhere in its 135 pages.\n\nUber didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment Friday.\n\nSalesforce\nSalesforce CEO Marc Benioff once was on a crusade to inspire other corporate leaders to become social activists in a drive to fix a \u201ctrain wreck\u201d of inequality, but he has since toned down that message while pledging to work with President Donald Trump \u201cto drive American success and prosperity for all.\u201d\n\nAlthough Benioff personally has remained an outspoken supporter of LGBTQ+ rights, Salesforce is no longer touting its diversity program. After carving out a section of its annual report filed last year to declare, \u201cEquality, Diversity and Inclusion Equality is a core value at Salesforce,\u201d the San Francisco excluded any discussion of diversity programs in its latest annual report filed March 5.\n\n\u201cWhile we don\u2019t have representation goals, we remain committed to our value of equality,\u201d Salesforce said in a statement.\n\nPepsi\nPepsiCo confirmed that it\u2019s ending some of its diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, even as rival Coca-Cola voiced support for its own inclusion efforts.\n\nIn a memo sent to employees, PepsiCo CEO Ramon Laguarta said the company will no longer set goals for minority representation in its managerial roles or supplier base. The company will also align its sponsorships to events and groups that promote business growth, he said.\n\nLaguarta wrote that inclusion remains important to PepsiCo, whose brands include Gatorade, Lay\u2019s potato chips, Doritos, Mountain Dew as well as Pepsi. The Purchase, New York-based company\u2019s chief diversity officer will transition to a broader role focused on employee engagement, leadership development and ensuring an inclusive culture, he said.\n\nGoldman Sachs\nInvestment firm Goldman Sachs confirmed that it was dropping a requirement that forced IPO clients to include women and members of minority groups on their board of directors.\n\n\u201cAs a result of legal developments related to board diversity requirements, we ended our formal board diversity policy,\u201d said a Goldman Sachs spokesman in an email to The Associated Press. \u201cWe continue to believe that successful boards benefit from diverse backgrounds and perspectives, and we will encourage them to take this approach.\u201d\n\nGoldman Sachs said that it will still have a placement service that connects its clients with diverse candidates to serve on their boards. \nGoogle\nGoogle rescinded a goal it had set in 2020 to increase representation of underrepresented groups among the company\u2019s leadership team by 30% within five years. In a memo to employees, the company also said it was considering other changes in response to Trump\u2019s executive order aimed at prohibiting federal contractors from conducting DEI practices that constitute \u201cillegal discrimination.\u201d\n\nGoogle\u2019s parent company Alphabet also signaled things were changing in its annual 10-K report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The report dropped a boilerplate sentence it has used since 2020 declaring that the company is \u201ccommitted to making diversity, equity, and inclusion part of everything we do and to growing a workforce that is representative of the users we serve.\u201d\n\nTarget\nThe retailer said that changes to its \u201cBelonging at the Bullseye\u201d strategy would include ending a program it established to help Black employees build meaningful careers, improve the experience of Black shoppers and to promote Black-owned businesses following Floyd\u2019s death in Minneapolis, where Target has its headquarters.\n\nTarget, which operates nearly 2,000 stores nationwide and employs more than 400,000 people, said it also would conclude the diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, goals it previously set in three-year cycles.\n\nThe goals included hiring and promoting more women and members of racial minority groups, and recruiting more diverse suppliers, including businesses owned by people of color, women, LGBTQ+ people, veterans and people with disabilities.\n\nTarget also will no longer participate in surveys designed to gauge the effectiveness of its actions, including an annual index compiled by the Human Rights Campaign, a national LGBTQ+ rights organization. Target also said it would further evaluate corporate partnerships to ensure they\u2019re connected directly to business objectives, but declined to share details.\n\nMeta Platforms\nThe parent company of Facebook and Instagram said it was getting rid of its diversity, equity and inclusion program, which featured policies for hiring, training and picking vendors.\n\nLike other companies that announced similar changes before Meta, the social media giant said it had been reviewing the program since the Supreme Court\u2019s July 2023 ruling upending affirmative action in higher education.\n\nCiting an internal memo sent to employees, news website Axios reported the Menlo Park, California-based tech giant said it would no longer have a team focused on diversity and inclusion and will instead \u201cfocus on how to apply fair and consistent practices that mitigate bias for all, no matter your background.\u201d The change means the company will also end its \u201cdiverse slate approach\u201d to hiring, which involved considering a diverse pool of candidates for every open position.\n\nAmazon\nAmazon said it was halting some of its DEI programs, although it did not specify which ones. In a Dec. 16 memo to employees, Candi Castleberry, a senior human resources executive, said the company has been \u201cwinding down outdated programs and materials, and we\u2019re aiming to complete that by the end of 2024.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe also know there will always be individuals or teams who continue to do well-intentioned things that don\u2019t align with our company-wide approach, and we might not always see those right away. But we\u2019ll keep at it,\u201d she wrote.\n\nRather than \u201chave individual groups build programs,\u201d Castleberry said, Amazon is \u201cfocusing on programs with proven outcomes \u2013 and we also aim to foster a more truly inclusive culture.\u201d\n\nMcDonald\u2019s\nMcDonald\u2019s said on Jan. 6 that it would retire specific goals for achieving diversity at senior leadership levels. It also planned to end a program that encouraged its suppliers to develop diversity training and to increase the number of minority group members represented within their own leadership ranks.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s later said it was changing \u2014 but not eliminating \u2014 a scholarship program for Latino students after it was sued by a group that opposes affirmative action. The program will now be open to any student who can demonstrate an impact on the Latino community, the fast-food giant said. Applicants no longer need to have at least one Latino parent.\n\nIn an open letter to employees and franchisees, McDonald\u2019s senior leadership team said it remained committed to inclusion and believes that having a diverse workforce is a competitive advantage. The company said it would continue to publicly report its demographic information and spending on diverse-owned suppliers.\n\nWalmart\nThe world\u2019s largest retailer confirmed in November that it would not be renewing a five-year commitment to a racial equity center set up in 2020 after the police killing of George Floyd, and that it would stop participating in the HRC\u2019s Corporate Equality Index.\n\nWalmart also said it will better monitor its third-party marketplace to make sure items sold there do not include products aimed at LGBTQ+ minors, including chest binders intended for transgender youth.\n\nAdditionally, the company will no longer consider race and gender as a litmus test to improve diversity when it offers supplier contracts and it won\u2019t be gathering demographic data when determining financing eligibility for those grants.\n\nFord\nCEO Jim Farley sent a memo to the automaker\u2019s employees in August outlining changes to the company\u2019s DEI policies, including a decision to stop taking part in HRC\u2019s Corporate Equality Index.\n\nFord, he wrote, had been looking at its policies for a year. The company doesn\u2019t use hiring quotas or tie compensation to specific diversity goals but remains committed to \u201cfostering a safe and inclusive workplace,\u201d Farley said.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to put our effort and resources into taking care of our customers, our team, and our communities versus publicly commenting on the many polarizing issues of the day,\u201d the memo said.\n\nLowe\u2019s\nIn August, Lowe\u2019s executive leadership said the company began \u201creviewing\u201d its programs following the Supreme Court\u2019s affirmative action ruling and decided to combine its employee resource groups into one umbrella organization. Previously, the company had \u201cindividual groups representing diverse sections of our associate population.\u201d\n\nThe retailer also will no longer participate in the HRC index, and will stop sponsoring and participating in events, such as festivals and parades, that are outside of its business areas.\n\nHarley-Davidson\nIn a post on X in August, Harley-Davidson said the company would review all sponsorships and organizations it was affiliated with, and that all would have to be centrally approved. It said the company would focus exclusively on growing the sport of motorcycling and retaining its loyal riding community, in addition to supporting first responders, active military members and veterans.\n\nThe motorcycle maker said it would no longer participate in the ranking of workplace equality compiled by the HRC, and that its trainings would be related to the needs of the business and absent of socially motivated content.\n\nHarley-Davidson also said it does not have hiring quotas and would no longer have supplier diversity spending goals.\n\nBrown-Forman\nThe parent company of Jack Daniels also pulled out from participating in the HRC\u2019s Corporate Equality Index, among other changes. Its leaders sent an email to employees in August saying the company launched its diversity and inclusion strategy in 2019, but since then \u201cthe world has evolved, our business has changed, and the legal and external landscape has shifted dramatically.\u201d\n\nThe company said it would remove its quantitative workforce and supplier diversity ambitions, ensure incentives and employee goals were tied to business performance, and review training programs for consistency with a revised strategy.\n\n\u201cBrown-Forman continues to foster an inclusive work environment where everyone is welcomed, respected, and able to bring their best self to work,\u201d spokeswoman Elizabeth Conway said in an email.\n\nJohn Deere\nThe farm equipment maker said in July that it would no longer sponsor \u201csocial or cultural awareness\u201d events, and that it would audit all training materials \u201cto ensure the absence of socially-motivated messages\u201d in compliance with federal and local laws.\n\nMoline, Illinois-based John Deere added \u201cthe existence of diversity quotas and pronoun identification have never been and are not company policy.\u201d But it noted that it would still continue to \u201ctrack and advance\u201d the diversity of the company.\n\nTractor Supply\nThe retailer in June said it was ending an array of corporate diversity and climate efforts, a move that came after weeks of online conservative backlash against the rural retailer.\n\nTractor Supply said it would be eliminating all of its DEI roles while retiring current DEI goals. The company added that it would \u201cstop sponsoring non-business activities\u201d such as Pride festivals or voting campaigns \u2014 and no longer submit data for the HRC index.\n\nThe Brentwood, Tennessee-based company, which sells products ranging from farming equipment to pet supplies, also said that it would withdraw from its carbon emission goals to instead \u201cfocus on our land and water conservation efforts.\u201d\n\nThe National Black Farmers Association called on Tractor Supply\u2019s president and CEO to step down shortly after the company\u2019s announcement.\n\n",
