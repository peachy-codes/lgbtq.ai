  "content": "President Donald Trump\u2019s assault on transgender rights is a gross overreach of presidential power and yet another attempt to punish trans people just for existing. After President Donald Trump issued an executive order restricting access to gender-affirming medical care for transgender people under 19, many hospitals nationwide abruptly cut off treatment for trans youth. This sent thousands of families scrambling, with some even wondering if they needed to leave the country to protect their family\u2019s future.\n\nIf enforced, President Trump\u2019s order will deny transgender youth access to medically-necessary care, like puberty blockers and hormone therapy, even as these same treatments remain readily available to their cisgender peers. The order also intends to cut or reduce federal funding for health care providers who refuse to prioritize the Trump administration\u2019s political preferences over their patients\u2019 medical needs. At the American Civil Liberties Union, we know that politics and partisanship have no place in patient care and we all deserve the freedom to be ourselves. On February 4th, alongside Lambda Legal and the ACLU of Maryland, we sued the Trump administration to block its discriminatory efforts to limit needed health care. We filed our suit on behalf of transgender young adults and their families, as well as PFLAG and GLMA, two of the nation\u2019s largest organizations supporting LGBTQ+ people and healthcare professionals.\n\nSince his first term, Trump and his administration have carried out a years-long effort to roll back protections for LGBTQ people. Beginning in January, the Trump administration issued a series of executive orders that remove protections for trans people. His directives include targeting transgender students, banning trans Americans from military service, and giving federal agencies the green light to openly discriminate against their trans employees. These orders align with the extremist vision of Project 2025, a sweeping right-wing agenda that seeks to dismantle civil rights protections, consolidate presidential power, and dehumanize transgender people. President Trump \u201cis determined to use every level of government to drive transgender people out of public life,\u201d says Joshua Block, senior counsel for the ACLU\u2019s LGBT & HIV Project. For Cameron, Gabe, and Robert, three of the five trans young people challenging the Trump administration\u2019s anti-trans agenda, this fight goes beyond the courtroom. It\u2019s about their fundamental right to make deeply personal medical decisions without government interference.\n\nFor Cameron, words like \u201cboy\u201d or \u201cgirl\u201d were never meaningful. Being seen as nonbinary makes them feel \u201cstrong, happy, recognized, and loved.\u201d Before puberty, they worried about how others would treat them based on their clothes and pronouns. Now, as their physical-self matures, Cameron worries about how they see their own body. \u201cThe changes feel violating,\u201d they say. \u201cIt makes me depressed, stressed, and anxious.\u201d\n\nAfter seeing a therapist, Cameron\u2019s parents consulted a doctor who first spoke to them about puberty blockers, a temporary pause that gives people time to decide whether to undergo male or female puberty. Getting more time was a relief to Cameron who, after starting treatment at 12, remembers feeling \"less stressed and a little more hopeful.\" However, Cameron\u2019s appointment for a puberty-blocking implant was abruptly canceled after the Trump administration issued its executive order. Their anxieties came rushing back, resulting in stomach pain, restless sleep, and missed school. Their parents fought to find a new doctor. Though Cameron did finally receive their implant, they fear losing care again. \u201cI do not want to feel like a stranger in my body,\u201d they told the ACLU.\n\nFor Gabe, a 14-year-old transgender boy, he hopes gender-affirming medical care will help him look and sound more like himself. Often, when strangers see him in public, they address him using male pronouns. Until he speaks. His voice still does not reflect who he is and causes people to misgender him, which only adds to the anxiety and dysmorphia that began when he started puberty.\n\n\u201cEven when I wasn\u2019t sure why the changes felt wrong, I just knew they were,\u201d Gabe says, reflecting on his experience trying to navigate his changing body.\n\nTo treat his dysphoria, Gabe\u2019s parents consulted a doctor who explained how testosterone could help him feel more comfortable in his body. Gabe knew it was the right choice for him. \u201cI want to be in a grown-up male body when I\u2019m older,\u201d he says. \u201cI want the choice to tell people, not to be revealed by my voice.\u201d\n\nGabe hoped to begin testosterone treatments in March 2025, but the administration\u2019s actions put his plans at risk. Like many trans youth, Gabe now fears that he won\u2019t have the choice to present as he truly is.\n\nFamilies of trans youth also feel the impact of Trump\u2019s discriminatory order. Rachel, a member of PFLAG, has always prioritized her son Robert\u2019s health and well-being. From a very early age, she knew that Robert was meant to be a boy and that \u201che would thrive in school and the rest of his life if we let him live that way.\u201d\n\nAt nine, Robert was diagnosed with gender dysphoria. Rachel made sure he received the care he needed. Under medical guidance, he began puberty blockers to prevent changes that would conflict with his identity. By 14, after years of therapy and careful consideration, he started testosterone. \u201cAs his mother, I agreed with his doctors that Robert would benefit from going through puberty alongside his peers,\u201d Rachel says.\n\nRobert is 16 now and is \u201chealthy, social, and thriving.\u201d But on January 29th, Rachel received a call: Robert\u2019s appointment, a routine check-up for his hormone therapy, was canceled. \u201cI am devastated that the president has sought to prevent my child from accessing the health care that allows him to be his true self,\u201d Rachel says.\n\nWithout testosterone, Rachel fears that Robert will face severe distress. \u201cThis is a child who has told me since age two that he is a boy,\u201d she says. \u201cHe is now a young man. It would be alarming for him to suddenly develop a woman\u2019s body.\u201d\n\nCameron, Robert, Gabe, and so many families like theirs see President Trump\u2019s assault on their rights for what it is: an overreach of presidential power to deny them the health care that serves as the foundation of their lives and their future. At the ACLU, we refuse to let politics dictate who can and cannot receive essential healthcare, but our fight is about more than policy. Like all of us, trans youth deserve to grow up with the care and support they need. We will not stop fighting until their rights are protected.\n\n ",
