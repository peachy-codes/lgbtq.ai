The other would have reversed a 2013 law allowing students to participate in sex-segregated school programs, including on sports teams, and use bathrooms and other facilities that align with their gender identity. It would have applied to K-12 and college students.\n\nThe hearing came a day after Transgender Day of Visibility, and weeks after Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom angered his political allies when he suggested on his podcast it\u2019s unfair for transgender athletes to participate in girls sports.\n\nDemocratic Assemblymember Chris Ward, the committee chair who leads the legislative LGBTQ+ caucus, said the bills were part of a broader attack on the rights of transgender youth. He said they could also be invasive to cisgender girls who might be asked to prove their sex.\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anybody should be gender policing women and girls,\u201d Ward said.\n\nBut Republican Assemblymember Bill Essayli, who authored the bill to reverse the 2013 law, said the proposal was about fairness.\n\n\u201cBiology matters,\u201d he said. \u201cSports are one of the places where that reality is most obvious.\u201d\n\nTaylor Starling, a student-athlete in Riverside who says a trans runner took her spot on her high school\u2019s varsity cross country team, said a ban would help ensure female athletes are treated fairly. \u201cWhy are girls being told that we must sit down and be quiet while boys unfairly get ahead of us in life?\u201d she said.\n\nBut LGBTQ+ advocates and parents of transgender children urged lawmakers to support trans kids \u2014 in sports and beyond.\n\nCati Johnson, a parent of a transgender girl in middle school, said it was important to defend the rights and protections of trans kids, such as the ability to use a restroom that aligns with their gender identity.\n\n\u201cThe facilities ban really sends the message that she is not welcome as her authentic self,\u201d Johnson said of her daughter. \u201cAnd that\u2019s just not OK.\u201d\n\nThere are more than 49,000 trans youth aged 13 to 17 in California, according to an estimate from the Williams Institute, a group at the UCLA School of Law that researches LGBTQ+ issues.\n\n\u201cWhile we know of a few high-profile stories of trans girls who play on teams, we are not seeing evidence that their participation is unfair or harmful,\u201d said Elana Redfield, the group\u2019s federal policy director. \u201cMostly, these laws appear to be motivated by anti-transgender bias.\u201d At least 24 states have laws on the books barring transgender women and girls from participating in certain women\u2019s or girls sports competitions. Judges have temporarily blocked bans in Arizona, Idaho and Utah. In New Hampshire and West Virginia, students who sued those states over bans were allowed to compete. At the federal level, President Donald Trump signed an executive order last month aimed at barring transgender athletes from participating in girls and women\u2019s sports.\n\nSome states have also imposed bans on gender-affirming care and required schools to share students\u2019 gender identity with parents without the students\u2019 consent.\n\nEssayli and other proponents of the proposals referred multiple times to Newsom\u2019s comments. The governor later told The Los Angeles Times he had deliberated on the issue for years, and he stuck by his comments.\n\n\u201cI know that hurt a lot of people. But respectfully, I just disagree with those on the other side of this,\u201d he said.\n\nNewsom has not directly called for a reversal of existing state law and won\u2019t have to weigh in after the bills died.\n\nEducation Secretary Linda McMahon sent Newsom a letter last week, saying his remarks on his podcast caught her attention and requesting he clarify his stance.\n\n\u201cTake a stand on your convictions,\u201d she wrote. \u201cBe clear about the harms of gender confusion. Protect female spaces. Do not encourage children to seek permanent medical interventions to their sex.
