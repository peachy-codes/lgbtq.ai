In the six days since the executive order on Jan. 28 titled \u201cProtecting Children from Chemical and Surgical Mutilation\u201d (discussed here), three new significant developments have taken place, two highly positive ones that are coming from the Trump administration and one very negative one coming from Democrats. (RELATED: Trump Protects Children From Woke Abuse: New Executive Order Bans Chemical and Surgical Mutilation)\nThe Trump Administration Purifies the Executive Branch of \u201cGender Ideology\u201d\n\nOn Jan. 29, the Office of Personnel Management sent out a memo to all the heads of departments and agencies, telling them to end the promotion of \u201cgender ideology\u201d (the idea that males can become female and females male) in accordance with Trump\u2019s EO \u201cDefending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government,\u201d and to do so by Friday, Jan. 31 at 5 p.m. (READ MORE: Trump\u2019s Executive Order Ends \u2018Trans\u2019 Tyranny and Protects Females)\n\nThe scope and speed of the transgender housecleaning was impressive:\n\n    Take down all federal websites or information within them that promote gender ideology.\n    Terminate \u201call agency programs, contracts, and grants\u201d and withdraw any regulations or directives that \u201cpromote \u2026 gender ideology.\u201d\n    Require all federal employees to remove pronouns from their email signatures.\n    \u201cEnsure that intimate spaces \u2026 are designated by biological sex and not gender identity.\u201d No more biological males in female restrooms.\n    Cancel any training that promotes gender ideology \u2014 no more struggle sessions.\n    Remove from all documents \u201cgender\u201d or \u201cgender identity\u201d and replace with \u201csex,\u201d allowing only the binary option of \u201cmale\u201d or \u201cfemale.\u201d\n    Put on \u201cpaid administrative leave\u201d \u201call employees whose position description involves \u2026 promoting gender ideology.\u201d\n\nCompliance with the memo was reached by the deadline. Naturally, the left-wing media went into spasms over this memo (for examples go here, here, here, and here). Yet it was a boldly positive move for the country, which is growing increasingly tired of having to violate reason, conscience, and faith, not to mention endanger women and children, in order to appease the transgender idol.\n\nMy only regret is that the promotion of \u201csexual orientation\u201d did not incur the same fate as \u201cgender identity.\u201d\nThe First Fruits of Trump\u2019s Executive Order Combatting Trans Child Abuse\n\nThe second new (and positive) development was celebrated by the White House in a statement released on Feb. 3., Trump\u2019s executive order \u201cProtecting Children from Chemical and Surgical Mutilation\u201d was \u201calready having its intended effect \u2014 preventing children from being maimed and sterilized by adults perpetuating a radical, false claim that they can somehow change a child\u2019s sex.\u201d\n\nHospitals were the most impacted by the executive order: \u201cHospitals around the country are taking action to downsize or eliminate their so-called \u2018gender-affirming care\u2019 programs.\u201d The following are cases in point:\n\n    Denver Health in Colorado, while obviously not wanting to comply with Trump\u2019s EO, recognized in a Jan. 30 statement that they had little choice in the matter, since the EO\n\n    includes criminal and financial consequences for those who do not comply, including placing participation in federal programs including Medicare, Medicaid and other programs administered by HHS at risk. These programs represent a significant portion of Denver Health\u2019s funding\u2026. The loss of this funding would critically impair our ability to provide care for the Denver community.\n\nHow much is \u201ca significant portion\u201d? About $350 million per year in lost funding for Denver Health. Money talks even to transgender advocates who normally lack \u201cthe ears to hear.\u201d\n\n    Other hospitals that have \u201cpaused\u201d or \u201csuspended\u201d the use of puberty blockers, cross-gender hormones, and transgender surgery on minors include: Children\u2019s National Hospital in Washington, D.C.; Children\u2019s Hospital of Richmond, VA and Virginia Commonwealth University Health; and \u201cChildren\u2019s Hospital of The King\u2019s Daughters\u201d in Norfolk, VA.\n    New York City\u2019s NYU Langone Health, \u201cone of several major medical centers in the city with transgender health programs for youths,\u201d reportedly began canceling puberty-blocking arm implants for 12-year-olds. New York has a huge \u201ctransgender child\u201d problem from its coercive trans-indoctrination of children in the schools and the media. According to the New York Times, a whopping 3 percent of children aged 13 to 17 in the state of New York identify as transgender.\n\nDemocrats Strike Back in an Attempt to Reinstate Chemical Castration of Children\n\nThe third new development is a negative one: An attempt by Democrats to reinstate the destruction of children\u2019s bodies. This has taken two forms.\n\nFirst, New York\u2019s notorious attorney general, Letitia James, sent a letter on Feb. 3 threatening hospitals with prosecution for violating the state\u2019s anti-discrimination laws regarding \u201cgender identity\u201d as a protected class if they don\u2019t continue dispensing puberty blockers and cross-gender hormones to children. James is determined to continue the practice of state-sponsored child abuse, lying to impressionable children about whether they can switch sexes, transitioning them to lifelong sterility and gender freakishness without any thought for how neurological, psychological, and sociological factors may be fueling their gender dysphoria.\n\nSecond, two Democrat Federal District Court judges have issued temporary restraining orders designed to thwart Trump\u2019s attempt to manage federal funding consistent with his EOs. One restraining order was issued on Jan. 31 by the judge of the U.S. District Court of Rhode Island, John McConnell, an Obama appointee, in response to a lawsuit brought by Democratic state attorneys general.\n\nThe complaint had to do with the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s general freeze on federal assistance to the states until a review of federal programs and policies could be made. The judge ruled that, until further order of the court, the federal government will not be able to \u201cstop, delay, or otherwise withhold federal financial assistance programs\u201d to the states.\n\nOn Feb. 3, the U.S. District Court Judge for the District of Columbia, Loren AliKhan, a Biden appointee, in response to a lawsuit brought by nonprofits, issued a similar (but even more hostile) temporary restraining order. She indicated that the Trump administration would likely be ruled against for not \u201ctaking a measured approach to identify purportedly wasteful spending.\u201d According to the acting director for the Office of Management and Budget, these rulings may affect Trump\u2019s EOs, including \u201cfinancial assistance for \u2026 DEI, woke gender ideology, and the Green New Deal,\u201d pending further clarity by these judges.\n\nIt remains to be seen how this will all pan out. Not every issue is straightforward and obvious. This one is: The protection of children from the harmful clutches of transgender activism is a clear case of good. The pursuit of children by leftist sexual extremists, scarring children for life and destroying biological realities, is an obvious instance of evil.",
