  "content": "Rather than highlight the dangerous and irreversible procedures associated with transgenderism, such as chemical castration and genital mutilation, many major corporations have opted to champion trans ideology \u2014 even for unsuspecting children. In order to help Americans hold these companies financially accountable, The Federalist has compiled a list of major businesses promoting and glorifying gender dysphoria.\n73. Jaguar\n\nThe British car manufacturer released an ad featuring androgynous models donning brightly colored clothing, one of whom appears to be a man in a dress. As noted by Fox Business, \u201cThe ad did not feature a car throughout its entire 30-second run.\u201d\n\nThe commercial is part of Jaguar\u2019s new \u201cCopy Nothing\u201d campaign, which according to a Nov. 18 press release, is a \u201cnew era\u201d for the company \u201cthat will include the physical manifestation of its Exuberant Modernism creative philosophy, in a Design Vision Concept.\u201d\n\nThe apparent rebrand is seemingly part of the car company\u2019s embrace of DEI ideology. Last month, Jaguar\u2019s Santino Pietrosanti reportedly spoke at an LGBT awards ceremony to declare the brand\u2019s commitment to \u201cfostering a diverse, inclusive and unified culture that is representative not only of the people who use our products, but in a society in which we all live, a culture in which our employees can bring their authentic selves to work.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd we are on a transformative journey of our own, driven by a belief in diversity, inclusion, creativity, policy and most importantly, action. We\u2019ve established over 15 DEI groups,\u201d Pietrosanti said.\n72. Harley-Davidson\n\nRobby Starbuck\u2019s investigation into the motorcycle brand reportedly revealed that Harley-Davidson has \u201cgone totally woke\u201d by, as the New York Post summarized, \u201chosting an LGBTQ+ boot camp at its offices, sponsoring Pride events and subjecting white employees to DEI indoctrination.\u201d\n\nThe company is also a platinum founding member of the Wisconsin LGBT Chamber of Commerce.\n71. John Deere\n\nUnbeknownst to its conservative-leaning customer base, the outdoors company has been a major proponent of radical gender ideology. According to the Washington Examiner, John Deere \u201cwas recently honored at the Out & Equal Workplace Summit for its focus on diversity and inclusion after it reportedly funded an LGBT pride event for children and asked employees to list their pronouns on all communications.\u201d\n\nIn response to consumer backlash, the company issued a statement on July 16, 2024, pledging to no longer participate in or support \u201cexternal social or cultural awareness parades, festivals, or events.\u201d As noted by Robby Starbuck, the conservative filmmaker who unearthed John Deere\u2019s LGBT obsession, the business did not pledge to revoke DEI policies.\n70. The LEGO Group\n\nThe popular toy brand released a celebratory \u201cpride parade\u201d video on its Instagram account. The video features rainbow-colored LGBT LEGO figures participating in a \u201cpride\u201d parade.\n\n\u201cThese dazzling minifigures are ready for Pride with their very own spectacular Pride celebration!\u201d the post caption reads, alongside the hashtags #LEGO #Pride #Celebration #LGBTQIA.\n\nThe company previously released an LGBT-themed LEGO set in 2021 to \u201ccelebrate the LGBT community and more inclusivity,\u201d according to the Washington Examiner.\n69. Tractor Supply Company\n\nThe retail giant devotes an entire page on its website to describing its commitment to so-called \u201cdiversity, equity, and inclusion\u201d initiatives. The company\u2019s DEI Council provides team members with access to Tractor Supply \u201cresource groups,\u201d one of which is called \u201cLGBTQ+ You Belong OUT Here.\u201d\n\nTractor Supply previously announced its commitment to left-wing ESG standards in 2021, which included \u201ccarbon reduction goals\u201d and plans to \u201cIncrease People of Color at the manager level and above by 50%.\u201d\n68. Boy Scouts of America\n\nIn the name of boosting \u201cinclusivity,\u201d the longstanding male-dominated organization changed its name to \u201cScouting America\u201d to \u201cwelcome every youth and family in America.\u201d\n\nThis decision \u201csends a really strong message to everyone in America that they can come to this program, they can bring their authentic self, they can be who they are, and they will be welcomed here,\u201d CEO Roger Crone said.\n\nOnce a males-only organization, Boy Scouts of America began accepting females into its programs five years ago, according to The Daily Caller. In 2013, the organization began accepting homosexual members of troops that sometimes sleep together outdoors, and in 2015 began allowing openly homosexual troop leaders to run the boys\u2019 organization.\n67. Aveeno\n\nIn an ad highlighting its kid\u2019s shampoo, the skincare brand featured a young boy wearing a rainbow dress.\n66. Doritos\n\nOwned by PepsiCo., Doritos brought on transgender Samantha Hudson \u2014 who previously went by the name Iv\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez Ranedo \u2014 as a brand ambassador. According to The Daily Caller, Hudson has posted several graphic and disturbing comments on social media involving minors. In 2015, for example, he tweeted, \u201cquiero hacer cosas gamberras como meterme a una nina de 12 anos por el ojete,\u201d which roughly translates to \u201cI want to do thuggish things like stick a 12 year old girl up her -sshole.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s also advocated for \u201cthe abolition of [and to] destroy and annihilate the traditional monogamous nuclear family.\u201d\n65. Virgin Atlantic\n\nVirgin Atlantic sponsored the 2023 Virgin Atlantic Attitude Awards which named Dylan Mulvaney, a man who masquerades as a woman, as its first \u201cwoman of the year.\u201d\n\nThe photo shoot that accompanied the award features Mulaney in full makeup and various dresses. The images are emblazoned with the British airline\u2019s logo.\n\nElevating Mulvaney as a \u201cwoman\u201d wasn\u2019t Virgin Atlantic\u2019s first appeal to the LGBT agenda. In September 2022, the airline was heralded by corporate media for dropping its sex-specific uniform requirements and accommodating calls for pronoun pins.\n64. Braun\n\nThe shaving company featured a trans-identifying woman in an ad for its Braun Series X Hybrid Trimmers. The ad image, which the company told Newsweek is two years old, shows the shirtless female with mastectomy scars shaving her beard with the Braun razor.\n63. Indeed\n\nPopular job search engine Indeed made headlines in summer 2023 after it announced that it would give any of its self-identified gender dysphoric employees or their immediate family members $10,000 to move to states that still allow radical gender experimentation.\n\nThe Texas-based company\u2019s decision comes amid a conservative-led crackdown in dozens of states on the widely unpopular practice of surgically mutilating children.\n62. Vampyre Cosmetics\n\nThe gothic cosmetics company Vampyre Cosmetics canceled a partnership with rockstar Alice Cooper over the singer\u2019s comments on transgenderism.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m understanding that there are cases of transgender, but I\u2019m afraid that it\u2019s also a fad, and I\u2019m afraid there\u2019s a lot of people claiming to be this just because they want to be that,\u201d Cooper said in a recent interview. \u201cI find it wrong when you\u2019ve got a six-year-old kid who has no idea. He just wants to play, and you\u2019re confusing him telling him, \u2018Yeah, you\u2019re a boy, but you could be a girl if you want to be.'\u201d\n\nThe remarks drew a condemnation from the cosmetic supplier.\n\n\u201cIn light of recent statements by Alice Cooper we will no\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b longer be doing a makeup collaboration,\u201d the company wrote in a Friday statement. \u201cWe stand with all members of the LGBTQIA+ community and believe everyone should have access to healthcare. All pre-order sales will be refunded.\u201d\n61. Listerine\n\nMouthwash brand Listerine created and sold a product covered with rainbow and pro-transgenderism graphics, and is part of a \u201cCare With Pride\u201d initiative run by its parent company Kenvue, which also owns brands like Neutrogena, Tylenol, and Band-Aid. \u201cSince its inception more than a decade ago, Care With Pride has donated more than $1.5 million to LGBTQIA+ nonprofit groups,\u201d according to Kenvue\u2019s website \u2014 including Family Equality, a group that promotes transgender surgeries.\n60. Mars Inc.\n\nSkittles \u2014 which is owned by Mars Inc. \u2014 recently launched a series of new LBGT-themed candy wrappers. Listed under \u201cSKITTLES Pride\u201d on the company\u2019s website are several pro-LGBT box designs, one of which includes the phrase, \u201cBlack Trans Lives Matter.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve given up our rainbow so that the LGBTQ+ community can share theirs,\u201d a website caption reads. \u201cThis Pride Month, we\u2019re amplifying stories within the LGBTQ+ community for all to discover. We begin by showcasing the designs of five talented artists on our SKITTLES Pride Packs, each with their own story to tell.\u201d\n59. Harry\u2019s\n\nThe razor blade company partnered with a self-identifying \u201ctrans man\u201d to launch a new razor set for \u201cpride month\u201d 2022, with 100 percent of the set\u2019s profits reportedly going to the Trevor Project, a radical LGBT organization that supports chemically castrating minors. For \u201cpride month\u201d 2023, Harry\u2019s gave $5 to the Trevor Project for every \u201cPride Shave set sold.\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s is a regular financial contributor to the group, according to the razor company\u2019s website.\n58. T-Mobile\n\nThe cell service provider released an ad on June 1, 2023, featuring Nik Kacy, a self-described \u201ctransmasculine individual who identifies as nonbinary\u201d and uses \u201cthey/them\u201d pronouns. In the video, Kacy highlights her focus on building \u201ca network of other queer entrepreneurs where we brainstorm, [and] collaborate.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe really support one another a lot,\u201d Kacy said.\n57.

Pottery Barn\n\nUpscale furniture brand Pottery Barn jumped on the radical gender ideology bandwagon in June 2023 when it hosted a virtual reading of the transgender propaganda book I Am Jazz.\n\nThe video features \u201cJazz,\u201d a boy whose parents profited off of marketing him as one of the youngest children to consistently cross-dress and use pronouns that don\u2019t correspond with reality.

Adidas\n\nThe sportswear company selected a man to model one of its swimsuits for the company\u2019s 2023 women\u2019s swimwear line.

Sports Illustrated\n\nSports Illustrated has received flak over the years for plastering pictures of mostly nude women all over its swimsuit issues. The magazine\u2019s controversial reputation only intensified when it traded featuring female models for men with fake booties and breasts.\n\nIn 2021, SI chose Leyna Bloom, a man, to cover one of its summer issues. The lead photo shows Bloom in a bathing suit that shows off his artificially modified chest.\n\nSI furthered its commitment to advancing radical gender ideology in 2023 when it chose its second transgender cover model, singer Kim Petras, for its swimsuit issue.\n47.

For toddlers, the company reportedly also offered tie-dye T-shirts proclaiming \u201ctrans rights are human rights.\u201d\n\nTarget was an early corporate activist for the transgender movement, drawing backlash in 2016 for welcoming sexually confused men to use women\u2019s restrooms.\n46. Urban Outfitters\n\nFor years now, retailer corporation Urban Outfitters gravitated towards selling gender-bending clothing.\n\nIn 2017, UO\u2019s shift towards transgenderism became even more apparent when it launched an ad campaign featuring at least one transgender model. By June of last year, the clothing company expanded its embrace of radical gender ideology to promoting alphabet activist organizations such as the Transgender Law Center.\n\nMore recently, Anthropologie, whose parent company is Urban Outfitters, shut down the comment section on one of its Instagram posts after it received harsh backlash for showing off women\u2019s dresses and other clothing using a male model.\n45.

U.S. Navy\n\nWhile the U.S. Navy isn\u2019t technically a company, its move to push pro-transgender propaganda falls far outside of the service branch\u2019s proper role and mimics the gimmicky decisions of corporate boardrooms. In addition to pushing pronouns, the U.S. Navy hired active-duty drag queen Yeoman 2nd Class Joshua Kelley to be one of five \u201cNavy Digital Ambassadors.\u201d These ambassadors are instructed to \u201cattract the most talented and diverse workforce\u201d amidst what has become one of U.S. Naval leadership\u2019s biggest hiring droughts.\n43. Lionsgate\n\nThe film studio\u2019s upcoming adaptation of \u201cThe Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes,\u201d will feature Hunter Schafer, a transgender-identifying man, portraying a female character from the series.

The women\u2019s magazine also posted a \u201cget ready with me\u201d video with Mulvaney to its TikTok account.\n\n\u201cIf there is one thing @dylanmulvaney is going to do, she is going to have a good time no matter what is happening. Not only that, she makes sure her beautiful energy touches others. Follow along as actor, singer and Tiktok tour de force gets glam for her A List photoshoot,\u201d the video description states.\n41. Sephora\n\nFor years now, beauty brand chain Sephora has centered its business model around the promotion of transgenderism.\n\nIn 2018, the company launched makeup classes and tutorials that help men use cosmetics to cover up their inherently male features and masquerade as women.\n\nSince then, Sephora has only doubled down on its embrace of radical gender ideology. The company\u2019s advertisements featuring cross-dressing children and fake pronouns were even rewarded by a Webby nomination.\n40. Pantene\n\nIn addition to partnering with organizations that promote harmful, irreversible mutilation, specifically on children, hair care brand Pantene is responsible for several marketing campaigns endorsing gender-bending.\n\nIn 2021, the company launched an advertisement featuring a young boy whose lesbian guardians help him pretend to be a girl.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Pantene/status/1371574552715747335?s=20\n\nPantene\u2019s alphabet sexuality propaganda can be found all across the globe in countries including the Philippines and the United Kingdom.\n39. Maybelline New York\n\nMakeup brand Maybelline is no stranger to using men to sell products primarily created for women.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Maybelline/status/1141395070052118530?s=20\n\nIn 2019, the company partnered with Beauty Studio to give makeovers to men who think costumes and accessories will make them women.\n\nThe worldwide company also advertised its products in several commercials aimed at highlighting the alleged \u201ctoxic harassment facing women, non-binary people and other LGBTQIA+ communities.\u201d\n38. Honey Birdette\n\nHoney Birdette posted a photo of Jake DuPree \u2014 who calls himself \u201cnon-binary\u201d and uses \u201cthey/them\u201d pronouns \u2014 on its Instagram modeling the company\u2019s lingerie products. When pressed by Outkick on what led to the decision to have a man model lingerie, Honey Birdette claimed it \u201cfosters an inclusive and diverse environment\u201d and pledged to use its \u201cvoice to empower and support the LGBTQ+ community, women, and anyone who wants to feel fabulous in our lingerie.\u201d\n\nThe lingerie brand also asserted it will delete any \u201cnegative comments\u201d on its Instagram post featuring DuPree.\n37. Olay\n\nBeauty cream brand Olay partnered with Dylan Mulvaney, a man famous for his mockery of women, in March 2023 to promote its new sunscreen line.

Olay also posted a compilation video of its paid partners, all of whom are female except Mulvaney, to its TikTok page.\n36. Amazon\n\nAmazon has a history of catering to LGBT activists by promoting their content and memory holing any products or materials that discuss the severe and irreversible damage ill-named \u201ctransitions\u201d have on people who undergo them.\n\nMost recently, just one day after a transgender shooter killed three students and three staff at a Nashville Christian school, Amazon Vice President of Global Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Candi Castleberry sent a message to \u201cLGBTQIA+ employees and allies\u201d reaffirming that the company \u201cremains in solidarity with our LGBTQIA+ employees, customers, and communities\u201d during \u201cthis period of apprehension and uncertainty.\u201d\n\nDays before that, Amazon released an advertisement promoting \u201cinclusivity\u201d by featuring a girl who comes to terms with light facial hair after she dresses up like male singer Freddie Mercury.\n35.

Native\n\nDeodorant company Native embraced the left\u2019s alphabet sexual ideology when it partnered with glamorized male Dylan Mulvaney and the notorious transgender activist organization The Trevor Project and Walmart to promote its products. Native also used Mulvaney to announce a new product scent, with the caption \u201c@Dylan Mulvaney\u2019s wish is our command.\u201d\n28. Neutrogena\n\nMulvaney, dressed up in a crop top and skirt, also listed a video of himself promoting Neutrogena\u2019s June 2022 \u201cMake A Splash\u201d campaign as a \u201cpaid partnership.\u201d\n27. Tampax\n\nFor years now, tampon brand Tampax has ignored biological reality to push the transgender agenda.
