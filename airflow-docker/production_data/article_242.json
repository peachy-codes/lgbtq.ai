  "content": "Thanks to Donald Trump\u2019s new executive order, entitled \u201cDefending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government,\u201d the federal government is no longer coming after you for not recognizing \u201ctranswomen\u201d as women or \u201ctransmen\u201d as men in schools, workplaces, and public accommodations.\n\nThis is a major about-face from the Biden\u2013Harris administration\u2019s insidious promotion of all things \u201ctrans,\u201d endangering children (indoctrination, chemical castration, \u201ctrans\u201d mutilation surgery), females (privacy and safety), and faithful Christians everywhere (mandatory speech requirements in employment and education).\nTrump\u2019s Fidelity to His Election Promise\n\nTrump was true to his commitment over a year ago to work against the \u201cleft-wing gender insanity being pushed on our children [which] is an act of child abuse\u201d and \u201cto stop the chemical, physical, and emotional mutilation of our youth.\u201d The executive order fleshed out what was arguably the greatest line in his Inaugural Address: \u201cAs of today, it will henceforth be the official policy of the United States government that there are only two genders, male and female.\u201d\n\nThis one action alone justifies the outcome of the election (there are, of course, other reasons) because the eradication of any non-circular definition of \u201cwoman\u201d and \u201cman\u201d (or \u201cmale\u201d and \u201cfemale\u201d) does inestimable damage to this most essential element of human civilization.\nDescription of the Problem for Women\n\nThe opening \u201cPurpose\u201d section artfully summarizes the problem by presenting it as a problem for women: \u201cIdeologues who deny the biological reality of sex have \u2026 used \u2026 coercive means to permit men to \u2026 gain access to intimate single-sex spaces \u2026 designed for women\u2026. This is wrong.\u201d Such efforts \u201cattack women by depriving them of their dignity, safety, and well-being.\u201d Moreover, \u201cbasing Federal policy on truth is critical to scientific inquiry, public safety, morale, and trust in government itself.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s executive order rightfully pinpoints the locus of confusion as \u201creplacing the immutable biological reality of sex with an internal, fluid, and subjective sense of self unmoored from biological facts.\u201d The sad result is that laws originally designed to protect women are perverted to \u201cundermine them, replacing longstanding, cherished legal rights and values with an identity-based, inchoate social concept.\u201d\n\nIn order to preserve the original intent of legislation to protect women, the government has no choice but to revert back to a biologically based definition of what a woman is and what a man is. \u201cAccordingly, my Administration will defend women\u2019s rights and protect freedom of conscience by using clear and accurate language and policies that recognize women are biologically female, and men are biologically male.\u201d\nDefinition of \u201cSex\u201d and of \u201cMale\u201d and \u201cFemale\u201d\n\nThe second section of \u201cPolicy and Definitions\u201d pulls the rug out from under the house of cards that stand atop \u201cgender ideology\u201d and \u201cgender identity\u201d by re-establishing a secure basis for \u201csex.\u201d\n\nUnder Trump\u2019s watch, the federal government will no longer define a \u201cmale\u201d and \u201cfemale\u201d by subjective identity but solely by objective biological identity, i.e., by gametes or reproductive function. \u201c\u2018Female\u2019 means a person belonging, at conception, to the sex that produces the large reproductive cell [i.e., egg cell or ovum]. \u2018Male\u2019 means a person belonging, at conception, to the sex that produces the small reproductive cell [i.e., the sperm cell].\u201d\nImpact on Federal Law and Policy\n\nSections 3 through 8 largely spell out the practical effects on federal policy and regulations of reverting back to biologically objective definitions of \u201csex\u201d that are based on male-female reproductive complementarity.\n\nPerhaps the biggest hit was rescinding part of Biden\u2019s executive order, which had redefined the prohibition of \u201csex discrimination\u201d in Title IX of the Educational Amendments Act to include not only \u201csexual orientation discrimination\u201d but also \u201cgender identity discrimination.\u201d In schools that receive federal funding, males will no longer be allowed into female restrooms, locker rooms, female living facilities, and sports (the latter two were still being worked on at the time of the Biden administration\u2019s revisions to Title IX in April 2024).\n\nBiden\u2019s Title IX executive order had recently faced challenges. With lawsuits from 26 Republican attorneys general, the Biden administration\u2019s revision of Title IX was on hold in their states. Earlier this month, a federal judge ruled that Biden\u2019s revision was unconstitutional. Last week, the House of Representatives passed a bill prohibiting men from competing in women\u2019s school sports. It now goes to the Senate.\n\nAlso according to Trump\u2019s new executive order, as regards facilities that receive federal funding, \u201cmales are not [to be] detained in women\u2019s prisons or housed in women\u2019s detention centers\u201d or allowed into female-only \u201crape shelters.\u201d And, \u201cno federal funds are [to be] expended for any medical procedure, treatment, or drug for the purpose of conforming an inmate\u2019s appearance to that of the opposite sex.\u201d\n\n\u201cIntimate spaces designated for women, girls, or females (or for men, boys, or males) are [to be ] designated by sex and not identity.\u201d This would include, of course, restrooms, locker rooms, and showers.\n\n\u201cAgencies shall remove all \u2026 regulations \u2026 that promote or otherwise inculcate gender ideology\u2026. Agencies shall take all necessary steps \u2026 to end the Federal funding of gender ideology,\u201d including in federal grants. \u201cGovernment-issued identification documents, including passports, visas, and Global Entry cards, [shall] accurately reflect the holder\u2019s sex,\u201d as also all \u201capplicable personnel records.\u201d\n\nAll federal guidance publications from previous administrations inconsistent with this new executive order are to be immediately rescinded, including (here I offer a selection of a much fuller list than in the executive order): \u201cThe White House Toolkit on Transgender Equality\u201d; \u201cCreating Inclusive and Nondiscriminatory School Environments for LGBTQI+ Students\u201d; \u201cSupporting LGBTQI+ Youth and Families in School\u201d; \u201cSupporting Intersex Students\u201d; \u201cSupporting Transgender Youth in School\u201d; \u201cConfronting Anti-LGBTQI+ Harassment in Schools\u201d; \u201cEnforcement of Title IX \u2026 With Respect to Discrimination Based on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in Light of Bostock v. Clayton County\u201d; \u201cEnforcement Guidance on Harassment [of LGBTQI+ Persons] in the Workplace\u201d (April 29, 2024).\n\nIn addition, the attorney general is charged with issuing \u201cguidance to ensure the freedom to express the binary nature of sex and the right to single-sex spaces in workplaces and federally funded entities covered by the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\u201d Presumably, this would include protection for teachers in schools who decline to use \u201ctrans\u201d pronouns for students, teachers, and staff.\n\nUndoubtedly, this executive order will be challenged in the courts, especially in relation to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Bostock v. Clayton County (2020), which addressed Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. This underscores the importance of strong court appointments. The executive order would not affect areas over which the federal government does not have authority. But it is an excellent start to the Trump administration.",
