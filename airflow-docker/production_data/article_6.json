Yost, was originally filed on March 26 by the American Civil Liberties Union, the ACLU of Ohio, and the global law firm Goodwin on behalf of two families whose transgender adolescents would be negatively impacted by HB 68. On August 6, following a five-day trial in July, the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 challenge, and allowed the ban to take effect. Today, transgender youth in Ohio will once again be able to access lifesaving healthcare.\n\nThe following is reaction to the ruling:\n\nFreda Levenson, Legal Director at the ACLU of Ohio:\n\n\u201cToday, we celebrate this win not only for our brave plaintiffs, but for all LGBTQ+ Ohioans and their families. This win restores the right of trans youth in Ohio to choose vitally important health care, with the support of their families and physicians. We are gratified by the Court\u2019s decision, which soundly rejects this interference of politicians with Ohioans\u2019 bodily autonomy. Although this litigation will likely not end here, we remain fervently committed to preventing this egregious bill from ever again taking effect. The path towards protecting the rights and civil liberties of trans Ohioans goes on, and we will continue to hold the torch.\u201d\n\nHarper Seldin, Senior Staff Attorney, American Civil Liberties Union:\n\u201cThis is a critical victory for transgender youth and their families across Ohio. The state\u2019s ban is discriminatory, baseless, and a danger to the well-being of the same Ohioan youth lawmakers claim to want to protect. It\u2019s also part of a sweeping effort to drive trans people out of public life altogether by controlling our health care, our families, and our lives. We\u2019re thankful the court upheld their rights under the state constitution.\u201d\n\nMiranda Hooker, Complex Litigation & Dispute Resolution Partner, Goodwin:\n\n\"We applaud the families who courageously shared their personal experiences to oppose House Bill 68. This victory underscores the critical need to safeguard bodily autonomy and access to essential healthcare. The decision marks an important milestone in advancing equality and personal freedom for all Ohioans and we will continue to fight against the unconstitutional Bill moving forward.\"\n",
