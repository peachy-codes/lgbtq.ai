  "content": "A federal court has granted a preliminary injunction blocking implementation of President Trump\u2019s executive order targeting transgender military service members. The 79-page opinion details the lengthy records of service and commendation of the trans plaintiffs, and notes the order\u2019s distinct lack of evidence to support a ban.\n\nThe preliminary injunction was issued in the legal challenge Talbott v. Trump, brought by LGBTQ legal groups GLAD Law and the National Center for Lesbian Rights. They are representing six active service members, two people actively seeking enlistment, and an additional 12 plaintiffs who joined the case since the filing on January 28th.\n\nThe court order detailed the transgender military members\u2019 skills, service, and honors earned:\n\n\u201cTogether they have provided over 130 years of military service. They have served in roles ranging from Senior Military Science Instructor to Artillery Platoon Commander to Intelligence Analyst to Satellite Operator to Operations Research Analyst to Naval Flight Officer to Weapons Officer.\u201d\n\u201cThey have deployed around the globe, from Afghanistan to Poland to Korea to Iraq to Kuwait to the USS Ronald Reagan and USS George W.

But, as they say, there is more, for the Military Ban does not stand alone.\u201d\nExecutive orders disparaging transgender identity, attempting to block access to health care and education, accurate passports, and censorship on federal websites of accurate terms to describe transgender people including on health agency sites, a \u201cstop bullying\u201d site, the site to protect missing and exploited children, and the National Park Service\u2019s site for the Stonewall National Monument.\n\u201cThe flurry of government actions directed at transgender persons\u2014denying them everything from necessary medical care to access to homeless shelters\u2014must give pause to any court asked to consider whether one such order under review furthers a legitimate government interest free of animus.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re grateful our plaintiffs, and all transgender members of the military, are protected from this egregious ban,\u201d the National Center for Lesbian Rights stated in a post on Bluesky.\n\n\u201cWhen you put on the uniform, differences fall away and what matters is your ability to do the job,\u201d said Nicolas Talbott, Second Lieutenant, Army, whose name is on the lawsuit challenging the order.\n\n\u201cMy being transgender has no bearing on my dedication to the mission, my commitment to my unit, or my ability to perform my duties in accordance with the high standards expected of me and every servicemember,\u201d Lt.

That\u2019s just wrong \u2014 and it destabilizes our armed forces.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis ruling shows the Trump administration\u2019s discriminatory attempt to bar transgender Americans from serving in the military is unconstitutional and does nothing to make our country safer and stronger,\u201d GLAAD President and CEO Sarah Kate Ellis said.\n\n\u201cTransgender military members are already serving capably and honorably, having met the required rigorous health and readiness standards,\u201d Ellis continued. \u201cThe current \u2018commander in chief\u2019 and his staff continue to threaten our national defense with this baseless disinformation campaign against their fellow Americans.
