  "content": "Maine Democrats want to amend the state constitution to permanently allow transgender-identifying males to compete in female sports.\n\nMaine\u2019s Democrat House Majority voted on Thursday to pass a bill that would codify the Maine Human Rights Act (MHRA) in the state\u2019s constitution. The proposed bill, LD 260, passed with a slim majority and will ultimately need two-thirds majority in both chambers before it can go before voters, Fox News reported. \n\nState officials have cited the MHRA in their ongoing dispute with the Trump administration over its allowance of males in female sports and spaces. MHRA is the state\u2019s anti-discrimination law, and lawmakers added \u201cgender identity\u201d protections in 2021. \n\n\u201cOur position is that Title IX, consistent with the Maine Human Rights Act, so both federal and state law, supports that trans girls will be able to participate in high school sports consistent with their gender identity,\u201d Maine Attorney General Aaron Frey said in a recent CNN interview. \u201cSo my contention is Maine is following Title IX, Maine is following the Maine Human Rights Act.\u201d  \n\nAt the same time, Maine Republicans are working to strip \u201cgender identity\u201d from the law.\n\nThe state House voted on the legislation one day after the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) filed a lawsuit against Maine for its refusal to comply with President Trump\u2019s executive order \u201cKeeping Men Out of Women\u2019s Sports,\u201d which interprets Title IX to prohibit the inclusion of males in female sports.\n\nThe DOJ\u2019s complaint accuses Maine of \u201copenly and defiantly flouting federal anti-discrimination law.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy prioritizing gender identity over biological reality, Maine\u2019s policies deprive girl athletes of fair competition, deny them equal athletic opportunities, and expose them to heightened risks of physical injury and physiological harm,\u201d the complaint reads.\n\nRELATED: Boy Wins High School Girls\u2019 Pole Vault Competition in Maine After State Pledged to Flout Trump Order\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s executive order was created to protect female student athletes from having \u201cto compete with or against or having to appear unclothed before males.\u201d The order also mandates each federal department to \u201creview grants to education programs and, where appropriate, rescind funding to programs that fail to comply with the policy established in this order,\u201d which protects women \u201cas a matter of safety, fairness, dignity, and truth.\u201d\n\nFollowing Trump\u2019s order, Maine officials publicly said they would not comply, siding with transgender-identifying males over women and girls and citing state law allowing students to play on teams that match their \u201cgender identity.\u201d\n\nThen a transgender-identifying boy claimed the victory in the Maine Class B championship for the Greely High School girls\u2019 track and field team in February.\n\nPresident Trump and Gov. Janet Mills had a public spat on February 20, during which he said at the Republican Governor\u2019s Association dinner that Maine is at risk of losing federal funding if the state continues to allow males to play on female sports teams.\n\n\u201cWe are the federal law. You better do it, because you\u2019re not gonna get any federal funding if you don\u2019t\u2026 your population also doesn\u2019t want men in women\u2019s sports,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou better comply, or you\u2019re not getting any federal funding.\u201d\n\n\u201cSee you in court,\u201d Mills replied.\n\n\u201cGood. See you in court, that should be a real easy one,\u201d Trump fired back. \u201cEnjoy your life after, governor. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be in elected office.\u201d\n\nBoth the Department of Education and Department of Health and Human Services subsequently launched investigations into the state and ultimately found the Maine Department of Education and other entities in violation of Title IX.\n\nThe Department of Education recently began the process of cutting federal K-12 funding to Maine over the transgender debate.
