  "content": "XX-XY Athletics founder Jennifer Sey slammed Nike over its alleged funding of a study on puberty blockers for children and how it would affect their athletic and training performance.\n\nThe research is looking to discover how much medical intervention there needs to be for a male to \"fairly\" compete in girls\u2019 and women\u2019s sports. \n\nThe first notion that Nike was allegedly funding was in a New York Times article published over the weekend about the plight of Blaire Fleming \u2013 the San Jose State Spartans transgender female volleyball player who played a controversial role in the 2024-25 NCAA women\u2019s volleyball season.\n\nA Nike swoosh logo at Nike by Eugene. (Kirby Lee-USA Today Sports)\n\nOutKick pointed out that the piece mentions Joanna Harper, a trans woman who studies transgender athletes, is \"currently helping to lead an ambitious study of trans adolescents that measures their results on a 10-step fitness test before they start hormone therapy and then, after they have begun to medically transition, every six months for five years.\"\n\nThe article then read, \"But, she told me when we talked in February, \u2018the current climate makes the study somewhat uncertain.\u2019 I assumed she was referring to the Trump administration\u2019s cuts to National Institutes of Health research grants, but she said money was not a problem: The study is being funded by Nike. The problem was Trump\u2019s separate order targeting medical care for transgender youth. \u2018If we can\u2019t perform gender-affirming care,\u2019 she explained, \u2018then we can\u2019t bring people into the study.\"\n\nFox News Digital has reached out to Nike for comment. The company has not yet to offer any clarification on the matter, according to OutKick.\n\nSey appeared on \"Don\u2019t @ Me with Dan Dakich\" and completely eviscerated the idea of the study even happening.\n\nJennifer Sey founed XX-XY Athletics in March 2024. The message of the name of the brand \"is that there is empirical truth. Biology is true,\" she said. (XX-XY Athletics)\n\n\"She\u2019s trying to understand what they call \u2018retained male advantage\u2019 and is there little enough of it that these boys can pass for competing with girls,\" Sey said. It\u2019s so wrong on so many levels. . . . Why is a shoe brand involved in this at all?\n\n\"But from a women\u2019s and girls\u2019 perspective, we are not impaired boys. It\u2019s so degrading to think of us that way. Would we do a study that says, \u2018How many fingers can we cut off of a boy to make it OK for him to compete in tennis with a girl?\u2019 That\u2019s what we\u2019re doing here. Outside of the fact that why is Nike incentivizing this kind of work? This experimental medical treatment of young boys that disfigures them and sterilizes them for life.\"\n\nSey said she thought the decision to fund a study like this may have happened years ago.\n\n\"Senior executives probably didn\u2019t know what was happening. This is something that happened deep in the organization,\" Sey suggested. \"And this Harper thought, he was proud of it, and he talked about it. . . . I believe Nike is like, \u2018Oh, crap.
