(RELATED: Nebraska\u2019s Stand with Women Act Opposed by Faith Leaders)\n\nThe few pols who have woken up and smelled the polling have proved to be lonely \u2014 and abandoned \u2014 figures.

A tsunami of a different sort \u2014 of blowback \u2014 mussed Newsom\u2019s hairdo.

Maine Gov. Janet Mills, who got into it with President Trump at the White House over males playing women\u2019s sports in her state, defied a Trump executive order and got her state denied federal school funding (the issue is now in the courts). Minnesota says it won\u2019t comply with Trump\u2019s EO, and the California Assembly recently voted down bills banning transgender participation in women\u2019s sports in the Golden State.

Why cannot Dems bring themselves to abandon such a transparently destructive political position?\n\nWell, there is the backlash. We mentioned the hurricane-force winds of disdain Newsom\u2019s coiffure had to endure, but Moulton also faced tirades from fellow Democrats for simply saying the party should be broad-minded enough to at least discuss the issue.
