In his speech, Fern\u00e1ndez acknowledged that gender dysphoria \u201cmanifests itself even from childhood\u201d and may cause \u201cdeep suffering.\u201d\n\n\u201c[T]here are cases outside the norm, such as strong dysphorias that can lead to an unbearable existence or even suicide. These exceptional situations must be evaluated with great care,\u201d Fern\u00e1ndez told the conference.\n\nBut Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s support only went so far. The cardinal also warned that medically transitioning represents \u201cthe right to a change of identity, the desire to be a different person,\u201d which he deemed unacceptable. That degree of self-determination, he said, was a \u201cclaim to omnipotence\u201d by trans people who wish to \u201ccreate an alternative reality at will.\u201d\n\nFern\u00e1ndez\u2019s comments, though they appear to incrementally soften the Catholic Church\u2019s stance on trans identities, echo similar comments made by Pope Francis in the past. Francis has been a frequently confounding presence in the Vatican, regularly meeting for meals with a group of trans women while reportedly decrying homosexuality within the Church and referring to \u201cgender ideology\u201d as a threat to religious order. He famously compared trans people to nuclear weapons in 2015, and said that medical transition is \u201ca new sin, that against God the Creator.\u201d\n\nBut Francis has also appeared to split hairs between the material treatment of trans people individually and his conception of so-called \u201cgender ideology.\u201d The Pope told a Catholic activist in 2024 that while trans people \u201cmust be accepted and integrated into society,\u201d he considers \u201cgender ideology\u201d to be a secular philosophy that \u201cnullifies differences\u201d between genders, rendering \u201ceveryone equal without respect for personal history.\u201d\n\nAt time of writing, Francis has been hospitalized for nearly three weeks with double pneumonia. The group of trans women with whom Francis meets for pasta told the Washington Post this week that they are praying for his recovery.\n\n\u201cIn this COVID period, it was important that Pope Francis got inside the mind of transgender women, in the mind of the human beings that we are, and started to treat us like human beings,\u201d Carla Segovia told the Post, adding that she wanted to \u201ctransmit to him our strength, the same thing that he brought to us in the difficult time of the pandemic. We want to inoculate him with this strength that is so crucial \u2014 the fact that you need to fight for your life.\u201d",
