These ordinances, which have overwhelming bipartisan support, were passed with one clear goal: to protect children and teenagers from conversion therapy\u2014a harmful practice that has been repeatedly condemned by every major medical and mental health organization in the U.S.\n\nSince Kansas City passed its ban in 2019, and Jackson County followed suit in 2023, these ordinances have represented a crucial step in affirming the right of LGBTQ people, particularly youth, to live authentically and free from coercion or abuse. They reflect an understanding that conversion therapy causes devastating harm, contributing to depression, anxiety, homelessness, and tragically, suicide. Studies show that 25% of LGBTQ youth who had undergone conversion therapy had attempted suicide within the previous 12 months\u2014a stark reminder of the irreversible damage these practices cause.\n\nAccording The Trevor Project, nearly 1 in 3 LGBTQ young people said their mental health was poor most of the time or always due to anti-LGBTQ policies and legislation, including conversion therapy.\n\nThe legal challenge by Missouri\u2019s Attorney General could have devastating consequences for LGBTQ youth, who are already at higher risk for mental health struggles and violence. Experts agree that rather than helping individuals, conversion therapy compounds the emotional and psychological trauma faced by LGBTQ people, particularly young people who are still finding their identity.\n\nIn the face of these efforts to roll back protections, the LGBTQ+ community is standing firm. Advocates are doubling down on their commitment to protecting LGBTQ+ youth, ensuring that harmful practices like conversion therapy have no place in Missouri\u2014and beyond.\n\nThis fight isn\u2019t just about one city or one county\u2014it\u2019s about the rights of LGBTQ people everywhere to live without fear of harm or discrimination. The community\u2019s response has been swift and resolute: \u201cWe will not allow our youth to be subjected to this abuse. We will continue to fight for their safety and dignity,\u201d Horn stated.\n\nThe movement to end conversion therapy is gaining momentum across the country, with more and more states passing laws to protect LGBTQ youth from these discredited practices. But the Missouri lawsuit serves as a stark reminder that the fight for LGBTQ rights is ongoing, and that progress must be fiercely defended.\n\nAs the case unfolds, the LGBTQ community remains united in its commitment to ensuring a future where all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity, can live their truth without fear of rejection, harm, or violence.",
