  "content": "In a landmark decision issued late Friday, a federal judge granted a preliminary injunction blocking the Trump administration\u2019s passport policy targeting transgender Americans. The executive order, which required that passport gender markers reflect a person\u2019s assigned sex at birth, effectively reversed three decades of precedent and left many applications stalled in bureaucratic limbo. The judge ruled the policy was \u201carbitrary and capricious,\u201d likely in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, the Paperwork Reduction Act, and the equal protection clause of the U.S. Constitution. The judge also ruled that the decision was based in animus and discrimination towards transgender people. While the injunction currently applies only to the named plaintiffs, a broader ruling protecting all transgender Americans is expected in the coming weeks.\n\n\u201cThe plaintiffs have also demonstrated a likelihood of success on their separate argument that, under any standard of review, the Executive Order and Passport Policy are based on irrational prejudice toward transgender Americans and therefore offend our Nation\u2019s constitutional commitment to equal protection for all Americans. In addition, the plaintiffs have shown that they are likely to succeed on their claim that the Passport Policy is arbitrary and capricious, and that it was not adopted in compliance with the procedures required by the Paperwork Reduction Act and Administrative Procedure Act,\u201d ruled the judge.\n\nThe judge, when evaluating whether or not the transgender plaintiffs were being discriminated against in a way that likely violates their equal protection under the law, ruled that they likely were. This is because the order targets transgender people based on sex, an act that triggers a higher degree of constitutional scrutiny: \u201cAs to the first policy change, applicants are explicitly treated differently based on their sex assigned at birth. A person who identifies as female can receive a passport marked \u201cF\u201d if her sex assigned at birth was female, but not if her sex assigned at birth was male. Likewise, a person who identifies as male can receive a passport marked \u201cM\u201d if his sex assigned at birth was male, but not if his sex assigned at birth was female\u2026 Viewed from any angle, that amounts to a classification based on sex.\u201d\n\nOnce the judge determined that the policy classified on sex, the government must prove that it used the least restrictive way to achieve an important government objective in an \u201cexceedingly persuasive manner.\u201d The Trump executive order argued that the change was needed to protect the safety of cisgender women. The judge found this unpersuasive, ruling, \u201cThere is no connection between the State Department\u2019s prior policy\u2014which allowed applicants to obtain personal-use passports consistent with their gender identity\u2014and any deprivation of cisgender women\u2019s dignity, safety, and well-being\u2026 marriages)\u2026. The government further offers no explanation for how a policy that allowed all individuals to obtain passports reflective of their gender identity had a \u201ccorrosive impact\u201d on women and \u201cthe validity of the entire American system.\u201d EO \u00a7 1. Any such argument would strain logic, and so it is not surprising that the government does not try to justify the Passport Policy by reference to the stated purposes of the Executive Order.\u201d\n\nThe judge also found that the administration\u2019s decision to block passport gender marker changes for transgender people was rooted in anti-transgender animus, rendering the policy likely unconstitutional under any level of judicial scrutiny. In reaching this conclusion, the ruling considered not only the passport policy in isolation, but its context alongside other contemporaneous executive actions\u2014most notably, the transgender military ban, in which the government argued that transgender individuals were inherently dishonorable and untruthful. These actions, the judge wrote, \u201cconvey a fundamental moral disapproval of transgender Americans.\u201d\n\nThe judge also ruled that the passport ban was arbitrary and capricious, failing to meet the standards required by the Administrative Procedures Act and the Paperwork Reduction Act. Major rule changes typically require agencies to post proposed changes to the Federal Register, allow for public comment, and assess stakeholder input before altering official forms or procedures. The Trump administration bypassed that process entirely, imposing the passport policy by executive fiat\u2014banning transgender people from receiving passports with accurate gender markers with the stroke of a pen. \u201cThere is no evidence before the Court that, in adopting the Passport Policy, the Agency Defendants took steps to identify facts bearing on its policy change, attempted to identify potential reliance interests, or sought to determine how any such interests may be impacted by the policy changes,\u201d the judge wrote.\n\nFollowing these determinations, the judge ruled in favor of a preliminary injunction blocking the new passport policy. Though the ruling currently applies only to the plaintiffs, it is widely expected to expand in the coming weeks to cover the full class of transgender Americans.
