  "content": "California governor Gavin Newsom repeatedly agreed with MAGA pundit and Turning Point USA co-founder Charlie Kirk on the issue of trans people in sports in an interview on the debut episode of Newsom\u2019s new podcast, which premiered Thursday March 6.\n\nWhile speaking to Kirk for the first episode of This Is Gavin Newsom, the Democratic politican sought advice from the conservative pundit about reaching out to young voters, given that Republicans made steep inroads with the youth vote in the 2024 election. Kirk responded that Newsom and the Democrats must \u201cget better ideas\u201d but also \u201crun to the middle,\u201d which is when the right-wing political activist brought up the issue of trans athletes in sports.\n\n\u201cYou right now should come out and be like, \u2018The young man that\u2019s about to win the state championship in the long jump in female sports, that shouldn\u2019t happen,\u201d Kirk said. \u201cYou as the governor should step up and say no.\u201d\n\nAfter this more oblique reference, Kirk specifically called out the trans athlete \u2014 who has become a target for tabloids and right-wing publications \u2014 by name, then asked whether Newsom would consider coming out against trans athletes in sports.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s an issue of fairness, I completely agree with you on that. It is an issue of fairness \u2014 it\u2019s deeply unfair,\u201d Newsom said. \u201cI am not wrestling with the fairness issue. I totally agree with you.\u201d\n\nApparently sensing that he has an opportunity to sway the governor, Kirk then appealed to Newsom as the father of two daughters, while noting that Kirk is a father to a daughter himself.\n\n\u201cI revere sports, so the issue of fairness is completely legit,\u201d Newsom said.\n\nDespite Newsom\u2019s claim that fairness concerns are \u201ccompletely legit,\u201d, several studies maintain that there is no scientific basis for banning trans women from playing sports with cis women and that trans women may, in fact, face several competitive disadvantages in competition against cis women.\n\nNewsom went on to say that Republicans were \u201cable to weaponize that issue\u201d in the recent election cycle, but eventually walked even that mild criticism back when Kirk called it out for being too harsh.\n\n\u201cNot weaponize,\u201d Kirk said. \u201cShine a light on.\u201d\n\n\u201cHighlight in a way,\u201d Newsom agreed.\n\nWhile Newsom said many times that he agrees with Kirk on the issue,, he did ask Kirk about the human side of the issue. Referring to the trans community as \u201cthese poor people,\u201d Newsom said, \u201cThese poor people are more likely to commit suicide, have anxiety and depression. The way people talk down to vulnerable communities is an issue that I have a hard time with, as well. So both things I can hold in my hand. How can we address this issue with the kind of decency that I think is inherent in you, but not always expressed on the issue?\u201d\n\nKirk, however, sidestepped this question, calling trans athletes in sports an \u201c80/20 issue\u201d that Democrats are losing.\n\nMaine\u2019s Governor Stood Up to Trump\u2019s Anti-Trans Order. The State Is Now Under Investigation\n\u201cSee you in court,\u201d Maine Governor Janet Mills said after Trump threatened to cut the state\u2019s federal funding if it didn\u2019t comply with his executive order attempting to ban trans girls and women from sports.\n\u201cYou guys are giving us an 80/20 issue that is just permeating the country, and is such an affront to our senses,\u201d Kirk said. The right-wing pundit went on to deride Democrats who banned together to oppose a Republican-led bill in the United States Senate that would have banned schools receiving federal funding from allowing trans athletes to compete in women\u2019s sports.\n\nThroughout the interview, Newsom tried to bring up his advocacy for the LGBTQ+ community, including when he defied federal law to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples in California. However, he also allowed Kirk to essentially steamroll him several times on key conservative issues, especially pertaining to college students and college campuses.\n\n\u201cYou go to CalTech to study computer engineering and applied AI, next thing you know, you\u2019re crushing it, right?\u201d Kirk said. \u201cYou go to Cal to study North African lesbian poetry \u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cIs that an actual degree?\u201d Newsom responded.\n\n\u201cYou tell me, governor,\u201d Kirk said, prompting Newsom to laugh. \u201cThe fact that you don\u2019t know \u2026 it should be like, \u2018No way!\u2019 The fact that it\u2019s a \u2018maybe,\u2019 we\u2019ve got some problems.\u201d\n\nNewsom\u2019s comments come less than two weeks after Maine governor Janet Mills defied President Trump on his executive order banning trans girls from playing the sport that matches their gender.
