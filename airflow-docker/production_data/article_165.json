Georgia just decided that 1.7M people will be forced to change their health insurance because GA bureaucrats decided to mix their liberal agenda with a state procurement,\u201d Conservative journalist and political commentator Jack Posobiec said in a post to X, bringing attention to the transgender facet of the story, which was not reported on by local media. \u201cThis is ACTUAL text of the use of a transgender question to spend tax dollars.\u201d \n\nThe question (linked in AJC\u2019s reporting), obtained from a Sentara Health Care (one of the insurers who was not awarded a contact) complaint protesting the state\u2019s decision and asking the Department of Administrative Services to start the process over reads:\n\nA fourteen (14) year-old, transgender White female (assigned male sex at birth but identifies as a female) member living in a rural area has been diagnosed with major depressive disorder. She has been seeing a therapist in another town but has missed recent outpatient sessions. In addition, she has anorexia nervosa and will additionally require cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), group therapy, physical exams, labs and other care. She has two younger siblings, and she shares a bedroom with her younger brother. Her family lives 40 minutes from her provider and 2 hours from the nearest hospital, in rural Southern Georgia. Describe the Supplier\u2019s approach to engaging the member in a course of treatment. Include in the Supplier\u2019s response how the Supplier may coordinate both the use of telehealth and in-person appointments to deliver care and ensure care continuity.\n\n\u201cSoooo GA bureaucrats decided to base potential life saving healthcare decisions for 1.7 million people on one dysphoric person? Did I get that right, Brian Kemp?\u201d former NCAA swimming champion and women\u2019s sports activist Riley Gaines reacted. \n\n\u201cThe woke mind virus is alive and well\u2026in Georgia,\u201d Chair of Students for Trump Ryan Fournier responded. \u201cWhat\u2019s with this absurd transgender test the State of Georgia is using to spend tax dollars? The Brian Kemp team is asleep at the wheel.\u201d\n\nBreitbart News reached out to Gov. Kemp\u2019s office for comment about the transgender-related question in procurement. Kemp spokesperson Garrison Douglas said \u201cthe governor does not play a role in the state\u2019s Medicaid procurement process.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat said, after signing numerous pieces of legislation effectively banning boys from playing in girls\u2019 sports, outlawing medical procedures that permanently mutilate the bodies of our children, and prohibiting indoctrination in our classrooms, the facts and Governor Kemp\u2019s record on this issue is clear and unwavering,\u201d Douglas added. \n\nIt should be noted that in 2022, the ACLU settled a lawsuit with the Georgia Department of Community Health over its exclusion of so-called \u201cgender-affirming surgery\u201d in the state\u2019s Medicaid program. According to the ACLU of Georgia, part of the settlement included the Department of Community Health removing its exclusion for transgender surgeries from Georgia Medicaid and including benefits and clinical guidelines for gender dysphoria treatment.\n\nAnother rejected insurer, Peach State, who has held a portion of the state\u2019s Medicaid contract since 2006 under the parent company Centene, said in its 48-page complaint (also linked in AJC\u2019s coverage) that while questions around hypothetical scenarios are not uncommon in the process, \u201cat least one evaluation question appears politically motivated and designed to draw responses to \u2018test\u2019 the Supplier\u2019s progressive leanings.\u201d The insurer was specifically referring to the transgender-related question.\n\n\u201cIt is not uncommon for evaluation questions in a Medicaid managed care procurement to include hypothetical scenarios to which the proposer is asked to respond. But the number of extreme scenarios presented in this procurement is atypical from national norms and suggests an underlying agenda that has no place in a competitive procurement for taxpayer-funded healthcare services,\u201d the complaint reads. \n\nBreitbart News reached out to the Georgia Department of Community Health and the Georgia Department of Administrative Services for an explanation but did not receive a response by time of publication. At least two state evaluators allegedly involved in the process and listed in rejected insurers complaints appear to have donated to ActBlue, per Federal Election Commission (FEC) filings.\n\nIn its legal filing, Peach State said it currently covers more than 700,000 Georgians and alleged that its ousting would \u201cupend the way vulnerable Georgians receive their healthcare.\u201d\n\n \u201cGeorgia has never experienced a disruption of this magnitude,\u201d the complaint alleges, further warning that a change would force 1.17 million Georgia Medicaid recipients to change health care providers and leave others with gaps in coverage. \n\n\u201cThe Georgians who rely on these important programs for their healthcare, and the taxpayers who pay for these programs, deserve better,\u201d the filing reads. \n\nIn contrast, the successful bidders \u2014 CareSource, Humana Employers Health Plan of Georgia, Molina Health Care and United Health Care of Georgia \u2014 say they will implement a streamlined system to provide health coverage to poor children and adults, including disabled people, and elderly people in nursing homes, AJC reported.\n\nCurrently, Georgia pays three insurance firms more than $4 billion a year to run the federal-state health programs, according to AJC.\n\n\u201cPeach State Health Plan manages care for roughly 45 percent of Georgia\u2019s Medicaid patients; Amerigroup covers 30 percent; and CareSource oversees about 25 percent,\u201d the report states. \u201cAmerigroup also handles the smaller contract for Georgia Families 360, which covers health care for about 33,000 foster care children and young adults.\u201d\n\nThe bidding war began in September of 2023, when the state\u2019s health agency sought proposals to manage Georgia Families, a program \u201cwhich covers Georgia Medicaid and PeachCare recipients, and Georgia Families 360, which covers children, teens and young adults in foster care,\u201d according to the report. The state also said it plans to move approximately 200,000 elderly, blind, and disabled people into managed care agreements under the new contracts.\n\n\u201cMuch is on the line. Georgia expects to spend about $4.5 billion on Medicaid and PeachCare, the program for uninsured kids, in the next year. The Medicaid program is administered jointly by federal and state governments, so the feds chip in billions of dollars more,\u201d according to the report.\n\nRenu Gupta, an office manager for one of South Georgia\u2019s largest psychiatric practices, told the outlet she is one of several health care providers who opposes the overhaul.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not easy to deal with insurance companies, and I\u2019m worried it\u2019s going to be a terrible transition,\u201d Gupta said. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair for the doctors or their practices. And, I\u2019m telling you, these patients are going to suffer for it.\u201d",
