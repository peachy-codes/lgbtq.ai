  "content": "A transgender high school girl in Virginia has been effectively forced to join a boys\u2019 track and field team after state authorities introduced new restrictions on trans athletes to align with the Trump administration earlier this year.\n\nIn a profile for the Washington Post this week, Eliza Munshi, a senior at Falls Church High School in Virginia, said that she applied to join the girls\u2019 track team in early February. Munshi said she was inspired to join following news reports that the Virginia High School League (VHSL), the nonprofit organization which governs K-12 school sports in the state, would not change its trans-inclusive policies \u2014 most significantly a waiver process by which trans girls could apply to compete on girls\u2019 teams \u2014 to adhere to President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order seeking to ban trans women from women\u2019s sports leagues.\n\nBut the VHSL reversed that statement just days later, as Virginia Public Media (VPM) reported. Munshi told the Post that during her fourth practice with the girls\u2019 team, adults abruptly informed her she would no longer be allowed to compete with them. Along with an eight-point test governing trans boys\u2019 eligibility for boys\u2019 sports teams, the VHSL\u2019s updated handbook now specifies that trans girls \u201cmay not participate on a girls sports team other than cheerleading,\u201d specifically citing Trump\u2019s February executive order. Another section of the rulebook, which was already in place, notes that if an athlete who is \u201cofficially declared ineligible\u201d competes anyway, the athlete\u2019s \u201cschool shall be automatically suspended from the League for a period of one calendar year\u201d unless their participation was required by a court order.\n\n\u201c[W]e really felt like if we\u2019re to be the governing body of the Virginia High School League, our policies need to be in compliance with the executive order,\u201d VHSL executive director Billy Haun told VPM in a statement in February, \u201cso that our member schools and school divisions wouldn't have to choose between the league and the executive order.\u201d (Haun is VHSL\u2019s outgoing executive director, and is set to hand over the reins to current Assistant Director of Compliance Ty Gafford in July.)\n\nNot wanting her participation to negatively affect her friends on the girls\u2019 team, Munshi told her coach she would compete on the boys\u2019 team instead. She told the Post that despite the policy changes, everyone at her school has continued to make her feel welcome. \u201cSometimes I forget I\u2019m transgender. People around me forget too,\u201d she wrote last year in a college admissions essay, per the Post.\n\nLegally speaking, executive orders do not directly compel compliance outside of the executive branch of the federal government. But since taking office, the Trump administration has leaned on many such orders \u2014 some of which have already been blocked pending litigation \u2014 to demand state and local entities adhere to his sweeping anti-trans agend, or risk losing all federal funding. Trump has used his order regarding trans athletes in particular to threaten lawsuits and loss of funding for the University of Pennsylvania and multiple educational bodies across Maine for alleged noncompliance with his interpretation of Title IX civil rights law. The NCAA voluntarily altered its own participation rules to adhere to Trump\u2019s order earlier this year. Meanwhile, two teens in New Hampshire are challenging Trump\u2019s sports order in court, along with a state law that bars them from competing in girls\u2019 leagues.\n\nState and local bans on trans girls in K-12 and college sports continue to proliferate across the U.S., as conservatives have latched onto the topic as a useful wedge issue against LGBTQ+ rights. Such bans are often justified with assertions that trans girls have a \u201cbiological advantage\u201d over their cis peers in sports, even if they have received puberty blockers or hormone therapy to suppress testosterone levels. Those claims are not supported by current research. In fact, a 2024 study backed by the International Olympic Committee found that trans women who have suppressed their testosterone may face competitive disadvantages compared to cis women in some key metrics like vertical leap. (The Post reported that one of Munshi\u2019s best discus throws measure just shy of 47 feet; the current U.S. high school girls\u2019 record for discus throw is 193 feet and eight inches, set by athlete Emma Sralla in 2023.)\n\n\u201cThe way I kind of look at this right now is advanced compliance before all the legal maneuvering is done, and before courts have made their final decisions,\u201d said State Sen. Danica Roem, considered the first trans state lawmaker in U.S. history, in comments to VPM about VHSL\u2019s policy changes in February. \u201cI think it is going to cause actual harm to the people who are most vulnerable right now.\u201d",
