  "content": "When C.J. Parker got his new passport in the mail, he was initially in disbelief. Parker thought that the contents of the UPS envelope that he had opened must have been a mistake: The 27-year-old\u2019s corrected birth certificate and a court order certifying his name and gender change had seemingly been destroyed. The judge\u2019s order was ripped in two with a piece missing, meaning Parker couldn\u2019t just tape it back together. His birth certificate was not only torn but it also appeared to have been partially burned; tiny black flakes spilled onto his kitchen table. And the passport he had received was itself unusable: The cover was deformed and melted.\n\n\u201cI, at first, tried to say, \u2018Well, maybe it was an accident. Maybe it got stuck in a printer.\u2019 That was my first thought,\u201d Parker, who requested to go by a pseudonym due to fear of retaliation, tells Them. He soon realized that the now-ruined paperwork was everything he owned that legally certified his gender as a trans man. \u201cRegardless of what happened, somebody took all of these documents and put them in the envelope and sent them to me that way, fully knowingly.\u201d\n\nMaking matters worse, Parker\u2019s new passport had the wrong gender marker listed on it: a jarring \u201cF\u201d where he had hoped that an \u201cM\u201d would be. He was still convinced that he must have hallucinated what had happened when he telephoned his state representative for help. The lawmaker became silent over the phone as he explained the situation, and when she expressed that she was at a loss for words, the moment\u2019s enormity hit him, and he suddenly started to sob. The deluge of grief startled him: Parker has never been prone to tears, and starting testosterone, he says, has made it near-impossible to cry.\n\nSpeaking over the phone with Them from his home, Parker says his heart is still racing as he talks about it. He says he feels stuck in place, as if he is sinking lower and lower into the floor. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m losing it,\u201d he says. \u201cI keep having moments where I think, \u2018Someone couldn\u2019t have done that. Someone wouldn\u2019t do that. Then I look at it and I say, \u2018No, I am looking at exactly what I\u2019m looking at. One plus one equals two.\u2019\u201d\n\nThese emotions are sadly familiar for many trans Americans who have been denied corrected passports since President Donald Trump\u2019s second inauguration in January. Just one day after Trump resumed office, he issued an executive order directing the State Department to halt all updates to gender markers on U.S. passports and discontinue the gender-neutral \u201cX\u201d designation. Following that guidance, numerous trans, nonbinary, and intersex people have reported receiving inaccurate gender markers on their passports, including Euphoria actress Hunter Schafer, who called the situation a \u201charsh reality check\u201d in a since-deleted TikTok video.\n\n\u201cYou know how they say that when a child is in danger, a mom could lift a bus off them, from the force of adrenaline? I feel like right now I\u2019m tasked with lifting the entire White House and everyone in it off of my daughter.\u201d\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) is currently suing the Trump administration on behalf of seven plaintiffs who were all denied passports that reflect their lived identities as trans people. In a statement, the ACLU describes the refusal of accurate documentation as a \u201cchaotic policy clearly motivated by animus that serves zero public interest\u201d and a \u201cblatant effort to violate their privacy and deny [trans people] their freedom to be themselves.\u201d\n\nAs the ACLU\u2019s lawsuit moves through the courts, trans people and their loved ones say that the inability to get accurate passports has destabilized their lives and made their futures uncertain. In states that place burdensome restrictions on updating birth certificates, driver\u2019s licenses, and state IDs, applying for a corrected passport has, for many, served as the safer and easier alternative. In 2021, the Biden administration announced that it would no longer require trans people to provide medical documentation certifying their transition before being granted a corrected passport. Under Biden, in 2021, the State Department said that it would begin issuing \u201cX\u201d gender markers following a years-long lawsuit from intersex activist Dana Zzyym.\n\nLacking access to those documents, as sources tell Them, makes it harder for trans people to move through the world without issue. After being sent an inaccurate passport in February, 29-year-old Lily Powers said that she worries about \u201csticking out like a sore thumb\u201d while passing through airport security. \u201cI don\u2019t want someone to see me when I\u2019m traveling and have a reason to question me,\u201d she said. \u201cFor me to have an \u2018M\u2019 on my passport puts me in danger immediately.\u201d\n\nPowers had been crossing her fingers, hoping that she might somehow slip through the cracks of the new administration\u2019s policies. She filed her application for a corrected passport at the beginning of January, and a few days before Trump\u2019s inauguration, Powers called the U.S. Passport Office and told them that she planned to visit a friend in Canada, hoping that her correction would then be expedited. But when she received an inaccurate passport three weeks later, Powers also received a notice from the Bureau of Consular Affairs detailing why she had received an \u201cM\u201d on her documents. On the sheet, an agent had circled two phrases: \u201cSex\u201d and \u201cTo Match Our Records.\u201d\n\n\u201ct felt like I\u2019ve been let down by my government. It felt like I\u2019d been let down by the American people. It felt like I was being rejected and ostracized by society at large for simply trying to exist.\u201d\n\nBefore this incident, Powers said that transitioning had been a wholly positive experience. She had been severely depressed before coming out as a trans woman, and she credits her transition with saving her life. \u201cI\u2019m happier than I\u2019ve ever been because I\u2019ve chosen to live and be happy,\u201d Powers says. \u201cAs someone who\u2019s a little more than three and a half years into her transition, it\u2019s really, really frustrating to be slapped in the face with this.\u201d\n\nAlthough Powers said that she was just beginning the long journey of updating her documents, what concerns Eris Discordia Montano, 53, is that the vast majority of her other identification accurately reflects her gender. Montano has an \u201cF\u201d on her driver\u2019s license and in the national Social Security database. If someone were to question why her documents don\u2019t match, such as a TSA agent or even a potential employer, Montano said that the answer could prove a problem for her. \u201cIt's a terrible, terrifying feeling,\u201d she tells Them.\n\nWhen the \u201cM\u201d passport was mailed to her ex-wife\u2019s house in February, Montano flashed back to the despair she felt after the 2024 presidential election: the knowledge that, while she would survive the casual brutality of the next four years, she didn\u2019t want to be forced to do so. \u201cIt felt like I\u2019ve been let down by my government,\u201d Montano says. \u201cIt felt like I\u2019d been let down by the American people. It felt like I was being rejected and ostracized by society at large for simply trying to exist.\u201d\n\nFor parents with trans kids, restricting the ability to apply for corrected passports makes it more difficult for them to plan for worst-case scenarios. In the early days of his new term, Trump enacted a series of orders targeting both trans youth and adults, including threatening health practitioners that provide gender-affirming care to minors with the loss of federal funding and limiting sports participation for trans student athletes. His administration is also punishing schools that permit trans students to \u201csocially transition\u201d on campus and erasing federal resources geared toward the LGBTQ+ community, such as removing mentions of queer youth from StopBullying.gov\n\nFearing how bad things might get under another Trump presidency, Lisa Suhay, 59, paid what she describes as \u201cexorbitant\u201d fees to expedite her 19-year-old daughter Mellow\u2019s first-ever passport. Suhay hoped to be able to rush the application through, but the day Trump\u2019s directive hit, they had to make a tough choice: Would they change the application to an \u201cM\u201d marker or risk the passport being rejected altogether? Fearing that a lack of documentation could jeopardize the possibility of fleeing the country in an emergency, they decided to play it safe with a male passport.\n\nWhile Mellow says that it\u2019s \u201cdisturbing\u201d that she has to be legally misgendered for her own safety, her mother notes that they are in uncharted waters. She says that she has called numerous attorneys, and no one can give her family a clear answer as to how they should navigate the \u201chorrific legal situation\u201d the country finds itself in. Suhay says that, some days, it feels like they\u2019re caught in a trap. \u201cYou know how they say that when a child is in danger, a mom could lift a bus off them, from the force of adrenaline?\u201d she tells Them. \u201cI feel like right now I\u2019m tasked with lifting the entire White House and everyone in it off of my daughter.\u201d\n\nThose affected by Trump\u2019s new passport policies said they are attempting to remain resilient and keep up the fight, but many admit that the past few weeks have been a low point. Fay Mortenson, 50, tells Them that she \u201cdropped to the floor sobbing\u201d after getting her 16-year-old son\u2019s passport back with an \u201cF\u201d on it. When she saw in the State Department\u2019s online database in February that the passport had been \u201capproved,\u201d Mortenson prayed that, for some reason, they had been spared the agonies others were suffering. She saw social media posts from trans people who had gotten their passports back damaged or had their applications put on hold, but just maybe, they got lucky. \u201cI had this tiny sliver of hope,\u201d she tells Them, \u201cand then it was just gone.\u201d\n\nMortenson, who asked to use a pseudonym for this story, says she has been attending rallies and vigils in her home state to regain her optimism, but she\u2019s finding it tough. She cycles through so many emotions throughout her day \u2014 rage, sadness, fear, and loneliness \u2014 but ultimately, she says she feels disoriented, as if the world around her is \u201cin this free fall and there\u2019s nobody to catch us right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople are just trying to live their lives,\u201d she says. \u201cIt is in no way a threat to anyone or anything for someone to have the correct documents. It\u2019s just cruel.\u201d\n\n",
