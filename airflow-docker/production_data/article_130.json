  "content": "The Trump administration has proposed a new rule that would prohibit health insurance plans under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) from classifying gender-affirming care as an essential health benefit (EHB), the latest of Republicans\u2019 attacks on transgender healthcare.\n\nProposed as part of a 300-page rules change package by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) on March 10, the draft rule does not ban gender-affirming care from insurance coverage outright, but would specifically block insurers \u201cfrom providing coverage for sex-trait modification as an EHB in any State\u201d beginning in 2026. The proposal uses the phrase \u201csex-trait modification\u201d in place of the term \u201cgender-affirming care,\u201d but does not offer a definition, instead requesting \u201cfeedback\u201d as to whether a definition should be formally adopted.\n\nUnder the ACA, insurance plans sold through the ACA marketplace are required to cover all EHBs as defined by the benchmarks of the state in which they operate. The rule, if enacted as proposed, would remove hormone replacement therapy, gender-affirming surgery, puberty blockers, and other forms of gender-affirming medical care from the list of valid EHBs. Insurers would still be allowed, but not required, to offer coverage for such care. (Other services excluded from EHB status include abortion care and non-pediatric dental or eye procedures.) As independent journalist Mady Castigan and policy analyst Corinne Green noted earlier this month, many insurance plans use EHB lists as guides even if they are not sold through the ACA marketplace, meaning that the rule could have much wider implications than its text alone suggests.\n\nAccording to data collected by the Movement Advancement Project, 24 states and the District of Columbia prohibit health care exclusions targeting trans people. Those states would be \u201crequired to defray the cost of that State-mandated benefit as it would be considered in addition to\u201d other mandated EHBs. The health policy research organization KFF noted this week that insurers in states that do not mandate such coverage could drop coverage of gender-affirming care from their plans altogether should the rule be adopted.\n\nAs justification for the new rule, CMS and HHS pointed to Trump\u2019s executive orders calling for gender-affirming care to be banned for trans youth and demanding an \u201cend to Federal funding of gender ideology.\u201d But although it parrots Trump\u2019s false definition of \u201cbiological sex\u201d (that people are immutably male or female based on whether they have \u201cthe biological function to produce\u201d sperm or eggs), the proposal claims that it is not subject to the injunctions blocking them, because it \u201cdoes not rely on the enjoined sections\u201d of those executive orders. Instead, the proposal further claims that gender-affirming care \u201cis not typically included in employer-sponsored plans, and EHB must be equal in scope to a typical employer plan\u201d \u2014 ergo, such care cannot be classed as an EHB.\n\nIn fact, it is not uncommon for employer-provided health plans in the U.S. to cover gender-affirming care, as KFF reported this week. Although coverage is uneven across the country, a 2024 KFF survey reported that about 24% of businesses with more than 200 employees cover gender-affirming care in their insurance policies. Among the country\u2019s largest businesses \u2014 those that employ more than 5,000 people \u2014 50% offered coverage for gender-affirming care in their largest plan.\n\nAlthough the Trump administration has largely targeted trans people 19 years old and younger in its attacks on gender-affirming care, Republicans have signaled for at least a year that they would come for adult care soon after. Trump\u2019s orders temporarily led some hospitals to deny gender-affirming care to trans youth while continuing nonconsensual surgeries on intersex children. The CMS and HHS proposal also comes as the Supreme Court continues to deliberate in the landmark case U.S. v. Skrmetti, which could decide the legal fate of gender-affirming care for trans youth for years to come.\n\nIf you\u2019re reading this, however, you\u2019re not powerless. The CMS/HHS proposal is now listed in the Federal Register, where rule changes are required to be posted for members of the public to comment. (Comments do not need to include a person\u2019s name or other identifying information.) As we\u2019ve reported previously, public comment can be an effective tool for voicing dissent: even if officials do adopt the rule, it will be challenged in court (Secretary of State Marco Rubio\u2019s comments about dismantling certain courts notwithstanding), at which point lawyers will be able to draw on public comments as part of the official record to bolster their case.\n\nAt the time of writing, the proposal had received over 5,000 comments, many of them opposing the ban on gender-affirming care. The comment period will end on April 11.\n\n\u201cThere is no upside to intentionally being cruel to people,\u201d one commenter wrote this week. \u201cThis is deeply off-putting and strange to me, as a regular voter, and it makes me feel like my government wants its people to just drop dead.\u201d\n\nUpdate 3/27/25: A previous version of this article mischaracterized the proposed rule.",
