  "content": "The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is probing \"a major pediatric teaching hospital\" over the alleged firing of a nurse who sought a religious exemption to avoid administering puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones to children.\n\n\"The Department will robustly enforce federal laws protecting these courageous whistleblowers, including laws that protect healthcare professionals from being forced to violate their religious beliefs or moral convictions,\" Acting HHS OCR Director Anthony Archeval said in a statement.\n\nWhile HHS has not confirmed the hospital\u2019s identity, it is believed to be Texas Children\u2019s Hospital (TCH) \u2014 the largest children\u2019s hospital in the U.S. \u2014 as the investigation follows whistleblower nurse Vanessa Sivadge\u2019s testimony on Capitol Hill. Sivadge first came forward publicly in June 2024 and was later fired in August 2024. Sivadge told lawmakers that she had witnessed \"disturbing trends and concerning practices\" relating to the treatment of children diagnosed with gender dysphoria. She also said that she \"observed the powerful and irreversible effects\" of treatments that patients were told were \"lifesaving.\" \n\n\"I witnessed firsthand how doctors emotionally blackmailed parents by telling them that if they did not affirm their child\u2019s false identity, their child would harm themselves. In particular, I was saddened to see young girls suffering from profound mental health struggles like depression and anxiety, many of whom had also suffered sexual abuse or trauma, persuaded by doctors at Texas Children\u2019s that a hormone would resolve their gender confusion,\" Sivadge told lawmakers.\n\nDr. Eithan Haim, who was accused of violating HIPAA while in surgical training at Baylor College of Medicine, which is affiliated with TCH, also blew the whistle on the hospital for \"lying about the existence of its transgender program.\" The Biden DOJ brought charges against Haim for the alleged HIPAA violations, but the case was ultimately dropped under the Trump administration.\n\nHaim claimed the hospital was engaging in fraudulent billing practices to hide the fact that it was carrying out transgender procedures on minors even though it was against Texas law. This included recording mastectomies as \"breast reduction\" surgeries and billing testosterone prescribed to a teen girl under a male diagnosis.\n\nIn her testimony, Sivadge said that federal agents came to her home when investigating the whistleblower, now known to be Haim, because of her objections to transgender medicine. She described the interaction as intimidating and said that one of the special agents \"effectively asked me to compromise my Christian beliefs and made veiled threats regarding my career and safety if I didn\u2019t comply with their demands.\"\n\nSivadge's attorney filed a complaint with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) on April 11, alleging that she \"observed TCH doctors, after very little deliberation or critical analysis, embarking children on dangerous and often irreversible courses of \u2018gender-affirming\u2019 treatment.\"\n\nAccording to the complaint, TCH \"temporarily\" paused \"gender-affirming services\" for minors after Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said in February 2022 that such treatments could constitute child abuse. The treatments were banned in the state following the passage of a bill in May 2023, which went into effect in September 2023. According to Sivadge's attorney, she asked to be transferred back to cardiology in May 2024, citing her religious beliefs. \n\nSivadge publicly blew the whistle on TCH on June 18, 2024, and was asked not to report to work the next day, according to the complaint. Just days later, on June 21, she was placed on administrative leave and was officially terminated in August 2024. TCH alleged that the termination of her employment was due to improper access to medical records.\n\nOn Jan. 28, 2025, President Donald Trump signed the \"Protecting Children from Chemical and Surgical Mutilation\" order, which prevents minors from undergoing transgender treatments. In accordance with this order, HHS has issued guidelines for prospective whistleblowers.\n\nFox News has reached out to TCH and HHS for comment.\n\n",
