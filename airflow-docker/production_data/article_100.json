The order includes inaccurate and inflammatory language about Americans who capably and honorably serve their country, and have for years, with zero negative impact on military readiness or effectiveness.\nThe order gives the Defense Secretary 60 days to complete this task. The Defense Secretary has a vast record of mismanagement, personal misconduct, and violent and inaccurate statements against women and female service members, including allegations of sexual assault.\nThere is no evidence to support the Trump administration\u2019s claims.\nThere is no evidence that gender identity has a negative impact on capacity to serve. \nThere is research to show Trump\u2019s previous ban on trans service had a negative impact on military readiness, unit cohesion, and national security.\n56 generals, admirals, and other leaders from every service branch condemned Trump\u2019s previous attempt to bar open service, noting it would \u201cdegrade readiness even more than the failed \u2018don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u2019 policy.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s executive order discriminates and spreads disinformation about an entire group of Americans. It is also in conflict with Trump\u2019s discriminatory Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion rollbacks which say it is illegal to discriminate based on sex. Trump\u2019s orders are lawless and incoherent.\nMajorities of the American public and military personnel have long supported open transgender military service.\nAt least 30 countries allow open service for transgender military personnel, including the UK and Israel.\nHealth care for transgender people is supported by every major medical association. Many of the same treatments are also safely prescribed to cisgender people to affirm their gender. There is no evidence to support Trump claims that trans health care negatively impacts ability to serve.\nDonald Trump never served in the military and deferred himself from service multiple times based on fraudulent medical claims. Trump\u2019s record of targeting LGBTQ people is documented on the Trump Accountability Tracker. \nGLAAD\u2019s President and CEO Sarah Kate Ellis (she/her) issued the following statement:\n\u201cTransgender people are already serving in the military with honor and keeping our country and military safer and stronger. They meet the same rigorous health and readiness standards, and continue to do so. The Trump administration\u2019s inaccurate statements and rhetoric targeting transgender people are not based on facts. LGBTQ Americans have been here before, ending \u2018Don\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell\u2019 and Trump\u2019s previous trans military ban. Research and military experts have made it loud and clear that targeting service members because of who they are is blatantly discriminatory and makes our country less safe.\u201d\n\nSPARTA Pride:\n\u201cTransgender Americans have served openly and honorably in the U.S. Armed Forces for nearly a decade. Thousands of transgender troops are currently serving, and are fully qualified for the positions in which they serve. Transgender service members currently fill critical roles in combat arms, aviation, nuclear engineering, law enforcement, and military intelligence, many requiring years of specialized training and expertise. Transgender troops have deployed to combat zones, served in high-stakes missions, and demonstrated their ability to strengthen unit cohesion and morale.\u201d\n\nAlaina Kupec (she/her), a transgender veteran, former US Naval Intelligence Officer, GRACE Founder and President:\n\u201cAcross the world today, countless transgender service members are defending our nation\u2019s freedom, at the very same time their freedom is being taken away from them. These sailors, marines, airmen and soldiers serve our country with the utmost honor, and many have served long successful careers. Prohibiting transgender individuals from service undermines our nation\u2019s values and readiness at the very moment our military is needed. Whether they serve in the Red Sea, the Asia-Pacific region, or here close to home, they serve so that so many Americans do not have to. This policy eschews our nation\u2019s values of liberty and justice for all. This distraction aids our nation\u2019s enemies by destabilizing our fighting forces. Those in command of transgender service members are now left to wonder how their staffing gaps will be filled. And transgender service members are now worried about their futures instead of focusing on doing their job defending our nation.\u201d\n\nRep. Leigh Finke (she/her), the first out transgender member of the Minnesota House of Representatives, responded on CNN:\n\u201cThese are glorified press releases meant to scare people and to create uncertainty, meant to push people towards discrimination of transgender people and will be very difficult to enforce, and will take upwards of a year to figure out if this is even going to be possible. In the meantime it\u2019s going to expose trans folks and make our lives more difficult.\u201d\n\nOther advocates doing important work to support LGBTQ service members include Modern Military Association of America, which provides a united voice for LGBTQ+ military and veteran communities and works to uphold and expand the civil rights progress made on behalf of LGBTQ+ service members, veterans, and their families.\n\nAdditional background:\n\nAs with most of Pres.

Not only is such a move cruel, it compromises the safety and security of our country and is particularly dangerous and wrong. As we promised then, so do we now: we will sue.
